OF my city the worst that men will ever say is this:	
You took little children away from the sun and the dew,	
And the glimmers that played in the grass under the great sky,	
And the reckless rain; you put them between walls	
To work, broken and smothered, for bread and wages,	        
To eat dust in their throats and die empty-hearted	
For a little handful of pay on a few Saturday nights.
