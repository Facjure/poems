# Restore Poems Together

Thousands of poems in the public domain live buried in school libraries, archaic websites, journals gone out of print. We don't have a free, unified access. A github library.

Let's build one.

## Overview

Three parts: format, metadata, scripts.

1. To restore poems, we need a new format that can be read by humans and machines alike
2. To curate poems, we need a way to add metadata, inline, read by humans and machines
3. Scripts provide researchers a way to analyze, find, view, and print poems

## Status

Poetroid LLC has restored 40,000 poems so far. The script were started in Python, and are now ad-hoc. Frustrated with a lack of understanding of several dozen tools to scrape the web, I decided to focus on other things, like the [format of data](https://github.com/poetroid/zenup), for example.
