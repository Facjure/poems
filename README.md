# Poetroid - Discover Poetry Together

There are tens of thousands of poems in the public domain, yet no single repository. Let's build one.

## Format

Poems are written in plain text in [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) format to preserve foreign & special characters, and [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), another plain text format, for storing tags and meta data.

The format can change in the future to [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn), for example, and if it occurs, the process of upgrading old poems will be automated.

## Status

Once entered in the above format, these poems will be fed into our ai engine running on the cloud, clustered and distributed across nodes, where each node analyzes, transforms, and writes a taxonomy of poetry built by humans.

This repo is the "master" data store, poetroid, a web platform built with ai in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) to search, discover, and share art and poetry together. The app is currently in *research & development*, therefore--**not stable**.


However, an early prototype exists on (http://poetroid.com/) showing a poem per page, line endings saved, aligned typographically to the size of your screen. There's also an in-line, markdown based editor with live preview available to curators and educators. If you're interested to contribyte 

a basic tool on poetroid, where you can edit a poem in raw format, save, and view the updated poem on the site in 30 seconds or less. 

An early version of this app, written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [Javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is available in a private github repo, on a request.
