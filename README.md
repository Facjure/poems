# Restore Poems Together

Thousands of poems in the public domain live buried in school libraries, archaic websites, journals gone out of print. We don't have a free, unified access. A github library.

Let's build one.

## Rationale

See [Zenup](https://github.com/poetroid/zenup).

## Status

Poetroid LLC has restored 50,000 poems so far. The script were started in Python, and are now ad-hoc.

## Resources

- [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org)
- [Public Domain Poetry](http://www.public-domain-poetry.com)

## Contributers

- Priyatam Mudivarti
- Ata Moharreri (poeta and teacher)
- Sreeharsha Mudivarti, musician
