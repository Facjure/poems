# Poetroid - Discover Poetry Together

Poems are taken from the [public domain](http://www.gutenberg.org) and written in plain text in [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) format to preserve foreign & special characters in its original form, and [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), another plain text format, for storing tags and meta data.

Once collected, these poems will be fed to our search engine, complete with analysis and custom typography, ready to be viewed from any browser, device, mobile or tablet—no app required—for users to read, curate, and dicover poetry together.

Currently in *alpha*.

If you're interested in becoming a curator, request access by sending an email to priyatam@facjure.com and signup for a free [github](https://github.com/) account.
