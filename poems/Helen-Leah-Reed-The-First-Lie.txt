I'm sure I did not break this cup;
It just fell down, - I know it did - 
For I was only climbing up,
 Why do they keep the cake-box hid? - 
I wanted such a little bit!
And then I heard that creaking door,
I can't tell what it was I hit,
Nor how that cup got on the floor.

The shelf it stood on was too high,
That cup my mother loved the most!
Oh dear! I never told a lie,
And mother whispered, "Do not boast,"
The day I said I never could.
(But there's that broken cup!) - and then
I promised that I never would - 
So - I'll not tell a lie -again.
