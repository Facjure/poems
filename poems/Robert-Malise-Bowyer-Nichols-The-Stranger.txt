Never am I so alone
 As when I walk among the crowd -
Blurred masks of stern or grinning stone,
 Unmeaning eyes and voices loud.

Gaze dares not encounter gaze, ...
 Humbled, I turn my head aside;
When suddenly there is a face ...
 Pale, subdued and grievous-eyed.

Ah, I know that visage meek,
 Those trembling lips, the eyes that shine
But turn from that which they would seek
 With an air piteous, divine!

There is not a line or scar,
 Seal of a sorrow or disgrace,
But I know like sigils are
 Burned in my heart and on my face.

Speak! O speak! Thou art the one!
 But thou hast passed with sad head bowed;
And never am I so alone
 As when I walk among the crowd.
