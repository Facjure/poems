 Argument Of The Fifth Book.


Diomede is extraordinarily distinguished. He kills Pandarus, who had violated the truce, and wounds first Venus and then Mars.



 Then Athen�an Pallas on the son
 Of Tydeus,[1] Diomede, new force conferr'd
 And daring courage, that the Argives all
 He might surpass, and deathless fame achieve.
 Fires on his helmet and his shield around
 She kindled, bright and steady as the star
 Autumnal,[2] which in Ocean newly bathed
 Assumes fresh beauty; with such glorious beams
 His head encircling and his shoulders broad,
 She urged him forth into the thickest fight.
 There lived a man in Troy, Dares his name,
 The priest of Vulcan; rich he was and good,
 The father of two sons, Id�us this,
 That, Phegeus call'd; accomplish'd warriors both.
 These, issuing from their phalanx, push'd direct
 Their steeds at Diomede, who fought on foot.
 When now small interval was left between,
 First Phegeus his long-shadow'd spear dismiss'd;
 But over Diomede's left shoulder pass'd
 The point, innocuous. Then his splendid lance
 Tydides hurl'd; nor ineffectual flew
 The weapon from his hand, but Phegeus pierced
 His paps between, and forced him to the ground.
 At once, his sumptuous chariot left, down leap'd
 Id�sus, wanting courage to defend
 His brother slain; nor had he scaped himself
 His louring fate, but Vulcan, to preserve
 His ancient priest from unmixt sorrow, snatch'd
 The fugitive in darkness wrapt, away.
 Then brave Tydides, driving off the steeds,
 Consign'd them to his fellow-warriors' care,
 That they might lead them down into the fleet.
 The valiant Trojans, when they saw the sons
 Of Dares, one beside his chariot slain,
 And one by flight preserved, through all their host
 Felt consternation. Then Minerva seized
 The hand of fiery Mars, and thus she spake.
 Gore-tainted homicide, town-battering Mars!
 Leave we the Trojans and the Greeks to wage
 Fierce fight alone, Jove prospering whom he will,
 So shall we not provoke our father's ire.
 She said, and from the fight conducted forth
 The impetuous Deity, whom on the side
 She seated of Scamander deep-embank'd.[3]
 And now the host of Troy to flight inclined
 Before the Grecians, and the Chiefs of Greece
 Each slew a warrior. Agamemnon first
 Gigantic Odius from his chariot hurl'd.
 Chief of the Halizonians. He to flight
 Turn'd foremost, when the monarch in his spine
 Between the shoulder-bones his spear infixt,
 And urged it through his breast. Sounding he fell,
 And loud his batter'd armor rang around.
 By brave Idomeneus a Lydian died,
 Ph�stus, from fruitful Tarne sent to Troy,
 Son of M�onian Borus; him his steeds
 Mounting, Idomeneus the spear-renown'd
 Through his right shoulder pierced; unwelcome night
 Involved him; from his chariot down he fell,[4]
 And the attendant Cretans stripp'd his arms.
 But Menelaus, son of Atreus slew
 With his bright spear Scamandrius, Stropius' son,
 A skilful hunter; for Diana him,
 Herself, the slaughter of all savage kinds
 Had taught, on mountain or in forest bred.
 But she, shaft-aiming Goddess, in that hour
 Avail'd him not, nor his own matchless skill;
 For Menelaus, Atreus son spear-famed,
 Him flying wounded in the spine between
 His shoulders, and the spear urged through his breast.
 Prone on his loud-resounding arms he fell.
 Next, by Meriones, Phereclus died,
 Son of Harmonides. All arts that ask
 A well-instructed hand his sire had learn'd,
 For Pallas dearly loved him. He the fleet,
 Prime source of harm to Troy and to himself,
 For Paris built, unskill'd to spell aright
 The oracles predictive of the wo.
 Phereclus fled; Meriones his flight
 Outstripping, deep in his posterior flesh
 A spear infix'd; sliding beneath the bone
 It grazed his bladder as it pass'd, and stood
 Protruded far before. Low on his knees
 Phereclus sank, and with a shriek expired.
 Ped�us, whom, although his spurious son,
 Antenor's wife, to gratify her lord,
 Had cherish'd as her own--him Meges slew.
 Warlike Phylides[5] following close his flight,
 His keen lance drove into his poll, cut sheer
 His tongue within, and through his mouth enforced
 The glittering point. He, prostrate in the dust,
 The cold steel press'd between his teeth and died.
 Eurypylus, Evemon's son, the brave
 Hypsenor slew; Dolopion was his sire,
 Priest of Scamander, reverenced as a God.
 In vain before Eurypylus he fled;
 He, running, with his falchion lopp'd his arm
 Fast by the shoulder; on the field his hand
 Fell blood-distained, and destiny severe
 With shades of death for ever veil'd his eyes.
 Thus strenuous they the toilsome battle waged.
 But where Tydides fought, whether in aid
 Of Ilium's host, or on the part of Greece,
 Might none discern. For as a winter-flood
 Impetuous, mounds and bridges sweeps away;[6]
 The buttress'd bridge checks not its sudden force,
 The firm inclosure of vine-planted fields
 Luxuriant, falls before it; finish'd works
 Of youthful hinds, once pleasant to the eye,
 Now levell'd, after ceaseless rain from Jove;
 So drove Tydides into sudden flight
 The Trojans; phalanx after phalanx fled
 Before the terror of his single arm.
 When him Lycaon's son illustrious saw
 Scouring the field, and from before his face
 The ranks dispersing wide, at once he bent
 Against Tydides his elastic bow.
 The arrow met him in his swift career
 Sure-aim'd; it struck direct the hollow mail
 Of his right shoulder, with resistless force
 Transfix'd it, and his hauberk stain'd with blood.
 Loud shouted then Lycaon's son renown'd.
 Rush on, ye Trojans, spur your coursers hard.
 Our fiercest foe is wounded, and I deem
 His death not distant far, if me the King[7]
 Jove's son, indeed, from Lycia sent to Troy.
 So boasted Pandarus. Yet him the dart
 Quell'd not. Retreating, at his coursers' heads
 He stood, and to the son of Capaneus
 His charioteer and faithful friend he said.
 Arise, sweet son of Capaneus, dismount,
 And from my shoulder draw this bitter shaft.
 He spake; at once the son of Capaneus
 Descending, by its barb the bitter shaft
 Drew forth; blood spouted through his twisted mail
 Incontinent, and thus the Hero pray'd.
 Unconquer'd daughter of Jove �gis-arm'd!
 If ever me, propitious, or my sire
 Thou hast in furious fight help'd heretofore,
 Now aid me also. Bring within the reach
 Of my swift spear, Oh grant me to strike through
 The warrior who hath check'd my course, and boasts
 The sun's bright beams for ever quench'd to me![8]
 He prayed, and Pallas heard; she braced his limbs,
 She wing'd him with alacrity divine,
 And, standing at his side, him thus bespake.
 Now Diomede, be bold! Fight now with Troy.
 To thee, thy father's spirit I impart
 Fearless; shield-shaking Tydeus felt the same.
 I also from thine eye the darkness purge
 Which dimm'd thy sight[9] before, that thou may'st know
 Both Gods and men; should, therefore, other God
 Approach to try thee, fight not with the powers
 Immortal; but if foam-born Venus come,
 Her spare not. Wound her with thy glittering spear.
 So spake the blue-eyed Deity, and went,
 Then with the champions in the van again
 Tydides mingled; hot before, he fights
 With threefold fury now, nor less enraged
 Than some gaunt lion whom o'erleaping light
 The fold, a shepherd hath but gall'd, not kill'd,
 Him irritating more; thenceforth the swain
 Lurks unresisting; flies the abandon'd flock;
 Heaps slain on heaps he leaves, and with a bound
 Surmounting all impediment, escapes;
 Such seem'd the valiant Diomede incensed
 To fury, mingling with the host of Troy.
 Astyno�s and Hypenor first he slew;
 One with his brazen lance above the pap
 He pierced, and one with his huge falchion smote
 Fast by the key-bone,[10] from the neck and spine
 His parted shoulder driving at a blow.
 Them leaving, Polyides next he sought
 And Abas, sons of a dream-dealing seer,
 Eurydamas; their hoary father's dreams
 Or not interpreted, or kept concealed,
 Them saved not, for by Diomede they died.
 Xanthus and Th�on he encounter'd next,
 Both sons of Ph�nops, sons of his old age,
 Who other heir had none of all his wealth,
 Nor hoped another, worn with many years.
 Tydides slew them both; nor aught remain'd
 To the old man but sorrow for his sons
 For ever lost, and strangers were his heirs.
 Two sons of Priam in one chariot borne
 Echemon next, and Chromius felt his hand
 Resistless. As a lion on the herd
 Leaping, while they the shrubs and bushes browse,
 Breaks short the neck of heifer or of steer,
 So them, though clinging fast and loth to fall,
 Tydides hurl'd together to the ground,
 Then stripp'd their splendid armor, and the steeds
 Consigned and chariot to his soldiers' care.
 �neas him discern'd scattering the ranks,
 And through the battle and the clash of spears
 Went seeking godlike Pandarus; ere long
 Finding Lycaon's martial son renown'd,
 He stood before him, and him thus address'd.
 Thy bow, thy feather'd shafts, and glorious name
 Where are they, Pandarus? whom none of Troy
 Could equal, whom of Lycia, none excel.
 Come. Lift thine hands to Jove, and at yon Chief
 Dispatch an arrow, who afflicts the host
 Of Ilium thus, conquering where'er he flies,
 And who hath slaughter'd numerous brave in arms,
 But him some Deity I rather deem
 Avenging on us his neglected rites,
 And who can stand before an angry God?
 Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd.
 Brave leader of the Trojans brazen-mail'd,
 �neas! By his buckler which I know,
 And by his helmet's height, considering, too
 His steeds, I deem him Diomede the bold;
 Yet such pronounce him not, who seems a God.
 But if bold Diomede indeed he be
 Of whom I speak, not without aid from heaven
 His fury thus prevails, but at his side
 Some God, in clouds enveloped, turns away
 From him the arrow to a devious course.
 Already, at his shoulder's hollow mail
 My shaft hath pierced him through, and him I deem'd
 Dismiss'd full sure to Pluto ere his time
 But he survives; whom therefore I at last
 Perforce conclude some angry Deity.
 Steeds have I none or chariot to ascend,
 Who have eleven chariots in the stands
 Left of Lycaon, with fair hangings all
 O'ermantled, strong, new finish'd, with their steeds
 In pairs beside them, eating winnow'd grain.
 Me much Lycaon my old valiant sire
 At my departure from his palace gates
 Persuaded, that my chariot and my steeds
 Ascending, I should so conduct my bands
 To battle; counsel wise, and ill-refused!
 But anxious, lest (the host in Troy so long
 Immew'd) my steeds, fed plenteously at home,
 Should here want food, I left them, and on foot
 To Ilium came, confiding in my bow
 Ordain'd at last to yield me little good.
 Twice have I shot, and twice I struck the mark,
 First Menelaus, and Tydides next;
 From each I drew the blood, true, genuine blood,
 Yet have but more incensed them. In an hour
 Unfortunate, I therefore took my bow
 Down from the wall that day, when for the sake
 Of noble Hector, to these pleasant plains
 I came, a leader on the part of Troy.
 But should I once return, and with these eyes
 Again behold my native land, my sire,
 My wife, my stately mansion, may the hand,
 That moment, of some adversary there
 Shorten me by the head, if I not snap
 This bow with which I charged myself in vain,
 And burn the unprofitable tool to dust.
 To whom �neas, Trojan Chief, replied.
 Nay, speak not so. For ere that hour arrive
 We will, with chariot and with horse, in arms
 Encounter him, and put his strength to proof.
 Delay not, mount my chariot. Thou shalt see
 With what rapidity the steeds of Troy
 Pursuing or retreating, scour the field.
 If after all, Jove purpose still to exalt
 The son of Tydeus, these shall bear us safe
 Back to the city. Come then. Let us on.
 The lash take thou, and the resplendent reins,
 While I alight for battle, or thyself
 Receive them, and the steeds shall be my care.
 Him answer'd then Lycaon's son renown'd.
 �neas! manage thou the reins, and guide
 Thy proper steeds. If fly at last we must
 The son of Tydeus, they will readier draw
 Directed by their wonted charioteer.
 Else, terrified, and missing thy control,
 They may refuse to bear us from the fight,
 And Tydeus' son assailing us, with ease
 Shall slay us both, and drive thy steeds away.
 Rule therefore thou the chariot, and myself
 With my sharp spear will his assault receive.
 So saying, they mounted both, and furious drove
 Against Tydides. Them the noble son
 Of Capaneus observed, and turning quick
 His speech to Diomede, him thus address'd.
 Tydides, Diomede, my heart's delight!
 Two warriors of immeasurable force
 In battle, ardent to contend with thee,
 Come rattling on. Lycaon's offspring one,
 Bow-practised Pandarus; with whom appears
 �neas; he who calls the mighty Chief
 Anchises father, and whom Venus bore.
 Mount--drive we swift away--lest borne so far
 Beyond the foremost battle, thou be slain.
 To whom, dark-frowning, Diomede replied
 Speak not of flight to me, who am disposed
 To no such course. I am ashamed to fly
 Or tremble, and my strength is still entire;
 I cannot mount. No. Rather thus, on foot,
 I will advance against them. Fear and dread
 Are not for me; Pallas forbids the thought.
 One falls, be sure; swift as they are, the steeds
 That whirl them on, shall never rescue both.
 But hear my bidding, and hold fast the word.
 Should all-wise Pallas grant me my desire
 To slay them both, drive not my coursers hence,
 But hook the reins, and seizing quick the pair
 That draw �neas, urge them from the powers
 Of Troy away into the host of Greece.
 For they are sprung from those which Jove to Tros
 In compensation gave for Ganymede;
 The Sun himself sees not their like below.
 Anchises, King of men, clandestine them
 Obtain'd, his mares submitting to the steeds
 Of King Laomedon. Six brought him foals;
 Four to himself reserving, in his stalls
 He fed them sleek, and two he gave his son:
 These, might we win them, were a noble prize.
 Thus mutual they conferr'd; those Chiefs, the while,
 With swiftest pace approach'd, and first his speech
 To Diomede Lycaon's son address'd.
 Heroic offspring of a noble sire,
 Brave son of Tydeus! false to my intent
 My shaft hath harm'd thee little. I will now
 Make trial with my spear, if that may speed.
 He said, and shaking his long-shadow'd spear,
 Dismiss'd it. Forceful on the shield it struck
 Of Diomede, transpierced it, and approach'd
 With threatening point the hauberk on his breast.
 Loud shouted Pandarus--Ah nobly thrown!
 Home to thy bowels. Die, for die thou must,
 And all the glory of thy death is mine.
 Then answer thus brave Diomede return'd
 Undaunted. I am whole. Thy cast was short.
 But ye desist not, as I plain perceive,
 Till one at least extended on the plain
 Shall sate the God of battles with his blood.
 He said and threw. Pallas the spear herself
 Directed; at his eye fast by the nose
 Deep-entering, through his ivory teeth it pass'd,
 At its extremity divided sheer
 His tongue, and started through his chin below.
 He headlong fell, and with his dazzling arms
 Smote full the plain. Back flew the fiery steeds
 With swift recoil, and where he fell he died.
 Then sprang �neas forth with spear and shield,
 That none might drag the body;[11] lion-like
 He stalk'd around it, oval shield and spear
 Advancing firm, and with incessant cries
 Terrific, death denouncing on his foes.
 But Diomede with hollow grasp a stone
 Enormous seized, a weight to overtask
 Two strongest men of such as now are strong,
 Yet he, alone, wielded the rock with ease.
 Full on the hip he smote him, where the thigh
 Rolls in its cavity, the socket named.
 He crushed the socket, lacerated wide
 Both tendons, and with that rough-angled mass
 Flay'd all his flesh, The Hero on his knees
 Sank, on his ample palm his weight upbore
 Laboring, and darkness overspread his eyes.
 There had �neas perish'd, King of men,
 Had not Jove's daughter Venus quick perceived
 His peril imminent, whom she had borne
 Herself to Anchises pasturing his herds.
 Her snowy arras her darling son around
 She threw maternal, and behind a fold
 Of her bright mantle screening close his breast
 From mortal harm by some brave Grecian's spear,
 Stole him with eager swiftness from the fight.
 Nor then forgat brave Sthenelus his charge
 Received from Diomede, but his own steeds
 Detaining distant from the boisterous war,
 Stretch'd tight the reins, and hook'd them fast behind.
 The coursers of �neas next he seized
 Ardent, and them into the host of Greece
 Driving remote, consign'd them to his care,
 Whom far above all others his compeers
 He loved, Deipylus, his bosom friend
 Congenial. Him he charged to drive them thence
 Into the fleet, then, mounting swift his own,
 Lash'd after Diomede; he, fierce in arms,
 Pursued the Cyprian Goddess, conscious whom,
 Not Pallas, not Enyo, waster dread
 Of cities close-beleaguer'd, none of all
 Who o'er the battle's bloody course preside,
 But one of softer kind and prone to fear.
 When, therefore, her at length, after long chase
 Through all the warring multitude he reach'd,
 With his protruded spear her gentle hand
 He wounded, piercing through her thin attire
 Ambrosial, by themselves the graces wrought,
 Her inside wrist, fast by the rosy palm.
 Blood follow'd, but immortal; ichor pure,
 Such as the blest inhabitants of heaven
 May bleed, nectareous; for the Gods eat not
 Man's food, nor slake as he with sable wine
 Their thirst, thence bloodless and from death exempt.
 She, shrieking, from her arms cast down her son,
 And Phoebus, in impenetrable clouds
 Him hiding, lest the spear of some brave Greek
 Should pierce his bosom, caught him swift away.
 Then shouted brave Tydides after her--
 Depart, Jove's daughter! fly the bloody field.
 Is't not enough that thou beguilest the hearts
 Of feeble women? If thou dare intrude
 Again into the war, war's very name
 Shall make thee shudder, wheresoever heard.
 He said, and Venus with excess of pain
 Bewilder'd went; but Iris tempest-wing'd
 Forth led her through the multitude, oppress'd
 With anguish, her white wrist to livid changed.
 They came where Mars far on the left retired
 Of battle sat, his horses and his spear
 In darkness veil'd. Before her brother's knees
 She fell, and with entreaties urgent sought
 The succor of his coursers golden-rein'd.
 Save me, my brother! Pity me! Thy steeds
 Give me, that they may bear me to the heights
 Olympian, seat of the immortal Gods!
 Oh! I am wounded deep; a mortal man
 Hath done it, Diomede; nor would he fear
 This day in fight the Sire himself of all.
 Then Mars his coursers gold-caparison'd
 Resign'd to Venus; she, with countenance sad,
 The chariot climb'd, and Iris at her side
 The bright reins seizing lash'd the ready steeds.
 Soon as the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods,
 They reach'd, wing-footed Iris loosing quick
 The coursers, gave them large whereon to browse
 Ambrosial food; but Venus on the knees
 Sank of Dione, who with folded arms
 Maternal, to her bosom straining close
 Her daughter, stroked her cheek, and thus inquired.
 My darling child! who? which of all the Gods
 Hath rashly done such violence to thee
 As if convicted of some open wrong?
 Her then the Goddess of love-kindling smiles
 Venus thus answer'd; Diomede the proud,
 Audacious Diomede; he gave the wound,
 For that I stole �neas from the fight
 My son of all mankind my most beloved;
 Nor is it now the war of Greece with Troy,
 But of the Grecians with the Gods themselves.
 Then thus Dione, Goddess all divine.
 My child! how hard soe'er thy sufferings seem
 Endure them patiently. Full many a wrong
 From human hands profane the Gods endure,
 And many a painful stroke, mankind from ours.
 Mars once endured much wrong, when on a time
 Him Otus bound and Ephialtes fast,
 Sons of Al�eus, and full thirteen moons
 In brazen thraldom held him. There, at length,
 The fierce blood-nourished Mars had pined away,
 But that E�riboea, loveliest nymph,
 His step-mother, in happy hour disclosed
 To Mercury the story of his wrongs;
 He stole the prisoner forth, but with his woes
 Already worn, languid and fetter-gall'd.
 Nor Juno less endured, when erst the bold
 Son of Amphytrion with tridental shaft
 Her bosom pierced; she then the misery felt
 Of irremediable pain severe.
 Nor suffer'd Pluto less, of all the Gods
 Gigantic most, by the same son of Jove
 Alcides, at the portals of the dead
 Transfix'd and fill'd with anguish; he the house
 Of Jove and the Olympian summit sought
 Dejected, torture-stung, for sore the shaft
 Oppress'd him, into his huge shoulder driven.
 But P�on[12] him not liable to death
 With unction smooth of salutiferous balms
 Heal'd soon. Presumptuous, sacrilegious man!
 Careless what dire enormities he wrought,
 Who bent his bow against the powers of heaven!
 But blue-eyed Pallas instigated him
 By whom thou bleed'st. Infatuate! he forgets
 That whoso turns against the Gods his arm
 Lives never long; he never, safe escaped
 From furious fight, the lisp'd caresses hears
 Of his own infants prattling at his knees.
 Let therefore Diomede beware, lest strong
 And valiant as he is, he chance to meet
 Some mightier foe than thou, and lest his wife,
 Daughter of King Adrastus, the discrete
 �gialea, from portentous dreams
 Upstarting, call her family to wail
 Her first-espoused, Achaia's proudest boast,
 Diomede, whom she must behold no more.
 She said, and from her wrist with both hands wiped
 The trickling ichor; the effectual touch
 Divine chased all her pains, and she was heal'd.
 Them Juno mark'd and Pallas, and with speech
 Sarcastic pointed at Saturnian Jove
 To vex him, blue-eyed Pallas thus began.
 Eternal father! may I speak my thought,
 And not incense thee, Jove? I can but judge
 That Venus, while she coax'd some Grecian fair
 To accompany the Trojans whom she loves
 With such extravagance, hath heedless stroked
 Her golden clasps, and scratch'd her lily hand.
 So she; then smiled the sire of Gods and men,
 And calling golden Venus, her bespake.
 War and the tented field, my beauteous child,
 Are not for thee. Thou rather shouldst be found
 In scenes of matrimonial bliss. The toils
 Of war to Pallas and to Mars belong.
 Thus they in heaven. But Diomede the while
 Sprang on �neas, conscious of the God
 Whose hand o'ershadow'd him, yet even him
 Regarding lightly; for he burn'd to slay
 �neas, and to seize his glorious arms.
 Thrice then he sprang impetuous to the deed,
 And thrice Apollo with his radiant shield
 Repulsed him. But when ardent as a God
 The fourth time he advanced, with thundering-voice
 Him thus the Archer of the skies rebuked.
 Think, and retire, Tydides! nor affect
 Equality with Gods; for not the same
 Our nature is and theirs who tread the ground.
 He spake, and Diomede a step retired,
 Not more; the anger of the Archer-God
 Declining slow, and with a sullen awe.
 Then Phoebus, far from all the warrior throng
 To his own shrine the sacred dome beneath
 Of Pergamus, �neas bore; there him
 Latona and shaft-arm'd Diana heal'd
 And glorified within their spacious fane.
 Meantime the Archer of the silver bow
 A visionary form prepared; it seem'd
 Himself �neas, and was arm'd as he.
 At once, in contest for that airy form,
 Grecians and Trojans on each other's breasts
 The bull-hide buckler batter'd and light targe.
 Then thus Apollo to the warrior God.
 Gore-tainted homicide, town-batterer Mars!
 Wilt thou not meet and from the fight withdraw
 This man Tydides, now so fiery grown
 That he would even cope with Jove himself?
 First Venus' hand he wounded, and assail'd
 Impetuous as a God, next, even me.
 He ceased, and on the topmost turret sat
 Of Pergamus. Then all-destroyer Mars
 Ranging the Trojan host, rank after rank
 Exhorted loud, and in the form assumed
 Of Acamas the Thracian leader bold,
 The godlike sons of Priam thus harangued.
 Ye sons of Priam, monarch Jove-beloved!
 How long permit ye your Achaian foes
 To slay the people?--till the battle rage
 (Push'd home to Ilium) at her solid gates?
 Behold--a Chief disabled lies, than whom
 We reverence not even Hector more,
 �neas; fly, save from the roaring storm
 The noble Anchisiades your friend.
 He said; then every heart for battle glow'd;
 And thus Sarpedon with rebuke severe
 Upbraiding generous Hector, stern began.
 Where is thy courage, Hector? for thou once
 Hadst courage. Is it fled? In other days
 Thy boast hath been that without native troops
 Or foreign aids, thy kindred and thyself
 Alone, were guard sufficient for the town.
 But none of all thy kindred now appears;
 I can discover none; they stand aloof
 Quaking, as dogs that hear the lion's roar.
 We bear the stress, who are but Troy's allies;
 Myself am such, and from afar I came;
 For Lycia lies far distant on the banks
 Of the deep-eddied Xanthus. There a wife
 I left and infant son, both dear to me,
 With plenteous wealth, the wish of all who want.
 Yet urge I still my Lycians, and am prompt
 Myself to fight, although possessing here
 Nought that the Greeks can carry or drive hence.
 But there stand'st thou, neither employed thyself,
 Nor moving others to an active part
 For all their dearest pledges. Oh beware!
 Lest, as with meshes of an ample net,
 At one huge draught the Grecians sweep you all,
 And desolate at once your populous Troy!
 By day, by night, thoughts such as these should still
 Thy conduct influence, and from Chief to Chief
 Of the allies should send thee, praying each
 To make firm stand, all bickerings put away.
 So spake Sarpedon, and his reprimand
 Stung Hector; instant to the ground he leap'd
 All arm'd, and shaking his bright spears his host
 Ranged in all quarters animating loud
 His legions, and rekindling horrid war.
 Then, rolling back, the powers of Troy opposed
 Once more the Grecians, whom the Grecians dense
 Expected, unretreating, void of fear.
 As flies the chaff wide scatter'd by the wind
 O'er all the consecrated floor, what time
 Ripe Ceres[13] with brisk airs her golden grain
 Ventilates, whitening with its husk the ground;
 So grew the Achaians white, a dusty cloud
 Descending on their arms, which steeds with steeds
 Again to battle mingling, with their hoofs
 Up-stamp'd into the brazen vault of heaven;
 For now the charioteers turn'd all to fight.
 Host toward host with full collected force
 They moved direct. Then Mars through all the field
 Took wide his range, and overhung the war
 With night, in aid of Troy, at the command
 Of Phoebus of the golden sword; for he
 Perceiving Pallas from the field withdrawn,
 Patroness of the Greeks, had Mars enjoin'd
 To rouse the spirit of the Trojan host.
 Meantime Apollo from his unctuous shrine
 Sent forth restored and with new force inspired
 �neas. He amidst his warriors stood,
 Who him with joy beheld still living, heal'd,
 And all his strength possessing unimpair'd.
 Yet no man ask'd him aught. No leisure now
 For question was; far other thoughts had they;
 Such toils the archer of the silver bow,
 Wide-slaughtering Mars, and Discord as at first
 Raging implacable, for them prepared.
 Ulysses, either Ajax, Diomede--
 These roused the Greeks to battle, who themselves
 The force fear'd nothing, or the shouts of Troy,
 But steadfast stood, like clouds by Jove amass'd
 On lofty mountains, while the fury sleeps
 Of Boreas, and of all the stormy winds
 Shrill-voiced, that chase the vapors when they blow,
 So stood the Greeks, expecting firm the approach
 Of Ilium's powers, and neither fled nor fear'd.
 Then Agamemnon the embattled host
 On all sides ranging, cheer'd them. Now, he cried,
 Be steadfast, fellow warriors, now be men!
 Hold fast a sense of honor. More escape
 Of men who fear disgrace, than fall in fight,
 While dastards forfeit life and glory both.
 He said, and hurl'd his spear. He pierced a friend
 Of brave �neas, warring in the van,
 Deic�on son of Pergasus, in Troy
 Not less esteem'd than Priam's sons themselves,
 Such was his fame in foremost fight acquired.
 Him Agamemnon on his buckler smote,
 Nor stayed the weapon there, but through his belt
 His bowels enter'd, and with hideous clang
 And outcry[14] of his batter'd arms he fell.
 �neas next two mightiest warriors slew,
 Sons of Diocles, of a wealthy sire,
 Whose house magnificent in Ph�r� stood,
 Orsilochus and Crethon. Their descent
 From broad-stream'd Alpheus, Pylian flood, they drew.
 Alpheus begat Orsilochus, a prince
 Of numerous powers. Orsilochus begat
 Warlike Diodes. From Diodes sprang
 Twins, Crethon and Orsilochus, alike
 Valiant, and skilful in all forms of war.
 Their boyish prime scarce past, they, with the Greeks
 Embarking, in their sable ships had sail'd
 To steed-fam'd Ilium; just revenge they sought
 For Atreus' sons, but perished first themselves.
 As two young lions, in the deep recess
 Of some dark forest on the mountain's brow
 Late nourished by their dam, forth-issuing, seize
 The fatted flocks and kine, both folds and stalls
 Wasting rapacious, till, at length, themselves
 Deep-wounded perish by the hand of man,
 So they, both vanquish'd by �neas, fell,
 And like two lofty pines uprooted, lay.
 Them fallen in battle Menelaus saw
 With pity moved; radiant in arms he shook
 His brazen spear, and strode into the van.
 Mars urged him furious on, conceiving hope
 Of his death also by �neas' hand.
 But him the son of generous Nestor mark'd
 Antilochus, and to the foremost fight
 Flew also, fearing lest some dire mischance
 The Prince befalling, at one fatal stroke
 Should frustrate all the labors of the Greeks.
 They, hand to hand, and spear to spear opposed,
 Stood threatening dreadful onset, when beside
 The Spartan chief Antilochus appear'd.
 �neas, at the sight of two combined,
 Stood not, although intrepid. They the dead
 Thence drawing far into the Grecian host
 To their associates gave the hapless pair,
 Then, both returning, fought in front again.
 Next, fierce as Mars, Pyl�menes they slew,
 Prince of the shielded band magnanimous
 Of Paphlagonia. Him Atrides kill'd
 Spear-practised Menelaus, with a lance
 His throat transpiercing while erect he rode.
 Then, while his charioteer, Mydon the brave,
 Son of Atymnias, turn'd his steeds to flight,
 Full on his elbow-point Antilochus,
 The son of Nestor, dash'd him with a stone.
 The slack reins, white as ivory,[15] forsook
 His torpid hand and trail'd the dust. At once
 Forth sprang Antilochus, and with his sword
 Hew'd deep his temples. On his head he pitch'd
 Panting, and on his shoulders in the sand
 (For in deep sand he fell) stood long erect,
 Till his own coursers spread him in the dust;
 The son of Nestor seized, and with his scourge
 Drove them afar into the host of Greece.
 Them Hector through the ranks espying, flew
 With clamor loud to meet them; after whom
 Advanced in phalanx firm the powers of Troy,
 Mars led them, with Enyo terror-clad;
 She by the maddening tumult of the fight
 Attended, he, with his enormous spear
 in both hands brandish'd, stalking now in front
 Of Hector, and now following his steps.
 Him Diomede the bold discerning, felt
 Himself no small dismay; and as a man
 Wandering he knows not whither, far from home,
 If chance a rapid torrent to the sea
 Borne headlong thwart his course, the foaming flood
 Obstreperous views awhile, then quick retires,
 So he, and his attendants thus bespake.
 How oft, my countrymen! have we admired
 The noble Hector, skillful at the spear
 And unappall'd in fight? but still hath he
 Some God his guard, and even now I view
 In human form Mars moving at his side.
 Ye, then, with faces to the Trojans turn'd,
 Ceaseless retire, and war not with the Gods.
 He ended; and the Trojans now approach'd.
 Then two bold warriors in one chariot borne,
 By valiant Hector died, Menesthes one,
 And one, Anchialus. Them fallen in fight
 Ajax the vast, touch'd with compassion saw;
 Within small space he stood, his glittering spear
 Dismiss'd, and pierced Amphius. Son was he
 Of Selagus, and P�sus was his home,
 Where opulent he dwelt, but by his fate
 Was led to fight for Priam and his sons.
 Him Telamonian Ajax through his belt
 Wounded, and in his nether bowels deep
 Fix'd his long-shadow'd spear. Sounding he fell.
 Illustrious Ajax running to the slain
 Prepared to strip his arms, but him a shower
 Of glittering-weapons keen from Trojan hands
 Assail'd, and numerous his broad shield received.
 He, on the body planting firm his heel,
 Forth drew the polish'd spear, but his bright arms
 Took not, by darts thick-flying sore annoy'd,
 Nor fear'd he little lest his haughty foes,
 Spear-arm'd and bold, should compass him around;
 Him, therefore, valiant though he were and huge,
 They push'd before them. Staggering he retired.
 Thus toil'd both hosts in that laborious field.
 And now his ruthless destiny impell'd
 Tlepolemus, Alcides' son, a Chief
 Dauntless and huge, against a godlike foe
 Sarpedon. They approaching face to face
 Stood, son and grandson of high-thundering Jove,
 And, haughty, thus Tlepolemus began.
 Sarpedon, leader of the Lycian host,
 Thou trembler! thee what cause could hither urge
 A man unskill'd in arms? They falsely speak
 Who call thee son of �gis-bearing Jove,
 So far below their might thou fall'st who sprang
 From Jove in days of old. What says report
 Of Hercules (for him I boast my sire)
 All-daring hero with a lion's heart?
 With six ships only, and with followers few,
 He for the horses of Laomedon
 Lay'd Troy in dust, and widow'd all her streets.
 But thou art base, and thy diminish'd powers
 Perish around thee; think not that thou earnest
 For Ilium's good, but rather, whatsoe'er
 Thy force in fight, to find, subdued by me,
 A sure dismission to the gates of hell.
 To whom the leader of the Lycian band.
 Tlepolemus! he ransack'd sacred Troy,
 As thou hast said, but for her monarch's fault
 Laomedon, who him with language harsh
 Requited ill for benefits received,
 Nor would the steeds surrender, seeking which
 He voyaged from afar. But thou shalt take
 Thy bloody doom from this victorious arm,
 And, vanquish'd by my spear, shalt yield thy fame
 To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.
 So spake Sarpedon, and his ashen beam
 Tlepolemus upraised. Both hurl'd at once
 Their quivering spears. Sarpedon's through the neck
 Pass'd of Tlepolemus, and show'd beyond
 Its ruthless point; thick darkness veil'd his eyes.
 Tlepolemus with his long lance the thigh
 Pierced of Sarpedon; sheer into his bone
 He pierced him, but Sarpedon's father, Jove,
 Him rescued even on the verge of fate.
 His noble friends conducted from the field
 The godlike Lycian, trailing as he went
 The pendent spear, none thinking to extract
 For his relief the weapon from his thigh,
 Through eagerness of haste to bear him thence.
 On the other side, the Grecians brazen-mail'd
 Bore off Tlepolemus. Ulysses fill'd
 With earnest thoughts tumultuous them observed,
 Danger-defying Chief! Doubtful he stood
 Or to pursue at once the Thunderer's son
 Sarpedon, or to take more Lycian lives.
 But not for brave Ulysses had his fate
 That praise reserved, that he should slay the son
 Renown'd of Jove; therefore his wavering mind
 Minerva bent against the Lycian band.
 Then Coeranus, Alastor, Chromius fell,
 Alcander, Halius, Prytanis, and brave
 No�mon; nor had these sufficed the Chief
 Of Ithaca, but Lycians more had fallen,
 Had not crest-tossing Hector huge perceived
 The havoc; radiant to the van he flew,
 Filling with dread the Grecians; his approach
 Sarpedon, son of Jove, joyful beheld,
 And piteous thus address'd him as he came.
 Ah, leave not me, Priamides! a prey
 To Grecian hands, but in your city, at least,
 Grant me to die: since hither, doom'd, I came
 Never to gratify with my return
 To Lycia, my loved spouse, or infant child.
 He spake; but Hector unreplying pass'd
 Impetuous, ardent to repulse the Greeks
 That moment, and to drench his sword in blood.
 Then, under shelter of a spreading beech
 Sacred to Jove, his noble followers placed
 The godlike Chief Sarpedon, where his friend
 Illustrious Pelagon, the ashen spear
 Extracted. Sightless, of all thought bereft,
 He sank, but soon revived, by breathing airs
 Refresh'd, that fann'd him gently from the North.
 Meantime the Argives, although press'd alike
 By Mars himself and Hector brazen-arm'd,
 Neither to flight inclined, nor yet advanced
 To battle, but inform'd that Mars the fight
 Waged on the side of Ilium, slow retired.[16]
 Whom first, whom last slew then the mighty son
 Of Priam, Hector, and the brazen Mars!
 First godlike Teuthras, an equestrian Chief,
 Orestes, Trechus of �tolian race,
 OEnoma�s, Helenus from OEnops' sprung,
 And brisk[17] in fight Oresbius; rich was he,
 And covetous of more; in Hyla dwelt
 Fast by the lake Cephissus, where abode
 Boeotian Princes numerous, rich themselves
 And rulers of a people wealth-renown'd.
 But Juno, such dread slaughter of the Greeks
 Noting, thus, ardent, to Minerva spake.
 Daughter of Jove invincible! Our word
 That Troy shall perish, hath been given in vain
 To Menelaus, if we suffer Mars
 To ravage longer uncontrol'd. The time
 Urges, and need appears that we ourselves
 Now call to mind the fury of our might.
 She spake; nor blue-eyed Pallas not complied.
 Then Juno, Goddess dread, from Saturn sprung,
 Her coursers gold-caparison'd prepared
 Impatient. Hebe to the chariot roll'd
 The brazen wheels,[18] and joined them to the smooth
 Steel axle; twice four spokes divided each
 Shot from the centre to the verge. The verge
 Was gold by fellies of eternal brass
 Guarded, a dazzling show! The shining naves
 Were silver; silver cords and cords of gold
 The seat upbore; two crescents[19] blazed in front.
 The pole was argent all, to which she bound
 The golden yoke, and in their place disposed
 The breast-bands incorruptible of gold;
 But Juno to the yoke, herself, the steeds
 Led forth, on fire to reach the dreadful field.
 Meantime, Minerva, progeny of Jove,
 On the adamantine floor of his abode
 Let fall profuse her variegated robe,
 Labor of her own hands. She first put on
 The corselet of the cloud-assembler God,
 Then arm'd her for the field of wo complete.
 She charged her shoulder with the dreadful shield
 The shaggy �gis,[20] border'd thick around
 With terror; there was Discord, Prowess there,
 There hot Pursuit, and there the feature grim
 Of Gorgon, dire Deformity, a sign
 Oft borne portentous on the arm of Jove.
 Her golden helm, whose concave had sufficed
 The legions of an hundred cities, rough
 With warlike ornament superb, she fix'd
 On her immortal head. Thus arm'd, she rose
 Into the flaming chariot, and her spear
 Seized ponderous, huge, with which the Goddess sprung
 From an Almighty father, levels ranks
 Of heroes, against whom her anger burns.
 Juno with lifted lash urged quick the steeds;
 At her approach, spontaneous roar'd the wide-
 Unfolding gates of heaven;[21] the heavenly gates
 Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge
 Of the Olympian summit appertains,
 And of the boundless ether, back to roll,
 And to replace the cloudy barrier dense.
 Spurr'd through the portal flew the rapid steeds;
 Apart from all, and seated on the point
 Superior of the cloven mount, they found
 The Thunderer. Juno the white-arm'd her steeds
 There stay'd, and thus the Goddess, ere she pass'd,
 Question'd the son of Saturn, Jove supreme.
 Jove, Father, seest thou, and art not incensed,
 These ravages of Mars? Oh what a field,
 Drench'd with what Grecian blood! All rashly spilt,
 And in despite of me. Venus, the while,
 Sits, and the Archer of the silver bow
 Delighted, and have urged, themselves, to this
 The frantic Mars within no bounds confined
 Of law or order. But, eternal sire!
 Shall I offend thee chasing far away
 Mars deeply smitten from the field of war?
 To whom the cloud-assembler God replied.
 Go! but exhort thou rather to the task
 Spoil-huntress Athen�an Pallas, him
 Accustom'd to chastise with pain severe.
 He spake, nor white-arm'd Juno not obey'd.
 She lash'd her steeds; they readily their flight
 Began, the earth and starry vault between.
 Far as from his high tower the watchman kens
 O'er gloomy ocean, so far at one bound
 Advance the shrill-voiced coursers of the Gods.
 But when at Troy and at the confluent streams
 Of Simo�s and Scamander they arrived,
 There Juno, white-arm'd Goddess, from the yoke
 Her steeds releasing, them in gather'd shades
 Conceal'd opaque, while Simo�s caused to spring
 Ambrosia from his bank, whereon they browsed.
 Swift as her pinions waft the dove away
 They sought the Grecians, ardent to begin:
 Arriving where the mightiest and the most
 Compass'd equestrian Diomede around,
 In aspect lion-like, or like wild boars
 Of matchless force, there white-arm'd Juno stood,
 And in the form of Stentor for his voice
 Of brass renown'd, audible as the roar
 Of fifty throats, the Grecians thus harangued.
 Oh shame, shame, shame! Argives in form alone,
 Beautiful but dishonorable race!
 While yet divine Achilles ranged the field,
 No Trojan stepp'd from yon Dardanian gates
 Abroad; all trembled at his stormy spear;
 But now they venture forth, now at your ships
 Defy you, from their city far remote.
 She ceased, and all caught courage from the sound.
 But Athen�an Pallas eager sought
 The son of Tydeus; at his chariot side
 She found the Chief cooling his fiery wound
 Received from Pandarus; for him the sweat
 Beneath the broad band of his oval shield
 Exhausted, and his arm fail'd him fatigued;
 He therefore raised the band and wiped the blood
 Coagulate; when o'er his chariot yoke
 Her arm the Goddess threw, and thus began.
 Tydeus, in truth, begat a son himself
 Not much resembling. Tydeus was of size
 Diminutive, but had a warrior's heart.
 When him I once commanded to abstain
 From furious fight (what time he enter'd Thebes
 Ambassador, and the Cadmeans found
 Feasting, himself the sole Achaian there)
 And bade him quietly partake the feast.
 He, fired with wonted ardor, challenged forth
 To proof of manhood the Cadmean youth,
 Whom easily, through my effectual aid,
 In contests of each kind he overcame.
 But thou, whom I encircle with my power,
 Guard vigilant, and even bid thee forth
 To combat with the Trojans, thou, thy limbs
 Feel'st wearied with the toils of war, or worse,
 Indulgest womanish and heartless fear.
 Henceforth thou art not worthy to be deem'd
 Son of Oenides, Tydeus famed in arms.
 To whom thus valiant Diomede replied.
 I know thee well, oh Goddess sprung from Jove!
 And therefore willing shall, and plain, reply.
 Me neither weariness nor heartless fear
 Restrains, but thine injunctions which impress
 My memory, still, that I should fear to oppose
 The blessed Gods in fight, Venus except,
 Whom in the battle found thou badest me pierce
 With unrelenting spear; therefore myself
 Retiring hither, I have hither call'd
 The other Argives also, for I know
 That Mars, himself in arms, controls the war.
 Him answer'd then the Goddess azure-eyed.
 Tydides! Diomede, my heart's delight!
 Fear not this Mars,[22] nor fear thou other power
 Immortal, but be confident in me.
 Arise. Drive forth. Seek Mars; him only seek;
 Him hand to hand engage; this fiery Mars
 Respect not aught, base implement of wrong
 And mischief, shifting still from side to side.
 He promised Juno lately and myself
 That he would fight for Greece, yet now forgets
 His promise, and gives all his aid to Troy.
 So saying, she backward by his hand withdrew
 The son of Capaneus, who to the ground
 Leap'd instant; she, impatient to his place
 Ascending, sat beside brave Diomede.
 Loud groan'd the beechen axle, under weight
 Unwonted, for it bore into the fight
 An awful Goddess, and the chief of men.
 Quick-seizing lash and reins Minerva drove
 Direct at Mars. That moment he had slain
 Periphas, bravest of �tolia's sons,
 And huge of bulk; Ochesius was his sire.
 Him Mars the slaughterer had of life bereft
 Newly, and Pallas to elude his sight
 The helmet fixed of Ades on her head.[23]
 Soon as gore-tainted Mars the approach perceived
 Of Diomede, he left the giant length
 Of Periphas extended where he died,
 And flew to cope with Tydeus' valiant son.
 Full nigh they came, when Mars on fire to slay
 The hero, foremost with his brazen lance
 Assail'd him, hurling o'er his horses' heads.
 But Athen�an Pallas in her hand
 The flying weapon caught and turn'd it wide,
 Baffling his aim. Then Diomede on him
 Rush'd furious in his turn, and Pallas plunged
 The bright spear deep into his cinctured waist
 Dire was the wound, and plucking back the spear
 She tore him. Bellow'd brazen-throated Mars
 Loud as nine thousand warriors, or as ten
 Join'd in close combat. Grecians, Trojans shook
 Appall'd alike at the tremendous voice
 Of Mars insatiable with deeds of blood.
 Such as the dimness is when summer winds
 Breathe hot, and sultry mist obscures the sky,
 Such brazen Mars to Diomede appear'd
 By clouds accompanied in his ascent
 Into the boundless ether. Reaching soon
 The Olympian heights, seat of the Gods, he sat
 Beside Saturnian Jove; wo fill'd his heart;
 He show'd fast-streaming from the wound his blood
 Immortal, and impatient thus complain'd.
 Jove, Father! Seest thou these outrageous acts
 Unmoved with anger? Such are day by day
 The dreadful mischiefs by the Gods contrived
 Against each other, for the sake of man.
 Thou art thyself the cause. Thou hast produced
 A foolish daughter petulant, addict
 To evil only and injurious deeds;
 There is not in Olympus, save herself,
 Who feels not thy control; but she her will
 Gratifies ever, and reproof from thee
 Finds none, because, pernicious as she is,
 She is thy daughter. She hath now the mind
 Of haughty Diomede with madness fill'd
 Against the immortal Gods; first Venus bled;
 Her hand he pierced impetuous, then assail'd,
 As if himself immortal, even me,
 But me my feet stole thence, or overwhelm'd
 Beneath yon heaps of carcases impure,
 What had I not sustain'd? And if at last
 I lived, had halted crippled by the sword.
 To whom with dark displeasure Jove replied.
 Base and side-shifting traitor! vex not me
 Here sitting querulous; of all who dwell
 On the Olympian heights, thee most I hate
 Contentious, whose delight is war alone.
 Thou hast thy mother's moods, the very spleen
 Of Juno, uncontrolable as she.
 Whom even I, reprove her as I may,
 Scarce rule by mere commands; I therefore judge
 Thy sufferings a contrivance all her own.
 But soft. Thou art my son whom I begat.
 And Juno bare thee. I can not endure
 That thou shouldst suffer long. Hadst thou been born
 Of other parents thus detestable,
 What Deity soe'er had brought thee forth,
 Thou shouldst have found long since a humbler sphere.
 He ceased, and to the care his son consign'd
 Of P�on; he with drugs of lenient powers,
 Soon heal'd whom immortality secured
 From dissolution. As the juice from figs
 Express'd what fluid was in milk before
 Coagulates, stirr'd rapidly around,
 So soon was Mars by P�on skill restored.
 Him Hebe bathed, and with divine attire
 Graceful adorn'd; when at the side of Jove
 Again his glorious seat sublime he took.
 Meantime to the abode of Jove supreme
 Ascended Juno throughout Argos known
 And mighty Pallas; Mars the plague of man,
 By their successful force from slaughter driven.
