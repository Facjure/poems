 O the night was dark and the night was late,
And the robbers came to rob him;
 And they picked the locks of his palace-gate,
The robbers that came to rob him - 
 They picked the locks of his palace-gate,
 Seized his jewels and gems of state,
 His coffers of gold and his priceless plate, - 
The robbers that came to rob him.

 But loud laughed he in the morning red! - 
For of what had the robbers robbed him? - 
 Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,
When the robbers came to rob him, - 
 They robbed him not of a golden shred
 Of the childish dreams in his wise old head - 
 "And they're welcome to all things else," he said,
When the robbers came to rob him.
