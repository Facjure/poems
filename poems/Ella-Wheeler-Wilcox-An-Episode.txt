Along the narrow Moorish street
 A blue-eyed soldier strode.
(Ah, well-a-day)
Veiled from her lashes to her feet
 She stepped from her abode,
(Ah, lack-a-day).

Now love may guard a favoured wife
 Who leaves the harem door;
(Ah, well-a-day)
But hungry hearted is her life
 When she is one of four.
(Ah, lack-a-day.)

If black eyes glow with sudden fire
 And meet warm eyes of blue - 
(Ah, well-a-day).
The old, old story of desire
 Repeats itself anew.
(Ah, lack-a-day.)

When bugles blow the soldier flies - 
 Though bitter tears may fall
(Ah, lack-a-day).
A MOORISH CHILD WITH BLUE, BLUE EYES
 PLAYS IN THE HAREM HALL.
(Ah, well-a-day.)
