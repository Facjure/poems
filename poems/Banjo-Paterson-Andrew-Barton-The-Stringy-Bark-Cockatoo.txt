title: The Stringy-Bark Cockatoo
---

I�m a broken-hearted miner, who loves his cup to drain,
Which often times has caused me to lie in frost and rain.
Roaming about the country, looking for some work to do,
I got a job of reaping off a stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus

 Oh, the stringy-bark cockatoo,
 Oh, the stringy-bark cockatoo,
 I got a job of reaping off a stringy-bark cockatoo.

Ten bob an acre was his price�with promise of fairish board.
He said his crops were very light, �twas all he could afford.
He drove me out in a bullock dray, and his piggery met my view.
Oh, the pigs and geese were in the wheat of the stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus: Oh, the stringy-bark, &amp;c.

The hut was made of the surface mud, the roof of a reedy thatch.
The doors and windows open flew without a bolt or latch.
The pigs and geese were in the hut, the hen on the table flew,
And she laid an egg in the old tin plate for the stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus: Oh, the stringy-bark, &amp;c.

For breakfast we had pollard, boys, it tasted like cobbler�s paste.
To help it down we had to eat brown bread with vinegar taste.
The tea was made of the native hops, which out on the ranges grew;
�Twas sweetened with honey bees and wax for the stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus: Oh, the stringy-bark, &amp;c.

For dinner we had goanna hash, we thought it mighty hard;
They wouldn�t give us butter, so we forced down bread and lard.
Quondong duff, paddy-melon pie, and wallaby Irish stew
We used to eat while reaping for the stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus: Oh, the stringy-bark, &amp;c.

When we started to cut the rust and smut was just beginning to shed,
And all we had to sleep on was a dog and sheep-skin bed.
The bugs and fleas tormented me, they made me scratch and screw;
I lost my rest while reaping for the stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus: Oh, the stringy-bark, &amp;c.

At night when work was over I�d nurse the youngest child,
And when I�d say a joking word, the mother would laugh and smile.
The old cocky, he grew jealous, and he thumped me black and blue,
And he drove me off without a rap�the stringy-bark cockatoo.

 Chorus: Oh, the stringy-bark, &amp;c.
