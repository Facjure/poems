title: Good And Bad Luck. Translations. After Heine.
---

Good luck is the gayest of all gay girls,
Long in one place she will not stay;
Back from your brow she strokes the curls,
Kisses you quick and flies away.

But Madame Bad Luck soberly comes
And stays, - no fancy has she for flitting, -
Snatches of true love-songs she hums,
And sits by your bed, and brings her knitting.
