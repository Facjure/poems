[He travels southward, and looks around;]
I journeyed from my native spot
 Across the south sea shine,
And found that people in hall and cot
Laboured and suffered each his lot
 Even as I did mine.

[and cannot discern the boundary]
Thus noting them in meads and marts
 It did not seem to me
That my dear country with its hearts,
Minds, yearnings, worse and better parts
 Had ended with the sea.

[of his native country;]
I further and further went anon,
 As such I still surveyed,
And further yet - yea, on and on,
And all the men I looked upon
 Had heart-strings fellow-made.

[or where his duties to his fellow-creatures end;]
I traced the whole terrestrial round,
 Homing the other side;
Then said I, "What is there to bound
My denizenship? It seems I have found
 Its scope to be world-wide."

[nor who are his enemies]
I asked me: "Whom have I to fight,
 And whom have I to dare,
And whom to weaken, crush, and blight?
My country seems to have kept in sight
 On my way everywhere."

1913.
