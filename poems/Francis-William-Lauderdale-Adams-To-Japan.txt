 Simple you were, and good. No kindlier heart
Beat than the heart within your gentle breast.
Labour you had, and happiness, and rest,
 And were the maid of nations. Now you start
 To feverish life, feeling the poisonous smart
Upon your lips of harlot lips close-pressed,
The lips of her who stands among the rest
 With greasy righteous soul and rotten heart.
 O sunrise land, O land of gentleness,
What madness drives you to lust's dreadful bed?
 O thrice accursed England, wretchedness
For ever be on you, of whom 'tis said,
 Prostitute plague-struck, that you catch and kiss
Innocent lives to make them foully dead!
