Ah, fair Lord God of Heaven, to whom we call, -
 By whom we live, - on whom our hopes are built, -
 Do Thou, from year to year, e'en as Thou wilt,
Control the Realm, but suffer not to fall
Its ancient faith, its grandeur, and its thrall!
 Do Thou preserve it, in the hours of guilt,
 When foemen thirst for blood that should be spilt,
And keep it strong when traitors would appal.
Uphold us still, O God! and be the screen
 And sword and buckler of our England's might,
That foemen's wiles, and woes which intervene,
 May fade away, as fades a winter's night.
Thine ears have heard us, and Thine eyes have seen.
 Wilt Thou not help us, Lord! to find the Light?
