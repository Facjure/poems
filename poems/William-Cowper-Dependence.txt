To keep the lamp alive,
With oil we fill the bowl;
�Tis water makes the willow thrive,
And grace that feeds the soul.


The Lord�s unsparing hand
Supplies the living stream;
It is not at our own command,
But still derived from him.


Beware of Peter�s word,[1]
Nor confidently say,
�I never will deny thee, Lord,�
But, �Grant I never may!�


Man�s wisdom is to seek
His strength in God alone;
And e�en an angel would be weak,
Who trusted in his own.


Retreat beneath his wings,
And in his grace confide;
This more exalts the King of kings[2]
Than all your works beside.


In Jesus is our store,
Grace issues from his throne;
Whoever says, �I want no more,�
Confesses he has none.
