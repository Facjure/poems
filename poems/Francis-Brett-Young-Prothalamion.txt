When the evening came my love said to me:
 Let us go into the garden now that the sky is cool;
The garden of black hellebore and rosemary,
 Where wild woodruff spills in a milky pool.

Low we passed in the twilight, for the wavering heat
 Of day had waned; and round that shaded plot
Of secret beauty the thickets clustered sweet:
 Here is heaven, our hearts whispered, but our lips spake not.

Between that old garden and seas of lazy foam
 Gloomy and beautiful alleys of trees arise
With spire of cypress and dreamy beechen dome,
 So dark that our enchanted sight knew nothing but the skies:

Veiled with a soft air, drench'd in the roses' musk
 Or the dusky, dark carnation's breath of clove:
No stars burned in their deeps, but through the dusk
 I saw my love's eyes, and they were brimmed with love.

No star their secret ravished, no wasting moon
 Mocked the sad transience of those eternal hours:
Only the soft, unseeing heaven of June,
 The ghosts of great trees, and the sleeping flowers.

For doves that crooned in the leafy noonday now
 Were silent; the night-jar sought his secret covers,
Nor even a mild sea-whisper moved a creaking bough -
 Was ever a silence deeper made for lovers?

Was ever a moment meeter made for love?
 Beautiful are your closed lips beneath my kiss;
And all your yielding sweetness beautiful -
 Oh, never in all the world was such a night as this!
