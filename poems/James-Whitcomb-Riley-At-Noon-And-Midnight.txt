title: At Noon - And Midnight.
---

 Far in the night, and yet no rest for him! The pillow next his own
 The wife's sweet face in slumber pressed - yet he awake - alone! alone!
 In vain he courted sleep; - one thought would ever in his heart arise, -
 The harsh words that at noon had brought the teardrops to her eyes.

 Slowly on lifted arm he raised and listened. All was still as death;
 He touched her forehead as he gazed, and listened yet, with bated breath:
 Still silently, as though he prayed, his lips moved lightly as she slept -
 For God was with him, and he laid his face with hers and wept.
