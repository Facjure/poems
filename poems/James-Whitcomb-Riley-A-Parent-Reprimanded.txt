 Sometimes I think 'at Parents does
 Things ist about as bad as us - 


Wite 'fore our vurry eyes, at that!
 Fer one time Pa he scold' my Ma
'Cause he can't find his hat;
 An' she ist cried, she did! An' I
Says, "Ef you scold my Ma
 Ever again an' make her cry,
Wy, you sha'n't be my Pa!"
 An' nen he laugh' an' find his hat
 Ist wite where Ma she said it's at!
