"At the Sign of the Lyre,"
Good Folk, we present you
With the pick of our quire,
And we hope to content you!

Here be Ballad and Song,
The fruits of our leisure,
Some short and some long--
May they all give you pleasure!

But if, when you read,
They should fail to restore you,
Farewell, and God-speed--
The world is before you!
