[FOR A BIRTHDAY: MAY 20]


On this day to life she came - 
May-Rose, my May-Rose!
With scented breeze, with flowered flame,
She touched the earth and took her name
Of May, Rose.

Here, to-day, she grows and flowers - 
May-Rose, my May-Rose.
All my life with light she dowers,
And colors all the coming hours
With May, Rose!
