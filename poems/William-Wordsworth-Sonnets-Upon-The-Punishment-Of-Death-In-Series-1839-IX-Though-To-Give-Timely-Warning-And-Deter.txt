title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 - IX - Though To Give Timely Warning And Deter
---

 Though to give timely warning and deter
 Is one great aim of penalty, extend
 Thy mental vision further and ascend
 Far higher, else full surely shalt thou err.
 What is a State? The wise behold in her
 A creature born of time, that keeps one eye
 Fixed on the statutes of Eternity,
 To which her judgments reverently defer.
 Speaking through Law's dispassionate voice the State
 Endues her conscience with external life
 And being, to preclude or quell the strife
 Of individual will, to elevate
 The groveling mind, the erring to recall,
 And fortify the moral sense of all.
