We were two lovers; let me lie by her,
My tomb beside her tomb. On hers inscribe,
�I loved him; but my reason bade prefer
Duty to love, reject the tempter�s bribe
Of rose and lily when each path diverged,
And either I must pace to life�s far end
As love should lead me, or, as duty urged,
Plod the worn causeway arm-in-arm with friend.
So, truth turned falsehood: �How I loathe a flower,
How prize the pavement!� still caressed his ear,
The deafish friend�s, through life�s day, hour by hour,
As he laughed (coughing). �Ay, it would appear!�
But deep within my heart of hearts there hid
Ever the confidence, amends for all,
That heaven repairs what wrong earth�s journey did,
When love from life-long exile comes at call.
Duty and love, one broad way, were the best,
Who doubts? But one or other was to choose,
I chose the darkling half, and wait the rest
In that new world where light and darkness fuse.�

Inscribe on mine, �I loved her: love�s track lay
O�er sand and pebble, as all travellers know.
Duty led through a smiling country, gay
With greensward where the rose and lily blow.
�Our roads are diverse: farewell, love!� said she:
��Tis duty I abide by: homely sward
And not the rock-rough picturesque for me!
Above, where both roads join, I wait reward.
Be you as constant to the path whereon
I leave you planted!� But man needs must move,
Keep moving, whither, when the star is gone
Whereby he steps secure nor strays from love?
No stone but I was tripped by, stumbling-block
But brought me to confusion. Where I fell,
There I lay flat, if moss disguised the rock,
Thence, if flint pierced, I rose and cried �All�s well!
Duty be mine to tread in that high sphere
Where love from duty ne�er disparts, I trust,
And two halves make that whole, whereof, since here
One must sufice a man, why, this one must!�

Inscribe each tomb thus: then, some sage acquaint
The simple, which holds sinner, which holds saint!
