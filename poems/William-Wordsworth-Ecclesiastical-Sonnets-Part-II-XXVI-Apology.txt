 Not utterly unworthy to endure
 Was the supremacy of crafty Rome;
 Age after age to the arch of Christendom
 Aerial keystone haughtily secure;
 Supremacy from Heaven transmitted pure,
 As many hold; and, therefore, to the tomb
 Pass, some through fire and by the scaffold some
 Like saintly Fisher, and unbending More.
 "Lightly for both the bosom's lord did sit
 "Upon his throne;" unsoftened, undismayed
 By aught that mingled with the tragic scene
 Of pity or fear: and More's gay genius played
 With the inoffensive sword of native wit,
 Than the bare axe more luminous and keen.
