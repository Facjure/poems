Silent, the Lord of the world
Eyes from the heavenly height,
Girt by his far-shining train,
Us, who with banners unfurl�d
Fight life�s many-chanc�d fight
Madly below, in the plain.

Then saith the Lord to his own:
�See ye the battle below?
Turmoil of death and of birth!
Too long let we them groan.
Haste, arise ye, and go;
Carry my peace upon earth.�

Gladly they rise at his call;
Gladly they take his command;
Gladly descend to the plain.
Alas! How few of them all,
Those willing servants, shall stand
In their Master�s presence again!

Some in the tumult are lost
Baffled, bewilder�d, they stray.
Some as prisoners draw breath.
Others, the bravest, are cross�d,
On the height of their bold-follow�d way,
By the swift-rushing missile of Death.

Hardly, hardly shall one
Come, with countenance bright,
O�er the cloud-wrapt, perilous plain:
His Master�s errand well done,
Safe through the smoke of the fight,
Back to his Master again.
