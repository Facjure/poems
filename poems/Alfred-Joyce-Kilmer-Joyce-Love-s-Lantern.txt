(For Aline)



 Because the road was steep and long
And through a dark and lonely land,
 God set upon my lips a song
And put a lantern in my hand.

 Through miles on weary miles of night
That stretch relentless in my way
 My lantern burns serene and white,
An unexhausted cup of day.

 O golden lights and lights like wine,
How dim your boasted splendors are.
 Behold this little lamp of mine;
It is more starlike than a star!
