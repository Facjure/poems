"I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety"


The tranquil hours steal by
On drowsy wings and slow,
And over all the peaceful sky
The stars of evening glow.

No gathering clouds I see,
I hear no rising blast,
I fold my tired hands restfully,
As though all storms were past.

Yet, whether so or not,
O Lord, thou knowest best!
This night, let every anxious thought
And trembling fear have rest

This night I will lie down
In peace beneath thine eye,
Nor heed what ills unseen may frown,
Since thou art ever nigh.

I will lie down and sleep,
From every terror free;
Nor wake to tremble or to weep,
Secure, O Lord, with thee!
