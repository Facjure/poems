 The lark's in the sky, love,
 The flowers on the lea,
 The whitethorn's in bloom, love,
 To please thee and me;
 'Neath its shade we can rest, love,
 And sit on the hill,
 And as last we met, love,
 Enjoy the Spring still.

 The Spring is for lovers,
 The Spring is for joy:
 O'er the moor, where the plovers
 Whirr, startled, and cry,
 We'll seek the white hawthorn, love,
 And sit on the hill;
 In the sweet sunny morn, love,
 We'll be lovers still;

 Where the partridge is craking
 From morning to e'en,
 In the wheat lands awaking,
 The sprouts young and green,
 Where the brook dribbles past, love,
 Down the willowy glen,
 And as we met last, love,
 Be lovers again.

 The lark's in the grass, love,
 A-building her nest;
 And the brook's running fast, love,
 'Neath the carrion-crow's nest:
 There the wild woodbines twine, love;
 And, till the day's gone,
 Sun's set, and stars shine, love,
 I'll call thee my own.
