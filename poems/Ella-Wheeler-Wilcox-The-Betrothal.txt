There was a little pause between the dances;
 Without, somewhere, a tinkling fountain played.
The dusky path was lit by ardent glances
 As forth they fared, a lover and a maid.
He chose a nook, from curious eyes well hidden - 
 All redolent with sweet midsummer charm,
And by the great primeval instinct bidden,
 He drew her in the shelter of his arm.
The words that long deep in his heart had trembled
Found sudden utterance; she at first dissembled,
 Refused her lips, and half withdrew her hand,
Then murmured "Yes," and yielded, woman fashion,
Her virgin mouth to young love's kiss of passion.
