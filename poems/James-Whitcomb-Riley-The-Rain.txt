I.

 The rain! the rain! the rain!
It gushed from the skies and streamed
 Like awful tears; and the sick man thought
How pitiful it seemed!
 And he turned his face away,
And stared at the wall again,
 His hopes nigh dead and his heart worn out.
O the rain! the rain! the rain!



II.

 The rain! the rain! the rain!
And the broad stream brimmed the shores;
 And ever the river crept over the reeds
And the roots of the sycamores:
 A corpse swirled by in a drift
Where the boat had snapt its chain -
 And a hoarse-voiced mother shrieked and raved.
O the rain! the rain! the rain!



III.

 The rain! the rain! the rain! -
Pouring, with never a pause,
 Over the fields and the green byways -
How beautiful it was!
 And the new-made man and wife
Stood at the window-pane
 Like two glad children kept from school. -
O the rain! the rain! the rain!
