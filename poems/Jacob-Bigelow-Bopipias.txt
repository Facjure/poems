	 Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep,
	 And couldn�t tell where to find �em.
	 Let �em alone, and they�ll come home,
	 And bring their tails behind �em.

	Parvula Bopipias amissos qu�ritat agnos,
	 Nec reperire locum quo latu�re potest.
	Desine, Bopipias, redeuntes nocte videbis,
	 Caudasque incolumes post sua crura ferent.
