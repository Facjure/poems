title: In The Downhill Of Life
---

In the downhill of life, when I find I�m declining,
May my lot no less fortunate be
Than a snug elbow-chair can afford for reclining,
And a cot that o�erlooks the wide sea;
With an ambling pad-pony to pace o�er the lawn,
While I carol away idle sorrow,
And blithe as the lark that each day hails the dawn
Look forward with hope for tomorrow.

With a porch at my door, both for shelter and shade too,
As the sunshine or rain may prevail;
And a small spot of ground for the use of the spade too,
With a barn for the use of the flail;
A cow for my dairy, a dog for my game,
And a purse when a friend wants to borrow;
I�ll envy no Nabob his riches or fame,
Nor what honours may wait him tomorrow.

From the bleak northern blast may my cot be completely
Secured by a neighbouring hill;
And at night may repose steal upon me more sweetly
By the sound of a murmuring rill;
And while peace and plenty I find at my board,
With a heart free from sickness and sorrow,
With my friends may I share what today may afford,
And let them spread the table tomorrow.

And when I at last must throw off this frail cov�ring
Which I�ve worn for threescore years and ten,
On the brink of the grave I�ll not seek to keep hov�ring,
Nor my thread wish to spin o�er again;
But my face in the glass I�ll serenely survey,
And with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow;
As this old worn-out stuff, which is threadbare today,
May become everlasting tomorrow.
