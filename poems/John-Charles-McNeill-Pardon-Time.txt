 Give over now; forbear.The moonlight steeps
 In silver silence towered castle-keeps
And cottage crofts, where apples bend the bough.
 Peace guards us round, and many a tired heart sleeps.
Let me brush back the shadow from your brow.
Give over now.

 On such a night, how sweet, how sweet is life,
 Even to the insect piper with his fife!
And must your troubled face still bear the blight
 Of strength that runs itself to waste in strife?
For love's own heart should throb through all the light
Of such a night.
