As fleecy clouds trail back across the skies,
 Showing the sweet young moon in azure space,
 The lifted veil revealed her shining face - 
A sudden wonder to his eager eyes.
In that familiar beauty lurked surprise:
 For now the wife stood in the maiden's place - 
 With conscious dignity, and woman's grace,
And love's large pride grown trebly fair and wise.

The world receded, leaving them alone.
 The universe was theirs, from sphere to sphere,
And life assumed new meaning, and new worth.
Love held no privilege they did not own,
 And when they kissed each other without fear,
They understood why God had made the earth.
