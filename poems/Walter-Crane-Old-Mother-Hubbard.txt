Old Mother Hubbard
Went to the cupboard
To get her poor Dog a bone;
But when she came there
The cupboard was bare,
And so the poor Dog had none.

She went to the baker's
To buy him some bread,
But when she came back,
The poor Dog was dead.

She went to the joiner's
To buy him a coffin,
But when she came back,
The poor Dog was laughing.

She took a clean dish
To get him some tripe,
But when she came back,
He was smoking a pipe.

She went to the ale-house
To get him some beer,
But when she came back,
The Dog sat in a chair.

She went to the tavern
For white wine and red,
But when she came back,
The Dog stood on his head.

She went to the hatter's,
To buy him a hat,
But when she came back,
He was feeding the cat.

She went to the barber's
To buy him a wig,
But when she came back,
He was dancing a jig.

She went to the fruiterer's
To buy him some fruit,
But when she came back,
He was playing the flute.

She went to the tailor's
To buy him a coat,
But when she came back,
He was riding a goat.

She went to the cobbler's
To buy him some shoes,
But when she came back,
He was reading the news.

She went to the sempstress
To buy him some linen,
But when she came back,
The Dog was a-spinning.

She went to the hosier's
To buy him some hose,
But when she came back,
He was drest in his clothes.

The Dame made a curtsey,
The Dog made a bow;
The Dame said, "Your servant,"
The Dog said, "Bow wow!"

This wonderful Dog
Was Dame Hubbard's delight,
He could sing, he could dance.
He could read, he could write.

She gave him rich dainties
Whenever he fed,
And erected a monument
When he was dead.
