 "Yes, I used always to think
That you Russians knew
 How to make the good drink
As none others do.

 "And I thought moreover,
(Not with the epicures),
 You might search the world over
For such women as yours.

 "In both these matters now
I perceive I was right,
 And I really can't tell you how
Much I delight

 "In my third (Thanks, another cup!)
Idea of the fun,
 When your country gets up
And follows the sun!

 "And just as in Europe, see,
There's a conqueror nation,
 So why not in Asia be
A like jubilation?

 "Taught as well as organized, {69b}
The eternal Coolie,
 From being robbed and despised,
Takes to cutting throats duly!

 "But - please, don't be flurried;
For I daresay by then
 You'll be comfortably buried,
Ladies and gentlemen!

 "No more, thanks! I must be going!
I'm so glad to have made this
 Opportunity of knowing
Some more Russian ladies!"
