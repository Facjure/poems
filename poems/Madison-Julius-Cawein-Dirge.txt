 What shall her silence keep
 Under the sun?
 Here, where the willows weep
 And waters run;
 Here, where she lies asleep,
 And all is done.

 Lights, when the tree-top swings;
 Scents that are sown;
 Sounds of the wood-bird's wings;
 And the bee's drone:
 These be her comfortings
 Under the stone.

 What shall watch o'er her here
 When day is fled?
 Here, when the night is near
 And skies are red;
 Here, where she lieth dear
 And young and dead.

 Shadows, and winds that spill
 Dew; and the tune
 Of the wild whippoorwill;
 And the white moon;
 These be the watchers still
 Over her stone.
