title: Pleasant Prophecies

A day of gladness yet will dawn,
 Though when I cannot say;
Perhaps it may be Thursday week,
 Perhaps some other day,--

When man, freed from the bond of clothes,
 And needing no more food,
Shall never pull his neighbour's nose,
 But be extremely good.

When Love and Nobleness shall live
 Next door to Truth and Right,
While Reverence shall rent a room,
 Upon the second flight.

 And wishes shall be horses then,
 And beggars shall be kings;
And all the people shall admire
 This pleasant state of things.

But if it seems a mystery,
 And you're inclined to doubt it,
Just ask your local poet.He
 Will tell you all about it.
