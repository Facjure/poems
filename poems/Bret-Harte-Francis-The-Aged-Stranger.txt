�I was with Grant� the stranger said;
Said the farmer, �Say no more,
But rest thee here at my cottage porch,
For thy feet are weary and sore.�

�I was with Grant� the stranger said;
Said the farmer, �Nay, no more,
I prithee sit at my frugal board,
And eat of my humble store.

�How fares my boy, my soldier boy,
Of the old Ninth Army Corps?
I warrant he bore him gallantly
In the smoke and the battle�s roar!�

�I know him not,� said the aged man,
�And, as I remarked before,
I was with Grant� �Nay, nay, I know,�
Said the farmer, �say no more:

�He fell in battle, I see, alas!
Thou�dst smooth these tidings o�er,
Nay, speak the truth, whatever it be,
Though it rend my bosom�s core.

�How fell he?With his face to the foe,
Upholding the flag he bore?
Oh, say not that my boy disgraced
The uniform that he wore!�

�I cannot tell,� said the aged man,
�And should have remarked before.
That I was with Grant, in Illinois,
Some three years before the war.�

Then the farmer spake him never a word,
But beat with his fist full sore
That aged man who had worked for Grant
Some three years before the war.
