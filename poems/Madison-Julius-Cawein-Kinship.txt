I.

 There is no flower of wood or lea,
 No April flower, as fair as she:
 O white anemone, who hast
 The wind's wild grace,
 Know her a cousin of thy race,
 Into whose face
 A presence like the wind's hath passed.


II.

 There is no flower of wood or lea,
 No Maytime flower, as fair as she:
 O bluebell, tender with the blue
 Of limpid skies,
 Thy lineage hath kindred ties
 In her, whose eyes
 The heav'n's own qualities imbue.


III.

 There is no flower of wood or lea,
 No Juneday flower, as fair as she:
 Rose, odorous with beauty of
 Life's first and best, 
 Behold thy sister here confessed!
 Whose maiden breast
 Is fragrant with the dreams of love.
