title: Hail, Risen Lord!
---

Hail, risen Lord, upon whose brow
The crown of victory resteth now,
Unfading as the sun!
Hail, vanquisher of every foe,
Of Sin, dread source of all our woe,
And Death - the last undone!

Hail, risen Lord, - the empty grave
Proclaims aloud thy power to save, - 
Thy high, victorious might!
Hail, Lord of life, and peace, and love,
On thy exalted throne above,
In uncreated light!

Hail, risen Lord, - we bend the knee,
And lift the adoring eye to thee,
And yield thee worship meet! - 
And, while the angelic hosts on high
Shout their hosannas through the sky,
We breathe them at thy feet

For here, 'mid darkness, sin, and death,
Our loudest praise is but a breath, - 
An infant's feeble sigh!
Yet, haply, to thy gracious ear
Our weak hosannas are as dear,
As those that swell on high!

Hail, risen Lord, - exalted King,
Well may the highest heavens ring
With rapture's sweetest lays!
Be ours to add our feeble sigh
To the full chorus of the sky,
In reverential praise!
