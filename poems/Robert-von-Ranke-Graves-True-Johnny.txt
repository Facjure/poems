 Johnny, sweetheart, can you be true
 To all those famous vows you've made,
 Will you love me as I love you
 Until we both in earth are laid?
 Or shall the old wives nod and say
 His love was only for a day:
 The mood goes by,
 His fancies fly,
 And Mary's left to sigh.

 Mary, alas, you've hit the truth,
 And I with grief can but admit
 Hot-blooded haste controls my youth,
 My idle fancies veer and flit
 From flower to flower, from tree to tree,
 And when the moment catches me,
 Oh, love goes by
 Away I fly
 And leave my girl to sigh.

 Could you but now foretell the day,
 Johnny, when this sad thing must be,
 When light and gay you'll turn away
 And laugh and break the heart in me?
 For like a nut for true love's sake
 My empty heart shall crack and break,
 When fancies fly
 And love goes by
 And Mary's left to die.

 When the sun turns against the clock,
 When Avon waters upward flow,
 When eggs are laid by barn-door cock,
 When dusty hens do strut and crow,
 When up is down, when left is right,
 Oh, then I'll break the troth I plight,
 With careless eye
 Away I'll fly
 And Mary here shall die.
