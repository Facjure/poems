 'A fagot, a fagot, go fetch for the fire, son!'
'O, Mother, the wolf looks in at the door!'
 'Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! thou fierce grey wolf fly, now;
Haste thee away, he will fright thee no more.'

 'I ran, O, I ran, but the grey wolf ran faster,
O, Mother, I cry in the air at thy door,
 Cry Shoo! now, cry Shoo! but his fangs were so cruel,
Thy son (save his hatchet) thou'lt never see more.'
