[1]

 A little fish will grow,
 If life be spared, a great;
 But yet to let him go,
 And for his growing wait,
 May not be very wise,
 As 'tis not sure your bait
 Will catch him when of size.
 Upon a river bank, a fisher took
 A tiny troutling from his hook.
 Said he, ''Twill serve to count, at least,
 As the beginning of my feast;
 And so I'll put it with the rest.'
 This little fish, thus caught,
 His clemency besought.
 'What will your honour do with me?
 I'm not a mouthful, as you see.
 Pray let me grow to be a trout,
 And then come here and fish me out.
 Some alderman, who likes things nice,
 Will buy me then at any price.
 But now, a hundred such you'll have to fish,
 To make a single good-for-nothing dish.'
 'Well, well, be it so,' replied the fisher,
 'My little fish, who play the preacher,
 The frying-pan must be your lot,
 Although, no doubt, you like it not:
 I fry the fry that can be got.'

 In some things, men of sense
 Prefer the present to the future tense.
