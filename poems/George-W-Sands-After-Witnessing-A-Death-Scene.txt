title: After Witnessing A Death-Scene.
---


 Press close your lips,
 And bow your heads to earth, for Death is here!
 Mark ye not how across that eye so clear,
 Steals his eclipse?

 A moment more,
 And the quick throbbings of her heart shall cease,
 Her pain-wrung spirit will obtain release,
 And all be o'er!

 Hush! Seal ye up
 Your gushing tears, for Mercy's hand hath shaken
 Her earth-bonds off, and from her lip hath taken
 Grief's bitter cup.

 Ye know the dead
 Are they who rest secure from care and strife, - 
 That they who walk the thorny way of life,
 Have tears to shed.

 Ye know her pray'r,
 Was for the quiet of the tomb's deep rest, - 
 Love's sepulchre lay cold within her breast,
 Could peace dwell there?

 A tale soon told,
 Is of her life the story; she had loved,
 And he who won her heart to love, had proved
 Heartless and cold.

 Lay her to rest,
 Where shines and falls the summer's sun and dew;
 For these should shine and fall where lies so true
 And fond a breast!

 A full release
 From every pang is given to the dead, - 
 So on the stone ye place above her head,
 Write only "Peace."*

 When Spring comes back,
 With music on her lips, - joy in her eye, - 
 Her sunny banner streaming through the sky, - 
 Flow'rs in her track - 

 Then come ye here,
 And musing from the busy world apart,
 Drop on the turf that wraps her mouldering heart,
 Sweet Pity's tear.
