title: And Then Some
---

The anger past
as a cat arches her back
a thickly rich robust anger
blackest coffee in a thick
earthen mug
this thug &amp; mugger with sufficient
silk thread.

Yet the assassin is back
with catcalls &amp; hiss
cortisol adrenalin that
lunge like that cat
rapid-fire along the back garden fence
this patio stroll
my senses black.

And time luxuriating like a thick veil.

That dread pack with
anger in the lead
 - what prevokes it - 
obviously really
a pack of violent
running lies - wolves
hell-bent running over
intent on deceit,
thievery, then some.

A narrative with a long reach.
