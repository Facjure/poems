"See this my garden,
Large and fair!"
--Thus, to his friend,
The Philosopher.

"'Tis not too long,"
His friend replied,
With truth exact,--
"Nor yet too wide.
But well compact,
If somewhat cramped
On every side."

Quick the reply--
"But see how high!--
It reaches up
To God's blue sky!"

Not by their size
Measure we men
Or things.
Wisdom, with eyes
Washed in the fire,
Seeketh the things
That are higher--
Things that have wings,
Thoughts that aspire.
