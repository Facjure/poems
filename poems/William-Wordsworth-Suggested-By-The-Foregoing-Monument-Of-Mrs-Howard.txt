 Tranquility! the sovereign aim wert thou
 In heathen schools of philosophic lore;
 Heart-stricken by stern destiny of yore
 The Tragic Muse thee served with thoughtful vow;
 And what of hope Elysium could allow
 Was fondly seized by Sculpture, to restore
 Peace to the Mourner. But when He who wore
 The crown of thorns around his bleeding brow
 Warmed our sad being with celestial light,
 'Then' Arts which still had drawn a softening grace
 From shadowy fountains of the Infinite,
 Communed with that Idea face to face:
 And move around it now as planets run,
 Each in its orbit round the central Sun.
