title: As By Fire.

 Sometimes I feel so passionate a yearning
 For spiritual perfection here below,
 This vigorous frame, with healthful fervor burning,
 Seems my determined foe,

 So actively it makes a stern resistance,
 So cruelly sometimes it wages war
 Against a wholly spiritual existence
 Which I am striving for.

 It interrupts my soul's intense devotions;
 Some hope it strangles, of divinest birth,
 With a swift rush of violent emotions
 Which link me to the earth.

 It is as if two mortal foes contended
 Within my bosom in a deadly strife,
 One for the loftier aims for souls intended,
 One for the earthly life.

 And yet I know this very war within me,
 Which brings out all my will-power and control,
 This very conflict at the last shall win me
 The loved and longed-for goal.

 The very fire which seems sometimes so cruel
 Is the white light that shows me my own strength.
 A furnace, fed by the divinest fuel,
 It may become at length.

 Ah! when in the immortal ranks enlisted,
 I sometimes wonder if we shall not find
 That not by deeds, but by what we've resisted,
 Our places are assigned.
