title: In the Garden of God
---

Within the iron cities
One walked unknown for years,
In his heart the pity of pities
That grew for human tears

When love and grief were ended
The flower of pity grew;
By unseen hands 'twas tended
And fed with holy dew.

Though in his heart were barred in
The blooms of beauty blown;
Yet he who grew the garden
Could call no flower his own.

For by the hands that watered,
The blooms that opened fair
Through frost and pain were scattered
To sweeten the dull air.
