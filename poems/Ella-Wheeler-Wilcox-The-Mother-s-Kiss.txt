Love breathed a secret to her listening heart,
 And said "Be silent."Though she guarded it,
And dwelt as one within a world apart,
 Yet sun and star seemed by that secret lit.
And where she passed, each whispering wind ablow,
 And every little blossom in the sod,
Called joyously to her, "We know, we know,
 For are we not the intimates of God?"
Life grew so radiant, and so opulent,
 That when her fragile body and her brain
By mortal throes of agony were rent,
 She felt a curious rapture in her pain.
Then, after anguish, came the supreme bliss - 
They brought the little baby, for her kiss!
