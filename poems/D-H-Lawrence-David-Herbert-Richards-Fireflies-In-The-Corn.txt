She speaks.
Look at the little darlings in the corn!
 The rye is taller than you, who think yourself
So high and mighty: look how the heads are borne
Dark and proud on the sky, like a number of knights
Passing with spears and pennants and manly scorn.

Knights indeed! - much knight I know will ride
 With his head held high-serene against the sky!
Limping and following rather at my side
 Moaning for me to love him! - Oh darling rye
How I adore you for your simple pride!

And the dear, dear fireflies wafting in between
 And over the swaying corn-stalks, just above
All the dark-feathered helmets, like little green
 Stars come low and wandering here for love
Of these dark knights, shedding their delicate sheen!

I thank you I do, you happy creatures, you dears
 Riding the air, and carrying all the time
Your little lanterns behind you! Ah, it cheers
 My soul to see you settling and trying to climb
The corn-stalks, tipping with fire the spears.

All over the dim corn's motion, against the blue
 Dark sky of night, a wandering glitter, a swarm
Of questing brilliant souls going out with their true
 Proud knights to battle! Sweet, how I warm
My poor, my perished soul with the sight of you!
