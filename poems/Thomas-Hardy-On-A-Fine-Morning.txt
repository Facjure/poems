title: On A Fine Morning
---

Whence comes Solace? - Not from seeing
What is doing, suffering, being,
Not from noting Life's conditions,
Nor from heeding Time's monitions;
 But in cleaving to the Dream,
 And in gazing at the gleam
 Whereby gray things golden seem.


Thus do I this heyday, holding
Shadows but as lights unfolding,
As no specious show this moment
With its irised embowment;
 But as nothing other than
 Part of a benignant plan;
 Proof that earth was made for man.

February 1899.
