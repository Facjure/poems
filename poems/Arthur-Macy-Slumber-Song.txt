 Gently fall the shadows gray,
Daylight softly veiling;
 Now to Dreamland we'll away,
Sailing, sailing, sailing.

 Little eyes were made for sleeping,
Little heads were made for rest,
 Golden locks were made for keeping
Close to mother's breast;
 Little hands were made for folding,
Little lips should never sigh;
 What dear mother's arms are holding,
Love alone can buy.

 Gently fall the shadows gray,
Daylight softly veiling;
 Now to Dreamland we'll away,
Sailing, sailing, sailing.
