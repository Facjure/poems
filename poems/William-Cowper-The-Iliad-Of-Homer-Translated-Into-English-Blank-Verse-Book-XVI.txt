 Argument Of The Sixteenth Book.


Achilles, at the suit of Patroclus, grants him his own armor, and permission to lead the Myrmidons to battle. They, sallying, repulse the Trojans. Patroclus slays Sarpedon, and Hector, when Apollo had first stripped off his armor and Euphorbus wounded him, slays Patroclus.



 Such contest for that gallant bark they waged.
 Meantime Patroclus, standing at the side
 Of the illustrious Chief Achilles, wept
 Fast as a crystal fountain from the height
 Of some rude rock pours down its rapid[1] stream.
 Divine Achilles with compassion moved
 Mark'd him, and in wing'd accents thus began.[2]
 Who weeps Patroclus like an infant girl
 Who, running at her mother's side, entreats
 To be uplifted in her arms? She grasps
 Her mantle, checks her haste, and looking up
 With tearful eyes, pleads earnest to be borne;
 So fall, Patroclus! thy unceasing tears.
 Bring'st thou to me or to my people aught
 Afflictive? Hast thou mournful tidings learn'd
 Prom Phthia, trusted to thy ear alone?
 Menoetius, son of Actor, as they say,
 Still lives; still lives his Myrmidons among
 Peleus �acides; whom, were they dead,
 With cause sufficient we should both deplore.
 Or weep'st thou the Achaians at the ships
 Perishing, for their outrage done to me?
 Speak. Name thy trouble. I would learn the cause
 To whom, deep-sorrowing, thou didst reply,
 Patroclus! Oh Achilles, Peleus' son!
 Noblest of all our host! bear with my grief,
 Since such distress hath on the Grecians fallen.
 The bravest of their ships disabled lie,
 Some wounded from afar, some hand to hand.
 Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds,
 Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief,
 And Agamemnon suffer by the spear,
 And brave Eurypylus an arrow-point
 Bears in his thigh. These all, are now the care
 Of healing hands. Oh thou art pity-proof,
 Achilles! be my bosom ever free
 From anger such as harbor finds in thine,
 Scorning all limits! whom, of men unborn,
 Hereafter wilt thou save, from whom avert
 Disgrace, if not from the Achaians now?
 Ah ruthless! neither Peleus thee begat,
 Nor Thetis bore, but rugged rocks sublime,
 And roaring billows blue gave birth to thee,
 Who bear'st a mind that knows not to relent,
 But, if some prophecy alarm thy fears,
 If from thy Goddess-mother thou have aught
 Received, and with authority of Jove,
 Me send at least, me quickly, and with me
 The Myrmidons. A dawn of cheerful hope
 Shall thence, it may be, on the Greeks arise.
 Grant me thine armor also, that the foe
 Thyself supposing present, may abstain
 From battle, and the weary Greeks enjoy
 Short respite; it is all that war allows.
 We, fresh and vigorous, by our shouts alone
 May easily repulse an army spent
 With labor from the camp, and from the fleet,
 Such suit he made, alas! all unforewarn'd
 That his own death should be the bitter fruit,
 And thus Achilles, sorrowful, replied.
 Patroclus, noble friend! what hast thou spoken?
 Me neither prophesy that I have heard
 Holds in suspense, nor aught that I have learn'd
 From Thetis with authority of Jove!
 Hence springs, and hence alone, my grief of heart;
 If one, in nought superior to myself
 Save in his office only, should by force
 Amerce me of my well-earn'd recompense--
 How then? There lies the grief that stings my soul.
 The virgin chosen for me by the sons
 Of Greece, my just reward, by my own spear
 Obtain'd when I E�tion's city took,
 Her, Agamemnon, leader of the host
 From my possession wrung, as I had been
 Some alien wretch, unhonor'd and unknown.
 But let it pass; anger is not a flame
 To feed for ever; I affirm'd, indeed,
 Mine inextinguishable till the shout
 Of battle should invade my proper barks;
 But thou put on my glorious arms, lead forth
 My valiant Myrmidons, since such a cloud,
 So dark, of dire hostility surrounds
 The fleet, and the Achaians, by the waves
 Hemm'd in, are prison'd now in narrow space.
 Because the Trojans meet not in the field
 My dazzling helmet, therefore bolder grown
 All Ilium comes abroad; but had I found
 Kindness at royal Agamemnon's hands,
 Soon had they fled, and with their bodies chok'd
 The streams, from whom ourselves now suffer siege
 For in the hands of Diomede his spear
 No longer rages rescuing from death
 The afflicted Dana�, nor hear I more
 The voice of Agamemnon issuing harsh
 From his detested throat, but all around
 The burst[3] of homicidal Hector's cries,
 Calling his Trojans on; they loud insult
 The vanquish'd Greeks, and claim the field their own.
 Go therefore, my Patroclus; furious fall
 On these assailants, even now preserve
 From fire the only hope of our return.
 But hear the sum of all; mark well my word;
 So shalt thou glorify me in the eyes
 Of all the Dana�, and they shall yield
 Bris�is mine, with many a gift beside.
 The Trojans from the fleet expell'd, return.
 Should Juno's awful spouse give thee to win
 Victory, be content; seek not to press
 The Trojans without me, for thou shalt add
 Still more to the disgrace already mine.[4]
 Much less, by martial ardor urged, conduct
 Thy slaughtering legions to the walls of Troy,
 Lest some immortal power on her behalf
 Descend, for much the Archer of the skies
 Loves Ilium. No--the fleet once saved, lead back
 Thy band, and leave the battle to themselves.
 For oh, by all the powers of heaven I would
 That not one Trojan might escape of all,
 Nor yet a Grecian, but that we, from death
 Ourselves escaping, might survive to spread
 Troy's sacred bulwarks on the ground, alone.
 Thus they conferr'd. [5]But Ajax overwhelm'd
 Meantime with darts, no longer could endure,
 Quell'd both by Jupiter and by the spears
 Of many a noble Trojan; hideous rang
 His batter'd helmet bright, stroke after stroke
 Sustaining on all sides, and his left arm
 That had so long shifted from side to side
 His restless shield, now fail'd; yet could not all
 Displace him with united force, or move.
 Quick pantings heaved his chest, copious the sweat
 Trickled from all his limbs, nor found he time,
 However short, to breathe again, so close
 Evil on evil heap'd hemm'd him around.
 Olympian Muses! now declare, how first
 The fire was kindled in Achaia's fleet?
 Hector the ashen lance of Ajax smote
 With his broad falchion, at the nether end,
 And lopp'd it sheer. The Telamonian Chief
 His mutilated beam brandish'd in vain,
 And the bright point shrill-sounding-fell remote.
 Then Ajax in his noble mind perceived,
 Shuddering with awe, the interposing power
 Of heaven, and that, propitious to the arms
 Of Troy, the Thunderer had ordain'd to mar
 And frustrate all the counsels of the Greeks.
 He left his stand; they fired the gallant bark;
 Through all her length the conflagration ran
 Incontinent, and wrapp'd her stern in flames.
 Achilles saw them, smote his thighs, and said,
 Patroclus, noble charioteer, arise!
 I see the rapid run of hostile fires
 Already in the fleet--lest all be lost,
 And our return impossible, arm, arm
 This moment; I will call, myself, the band.
 Then put Patroclus on his radiant arms.
 Around his legs his polish'd greaves he clasp'd,
 With argent studs secured; the hauberk rich
 Star-spangled to his breast he bound of swift
 �acides; he slung his brazen sword
 With silver bright emboss'd, and his broad shield
 Ponderous; on his noble head his casque
 He settled elegant, whose lofty crest
 Waved dreadful o'er his brows, and last he seized
 Well fitted to his gripe two sturdy spears.
 Of all Achilles' arms his spear alone
 He took not; that huge beam, of bulk and length
 Enormous, none, �acides except,
 In all Achaia's host had power to wield.
 It was that Pelian ash which from the top
 Of Pelion hewn that it might prove the death
 Of heroes, Chiron had to Peleus given.
 He bade Automedon his coursers bind
 Speedily to the yoke, for him he loved
 Next to Achilles most, as worthiest found
 Of trust, what time the battle loudest roar'd.
 Then led Automedon the fiery steeds
 Swift as wing'd tempests to the chariot-yoke,
 Xanthus and Balius. Them the harpy bore
 Podarge, while in meadows green she fed
 On Ocean's side, to Zephyrus the wind.
 To these he added, at their side, a third,
 The noble Pedasus; him Peleus' son,
 E�tion's city taken, thence had brought,
 Though mortal, yet a match for steeds divine.
 Meantime from every tent Achilles call'd
 And arm'd his Myrmidons. As wolves that gorge
 The prey yet panting, terrible in force,
 When on the mountains wild they have devour'd
 An antler'd stag new-slain, with bloody jaws
 Troop all at once to some clear fountain, there
 To lap with slender tongues the brimming wave;
 No fears have they, but at their ease eject
 From full maws flatulent the clotted gore;
 Such seem'd the Myrmidon heroic Chiefs
 Assembling fast around the valiant friend
 Of swift �acides. Amid them stood
 Warlike Achilles, the well-shielded ranks
 Exhorting, and the steeds, to glorious war.
 The galleys by Achilles dear to Jove
 Commanded, when to Ilium's coast he steer'd,
 Were fifty; fifty rowers sat in each,
 And five, in whom he trusted, o'er the rest
 He captains named, but ruled, himself, supreme.
 One band Menestheus swift in battle led,
 Offspring of Sperchius heaven-descended stream.
 Him Polydora, Peleus' daughter, bore
 To ever-flowing Sperchius, compress'd,
 Although a mortal woman, by a God.
 But his reputed father was the son
 Of Perieres, Borus, who with dower
 Enrich'd, and made her openly his bride.
 Warlike Eudorus led the second band.
 Him Polymela, graceful in the dance,
 And daughter beautiful of Phylas, bore,
 A mother unsuspected of a child.
 Her worshiping the golden-shafted Queen
 Diana, in full choir, with song and dance,
 The valiant Argicide[6] beheld and loved.
 Ascending with her to an upper room,
 All-bounteous Mercury[7] clandestine there
 Embraced her, who a noble son produced
 Eudorus, swift to run, and bold in fight.
 No sooner Ilithya, arbitress
 Of pangs puerperal, had given him birth,
 And he beheld the beaming sun, than her
 Echechleus, Actor's mighty son, enrich'd
 With countless dower, and led her to his home;
 While ancient Phylas, cherishing her boy
 With fond affection, reared him as his own.
 The third brave troop warlike Pisander led,
 Offspring of Maimalus; he far excell'd
 In spear-fight every Myrmidon, the friend
 Of Peleus' dauntless son alone except.
 The hoary Phoenix of equestrian fame
 The fourth band led to battle, and the fifth
 La�rceus' offspring, bold Alcimedon.
 Thus, all his bands beneath their proper Chiefs
 Marshall'd, Achilles gave them strict command--
 Myrmidons! all that vengeance now inflict,
 Which in this fleet ye ceased not to denounce
 Against the Trojans while my wrath endured.
 Me censuring, ye have proclaim'd me oft
 Obdurate. Oh Achilles! ye have said,
 Thee not with milk thy mother but with bile
 Suckled, who hold'st thy people here in camp
 Thus long imprison'd. Unrelenting Chief!
 Even let us hence in our sea-skimming barks
 To Phthia, since thou can'st not be appeased--
 Thus in full council have ye spoken oft.
 Now, therefore, since a day of glorious toil
 At last appears, such as ye have desired,
 There lies the field--go--give your courage proof.
 So them he roused, and they, their leader's voice
 Hearing elate, to closest order drew.
 As when an architect some palace wall
 With shapely stones upbuilds, cementing close
 A barrier against all the winds of heaven,
 So wedged, the helmets and boss'd bucklers stood;
 Shield, helmet, man, press'd helmet, man, and shield,
 And every bright-arm'd warrior's bushy crest
 Its fellow swept, so dense was their array.
 In front of all, two Chiefs their station took,
 Patroclus and Automedon; one mind
 In both prevail'd, to combat in the van
 Of all the Myrmidons. Achilles, then,
 Retiring to his tent, displaced the lid
 Of a capacious chest magnificent
 By silver-footed Thetis stow'd on board
 His bark, and fill'd with tunics, mantles warm,
 And gorgeous arras; there he also kept
 Secure a goblet exquisitely wrought,
 Which never lip touched save his own, and whence
 He offer'd only to the Sire of all.
 That cup producing from the chest, he first
 With sulphur fumed it, then with water rinsed
 Pellucid of the running stream, and, last
 (His hands clean laved) he charged it high with wine.
 And now, advancing to his middle court,
 He pour'd libation, and with eyes to heaven
 Uplifted pray'd,[8] of Jove not unobserved.
 Pelasgian, Dodon�an Jove supreme,
 Dwelling remote, who on Dodona's heights
 Snow-clad reign'st Sovereign, by thy seers around
 Compass'd the Selli, prophets vow-constrain'd
 To unwash'd feet and slumbers on the ground!
 Plain I behold my former prayer perform'd,
 Myself exalted, and the Greeks abased.
 Now also grant me, Jove, this my desire!
 Here, in my fleet, I shall myself abide,
 But lo! with all these Myrmidons I send
 My friend to battle. Thunder-rolling Jove,
 Send glory with him, make his courage firm!
 That even Hector may himself be taught,
 If my companion have a valiant heart
 When he goes forth alone, or only then
 The noble frenzy feels that Mars inspires
 When I rush also to the glorious field.
 But when he shall have driven the battle-shout
 Once from the fleet, grant him with all his arms,
 None lost, himself unhurt, and my whole band
 Of dauntless warriors with him, safe return!
 Such prayer Achilles offer'd, and his suit
 Jove hearing, part confirm'd, and part refused;
 To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet
 He gave him, but vouchsafed him no return.
 Prayer and libation thus perform'd to Jove
 The Sire of all, Achilles to his tent
 Return'd, replaced the goblet in his chest,
 And anxious still that conflict to behold
 Between the hosts, stood forth before his tent.
 Then rush'd the bands by brave Patroclus led,
 Full on the Trojan host. As wasps forsake
 Their home by the way-side, provoked by boys
 Disturbing inconsiderate their abode,
 Not without nuisance sore to all who pass,
 For if, thenceforth, some traveller unaware
 Annoy them, issuing one and all they swarm
 Around him, fearless in their broods' defence,
 So issued from their fleet the Myrmidons
 Undaunted; clamor infinite arose,
 And thus Patroclus loud his host address'd.
 Oh Myrmidons, attendants in the field
 On Peleus' son, now be ye men, my friends!
 Call now to mind the fury of your might;
 That we, close-fighting servants of the Chief
 Most excellent in all the camp of Greece,
 May glory gain for him, and that the wide-
 Commanding Agamemnon, Atreus' son,
 May learn his fault, that he dishonor'd foul
 The prince in whom Achaia glories most.
 So saying he fired their hearts, and on the van
 Of Troy at once they fell; loud shouted all
 The joyful Grecians, and the navy rang.
 Then, soon as Ilium's host the valiant son
 Saw of Menoetius and his charioteer
 In dazzling armor clad, all courage lost,
 Their closest ranks gave way, believing sure
 That, wrath renounced, and terms of friendship chosen,
 Achilles' self was there; thus thinking, each
 Look'd every way for refuge from his fate.
 Patroclus first, where thickest throng he saw
 Gather'd tumultuous around the bark
 Of brave Protesila�s, hurl'd direct
 At the whole multitude his glittering spear.
 He smote Pyr�chmes; he his horsemen band
 Poeonian led from Amydon, and from
 Broad-flowing Axius. In his shoulder stood
 The spear, and with loud groans supine he fell.
 At once fled all his followers, on all sides
 With consternation fill'd, seeing their Chief
 And their best warrior, by Patroclus slain.
 Forth from the fleet he drove them, quench'd the flames,
 And rescued half the ship. Then scatter'd fled
 With infinite uproar the host of Troy,
 While from between their ships the Dana�
 Pour'd after them, and hideous rout ensued.
 As when the king of lightnings, Jove, dispels
 From some huge eminence a gloomy cloud,
 The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland heights
 Shine all, illumined from the boundless heaven,
 So when the Dana� those hostile fires
 Had from their fleet expell'd, awhile they breathed,
 Yet found short respite, for the battle yet
 Ceased not, nor fled the Trojans in all parts
 Alike, but still resisted, from the ships
 Retiring through necessity alone.
 Then, in that scatter'd warfare, every Chief
 Slew one. While Are�lochus his back
 Turn'd on Patroclus, sudden with a lance
 His thigh he pierced, and urged the weapon through,
 Shivering the bone; he headlong smote the ground.
 The hero Menelaus, where he saw
 The breast of Thoas by his slanting shield
 Unguarded, struck and stretch'd him at his feet.
 Phylides,[9] meeting with preventive spear
 The furious onset of Amphiclus, gash'd
 His leg below the knee, where brawny most
 The muscles swell in man; disparted wide
 The tendons shrank, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 The two Nestorid� slew each a Chief.
 Of these, Antilochus Atymnius pierced
 Right through his flank, and at his feet he fell.
 With fierce resentment fired Maris beheld
 His brother's fall, and guarding, spear in hand,
 The slain, impetuous on the conqueror flew;
 But godlike Thrasymedes[10] wounded first
 Maris, ere he Antilochus; he pierced
 His upper arm, and with the lance's point
 Rent off and stript the muscles to the bone.
 Sounding he fell, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 They thus, two brothers by two brothers slain,
 Went down to Erebus, associates both
 Of brave Sarpedon, and spear-practised sons
 Of Amisodarus; of him who fed
 Chim�ra,[11] monster, by whom many died.
 Ajax the swift on Cleobulus sprang,
 Whom while he toil'd entangled in the crowd,
 He seized alive, but smote him where he stood
 With his huge-hafted sword full on the neck;
 The blood warm'd all his blade, and ruthless fate
 Benighted dark the dying warrior's eyes.
 Peneleus into close contention rush'd
 And Lycon. Each had hurl'd his glittering spear,
 But each in vain, and now with swords they met.
 He smote Peneleus on the crested casque,
 But snapp'd his falchion; him Peneleus smote
 Beneath his ear; the whole blade entering sank
 Into his neck, and Lycon with his head
 Depending by the skin alone, expired.
 Meriones o'ertaking Acamas
 Ere yet he could ascend his chariot, thrust
 A lance into his shoulder; down he fell
 In dreary death's eternal darkness whelm'd.
 Idomeneus his ruthless spear enforced
 Into the mouth of Erymas. The point
 Stay'd not, but gliding close beneath the brain,
 Transpierced his spine,[12] and started forth beyond.
 It wrench'd his teeth, and fill'd his eyes with blood;
 Blood also blowing through his open mouth
 And nostrils, to the realms of death he pass'd.
 Thus slew these Grecian leaders, each, a foe.
 Sudden as hungry wolves the kids purloin
 Or lambs, which haply some unheeding swain
 Hath left to roam at large the mountains wild;
 They, seeing, snatch them from beside the dams,
 And rend incontinent the feeble prey,
 So swift the Dana� the host assail'd
 Of Ilium; they, into tumultuous flight
 Together driven, all hope, all courage lost.
 Huge Ajax ceaseless sought his spear to cast
 At Hector brazen-mail'd, who, not untaught
 The warrior's art, with bull-hide buckler stood
 Sheltering his ample shoulders, while he mark'd
 The hiss of flying shafts and crash of spears.
 Full sure he saw the shifting course of war
 Now turn'd, but scorning flight, bent all his thoughts
 To rescue yet the remnant of his friends.
 As when the Thunderer spreads a sable storm
 O'er ether, late serene, the cloud that wrapp'd
 Olympus' head escapes into the skies,
 So fled the Trojans from the fleet of Greece
 Clamoring in their flight, nor pass'd the trench
 In fair array; the coursers fleet indeed
 Of Hector, him bore safe with all his arms
 Right through, but in the foss entangled foul
 He left his host, and struggling to escape.
 Then many a chariot-whirling steed, the pole
 Broken at its extremity, forsook
 His driver, while Patroclus with the shout
 Of battle calling his Achaians on,
 Destruction purposed to the powers of Troy.
 They, once dispersed, with clamor and with flight
 Fill'd all the ways, the dust beneath the clouds
 Hung like a tempest, and the steeds firm-hoof'd
 Whirl'd off at stretch the chariots to the town.
 He, wheresoe'er most troubled he perceived
 The routed host, loud-threatening thither drove,
 While under his own axle many a Chief
 Fell prone, and the o'ertumbled chariots rang.
 Right o'er the hollow foss the coursers leap'd
 Immortal, by the Gods to Peleus given,
 Impatient for the plain, nor less desire
 Felt he who drove to smite the Trojan Chief,
 But him his fiery steeds caught swift away.
 As when a tempest from autumnal skies
 Floats all the fields, what time Jove heaviest pours
 Impetuous rain, token of wrath divine
 Against perverters of the laws by force,
 Who drive forth justice, reckless of the Gods;
 The rivers and the torrents, where they dwell,
 Sweep many a green declivity away,
 And plunge at length, groaning, into the Deep
 From the hills headlong, leaving where they pass'd
 No traces of the pleasant works of man,
 So, in their flight, loud groan'd the steeds of Troy.
 And now, their foremost intercepted all,
 Patroclus back again toward the fleet
 Drove them precipitate, nor the ascent
 Permitted them to Troy for which they strove,
 But in the midway space between the ships
 The river and the lofty Trojan wall
 Pursued them ardent, slaughtering whom he reached,
 And vengeance took for many a Grecian slain.
 First then, with glittering spear the breast he pierced
 Of Pron�us, undefended by his shield,
 And stretch'd him dead; loud rang his batter'd arms.
 The son of Enops, Thestor next he smote.
 He on his chariot-seat magnificent
 Low-cowering sat, a fear-distracted form,
 And from his palsied grasp the reins had fallen.
 Then came Patroclus nigh, and through his cheek
 His teeth transpiercing, drew him by his lance
 Sheer o'er the chariot front. As when a man
 On some projecting rock seated, with line
 And splendid hook draws forth a sea-fish huge,
 So him wide-gaping from his seat he drew
 At his spear-point, then shook him to the ground
 Prone on his face, where gasping he expired.
 At Eryalus, next, advancing swift
 He hurl'd a rock; full on the middle front
 He smote him, and within the ponderous casque
 His whole head open'd into equal halves.
 With deadliest night surrounded, prone he fell.
 Epaltes, Erymas, Amphoterus,
 Echius, Tlepolemus Damastor's son,
 Evippus, Ipheus, Pyres, Polymelus,
 All these he on the champain, corse on corse
 Promiscuous flung. Sarpedon, when he saw
 Such havoc made of his uncinctured[13] friends
 By Menoetiades, with sharp rebuke
 His band of godlike Lycians loud address'd.
 Shame on you, Lycians! whither would ye fly?
 Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose
 Myself this conqueror, that I may learn
 Who thus afflicts the Trojan host, of life
 Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold.
 He said, and with his arms leap'd to the ground.
 On the other side, Patroclus at that sight
 Sprang from his chariot. As two vultures clash
 Bow-beak'd, crook-talon'd, on some lofty rock
 Clamoring both, so they together rush'd
 With clamors loud; whom when the son observed
 Of wily Saturn, with compassion moved
 His sister and his spouse he thus bespake.
 Alas, he falls! my most beloved of men
 Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls!
 So will the Fates. Yet, doubtful, much I muse
 Whether to place him, snatch'd from furious fight
 In Lycia's wealthy realm, or to permit
 His death by valiant Menoetiades.
 To whom his awful spouse, displeased, replied.
 How speaks the terrible Saturnian Jove!
 Wouldst thou again from pangs of death exempt
 A mortal man, destined long since to die?
 Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven,
 Mark thou my words, and in thy inmost breast
 Treasure them. If thou send Sarpedon safe
 To his own home, how many Gods their sons
 May also send from battle? Weigh it well.
 For under yon great city fight no few
 Sprung from Immortals whom thou shalt provoke.
 But if thou love him, and thine heart his lot
 Commiserate, leave him by the hands to fall
 Of Menoetiades in conflict dire;
 But give command to Death and gentle Sleep
 That him of life bereft at once they bear
 To Lycia's ample realm,[14] where, with due rites
 Funereal, his next kindred and his friends
 Shall honor him, a pillar and a tomb
 (The dead man's portion) rearing to his name.
 She said, from whom the Sire of Gods and men
 Dissented not, but on the earth distill'd
 A sanguine shower in honor of a son
 Dear to him, whom Patroclus on the field
 Of fruitful Troy should slay, far from his home.
 Opposite now, small interval between,
 Those heroes stood. Patroclus at his waist
 Pierced Thrasymelus the illustrious friend
 Of King Sarpedon, and his charioteer.
 Spear'd through the lower bowels, dead he fell.
 Then hurl'd Sarpedon in his turn a lance,
 But miss'd Patroclus and the shoulder pierced
 Of Pedasus the horse; he groaning heaved
 His spirit forth, and fallen on the field
 In long loud moanings sorrowful expired.
 Wide started the immortal pair; the yoke
 Creak'd, and entanglement of reins ensued
 To both, their fellow slaughter'd at their side.
 That mischief soon Automedon redress'd.
 He rose, and from beside his sturdy thigh
 Drawing his falchion, with effectual stroke
 Cut loose the side-horse; then the pair reduced
 To order, in their traces stood composed,
 And the two heroes fierce engaged again.
 Again his radiant spear Sarpedon hurl'd,
 But miss'd Patroclus; the innocuous point,
 O'erflying his left shoulder, pass'd beyond.
 Then with bright lance Patroclus in his turn
 Assail'd Sarpedon, nor with erring course
 The weapon sped or vain, but pierced profound
 His chest, enclosure of the guarded heart.
 As falls an oak, poplar, or lofty pine
 With new-edged axes on the mountains hewn
 Right through, for structure of some gallant bark,
 So fell Sarpedon stretch'd his steeds before
 And gnash'd his teeth and clutch'd the bloody dust,
 And as a lion slays a tawny bull
 Leader magnanimous of all the herd;
 Beneath the lion's jaws groaning he dies;
 So, leader of the shielded Lycians groan'd
 Indignant, by Patroclus slain, the bold
 Sarpedon, and his friend thus, sad, bespake.
 Glaucus, my friend, among these warring Chiefs
 Thyself a Chief illustrious! thou hast need
 Of all thy valor now; now strenuous fight,
 And, if thou bear within thee a brave mind,
 Now make the war's calamities thy joy.
 First, marching through the host of Lycia, rouse
 Our Chiefs to combat for Sarpedon slain,
 Then haste, thyself, to battle for thy friend.
 For shame and foul dishonor which no time
 Shall e'er obliterate, I must prove to thee,
 Should the Achaians of my glorious arms
 Despoil me in full prospect[15] of the fleet.
 Fight, therefore, thou, and others urge to fight.
 He said, and cover'd by the night of death,
 Nor look'd nor breath'd again; for on his chest
 Implanting firm his heel, Patroclus drew
 The spear enfolded with his vitals forth,
 Weapon and life at once. Meantime his steeds
 Snorted, by Myrmidons detain'd, and, loosed
 From their own master's chariot, foam'd to fly.
 Terrible was the grief by Glaucus felt,
 Hearing that charge, and troubled was his heart
 That all power fail'd him to protect the dead.
 Compressing his own arm he stood, with pain
 Extreme tormented which the shaft had caused
 Of Teucer, who while Glaucus climb'd the wall,
 Had pierced him from it, in the fleet's defence.
 Then, thus, to Phoebus, King shaft-arm'd, he pray'd.
 Hear now, O King! For whether in the land
 Of wealthy Lycia dwelling, or in Troy,
 Thou hear'st in every place alike the prayer
 Of the afflicted heart, and such is mine;
 Behold my wound; it fills my useless hand
 With anguish, neither can my blood be stay'd,
 And all my shoulder suffers. I can grasp
 A spear, or rush to conflict with the Greeks
 No longer now; and we have also lost
 Our noblest Chief, Sarpedon, son of Jove,
 Who guards not his own son. But thou, O King!
 Heal me, assuage my anguish, give me strength,
 That I may animate the Lycian host
 To fight, and may, myself, defend the dead!
 Such prayer he offer'd, whom Apollo heard;
 He eased at once his pain, the sable blood
 Staunch'd, and his soul with vigor new inspired.
 Then Glaucus in his heart that prayer perceived
 Granted, and joyful for the sudden aid
 Vouchsafed to him by Phoebus, first the lines
 Of Lycia ranged, summoning every Chief
 To fight for slain Sarpedon; striding next
 With eager haste into the ranks of Troy,
 Renown'd Agenor and the son he call'd
 Of Panthus, brave Polydamas, with whom
 �neas also, and approaching last
 To Hector brazen-mail'd him thus bespake.
 Now, Hector! now, thou hast indeed resign'd
 All care of thy allies, who, for thy sake,
 Lost both to friends and country, on these plains
 Perish, unaided and unmiss'd by thee.
 Sarpedon breathless lies, who led to fight
 Our shielded bands, and from whose just control
 And courage Lycia drew her chief defence.
 Him brazen Mars hath by the spear subdued
 Of Menoetiades. But stand ye firm!
 Let indignation fire you, O my friends!
 Lest, stripping him of his resplendent arms,
 The Myrmidons with foul dishonor shame
 His body, through resentment of the deaths
 Of numerous Grecians slain by spears of ours.
 He ceased; then sorrow every Trojan heart
 Seized insupportable and that disdain'd
 All bounds, for that, although a stranger born,
 Sarpedon ever had a bulwark proved
 To Troy, the leader of a numerous host,
 And of that host by none in fight excell'd.
 Right on toward the Dana� they moved
 Ardent for battle all, and at their head
 Enraged for slain Sarpedon, Hector came.
 Meantime, stout-hearted[16] Chief, Patroclus roused
 The Grecians, and exhorting first (themselves
 Already prompt) the Ajaces, thus began.
 Heroic pair! now make it all your joy
 To chase the Trojan host, and such to prove
 As erst, or even bolder, if ye may.
 The Chief lies breathless who ascended first
 Our wall, Sarpedon. Let us bear him hence,
 Strip and dishonor him, and in the blood
 Of his protectors drench the ruthless spear.
 So Menoetiades his warriors urged,
 Themselves courageous. Then the Lycian host
 And Trojan here, and there the Myrmidons
 With all the host of Greece, closing the ranks
 Rush'd into furious contest for the dead,
 Shouting tremendous; clang'd their brazen arms,
 And Jove with Night's pernicious shades[17] o'erhung
 The bloody field, so to enhance the more
 Their toilsome strife for his own son. First then
 The Trojans from their place and order shock'd
 The bright-eyed Grecians, slaying not the least
 Nor worst among the Myrmidons, the brave
 Epigeus from renown'd Agacles sprung.
 He, erst, in populous Budeum ruled,
 But for a valiant kinsman of his own
 Whom there he slew, had thence to Peleus fled
 And to his silver-footed spouse divine,
 Who with Achilles, phalanx-breaker Chief,
 Sent him to fight beneath the walls of Troy.
 Him seizing fast the body, with a stone
 Illustrious Hector smote full on the front,
 And his whole skull within the ponderous casque
 Split sheer; he prostrate on the body fell
 In shades of soul-divorcing death involved.
 Patroclus, grieving for his slaughter'd friend,
 Rush'd through the foremost warriors. As the hawk
 Swift-wing'd before him starlings drives or daws,
 So thou, Patroclus, of equestrian fame!
 Full on the Lycian ranks and Trojan drov'st,
 Resentful of thy fellow-warrior's fall.
 At Sthenela�s a huge stone he cast,
 Son of Ith�menes, whom on the neck
 He smote and burst the tendons; then the van
 Of Ilium's host, with Hector, all retired.
 Far as the slender javelin cuts the air
 Hurl'd with collected force, or in the games,
 Or even in battle at a desperate foe,
 So far the Greeks repulsed the host of Troy.
 Then Glaucus first, Chief of the shielded bands
 Of Lycia, slew Bathycles, valiant son
 Of Calchon; Hellas was his home, and far
 He pass'd in riches all the Myrmidons.
 Him chasing Glaucus whom he now attain'd,
 The Lycian, turning sudden, with his lance
 Pierced through the breast, and, sounding, down he fell
 Grief fill'd Achaia's sons for such a Chief
 So slain, but joy the Trojans; thick they throng'd
 The conqueror around, nor yet the Greeks
 Forgat their force, but resolute advanced.
 Then, by Meriones a Trojan died
 Of noble rank, Laogonus, the son
 Undaunted of Onetor great in Troy,
 Priest of Id�an Jove. The ear and jaw
 Between, he pierced him with a mortal force;
 Swift flew the life, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 �neas, in return, his brazen spear
 Hurl'd at Meriones with ardent hope
 To pierce him, while, with nimble[18] steps and short
 Behind his buckler made, he paced the field;
 But, warn'd of its approach, Meriones
 Bow'd low his head, shunning it, and the spear
 Behind him pierced the soil; there quivering stood
 The weapon, vain, though from a vigorous arm,
 Till spent by slow degrees its fury slept.
 * * * * *
 * * * * *[19]
 Indignant then �neas thus exclaim'd.
 Meriones! I sent thee such a spear
 As reaching thee, should have for ever marr'd
 Thy step, accomplish'd dancer as thou art.
 To whom Meriones spear-famed replied.
 �neas! thou wilt find the labor hard
 How great soe'er thy might, to quell the force
 Of all opposers. Thou art also doom'd
 Thyself to die; and may but spear of mine
 Well-aim'd once strike thee full, what strength soe'er
 Or magnanimity be thine to boast,
 Thy glory in that moment thou resign'st
 To me, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.
 He said, but him Patroclus sharp reproved.
 Why speaks Meriones, although in fight
 Approved, thus proudly? Nay, my gallant friend!
 The Trojans will not for reproach of ours
 Renounce the body. Blood must first be spilt.
 Tongues in debate, but hands in war decide;
 Deeds therefore now, not wordy vaunts, we need.
 So saying he led the way, whom follow'd close
 Godlike Meriones. As from the depth
 Of some lone wood that clothes the mountain's side
 The fellers at their toil are heard remote,
 So, from the face of Ilium's ample plain
 Reverberated, was the din of brass
 And of tough targets heard by falchions huge
 Hard-smitten, and by spears of double-edge.
 None then, no, not the quickest to discern,
 Had known divine Sarpedon, from his head
 To his foot-sole with mingled blood and dust
 Polluted, and o'erwhelm'd with weapons. They
 Around the body swarm'd. As hovel-flies
 In spring-time buzz around the brimming pails
 With milk bedew'd, so they around the dead.
 Nor Jove averted once his glorious eyes
 From that dread contest, but with watchful note
 Marked all, the future death in battle deep
 Pondering of Patroclus, whether him
 Hector should even now slay on divine
 Sarpedon, and despoil him of his arms,
 Or he should still that arduous strife prolong.
 This counsel gain'd as eligible most
 At length his preference: that the valiant friend
 Of Peleus' son should yet again compel
 The Trojan host with Hector brazen-mail'd
 To Ilium, slaughtering numerous by the way.
 First then, with fears unmanly he possess'd
 The heart of Hector; mounting to his seat
 He turn'd to flight himself, and bade his host
 Fly also; for he knew Jove's purpose[20] changed.
 Thenceforth, no longer even Lycia's host
 Endured, but all fled scatter'd, seeing pierced
 Their sovereign through his heart, and heap'd with dead;
 For numerous, while Saturnian Jove the fight
 Held in suspense, had on his body fallen.
 At once the Grecians of his dazzling arms
 Despoil'd Sarpedon, which the Myrmidons
 By order of Menoetius' valiant son
 Bore thence into the fleet. Meantime his will
 The Thunderer to Apollo thus express'd.
 Phoebus, my son, delay not; from beneath
 Yon hill of weapons drawn cleanse from his blood
 Sarpedon's corse; then, bearing him remote,
 Lave him in waters of the running stream,
 With oils divine anoint, and in attire
 Immortal clothe him. Last, to Death and Sleep,
 Swift bearers both, twin-born, deliver him;
 For hence to Lycia's opulent abodes
 They shall transport him quickly, where, with rites
 Funereal, his next kindred and his friends
 Shall honor him, a pillar and a tomb
 (The dead man's portion) rearing to his name.
 He ceased; nor was Apollo slow to hear
 His father's will, but, from the Id�an heights
 Descending swift into the dreadful field,
 Godlike Sarpedon's body from beneath
 The hill of weapons drew, which, borne remote,
 He laved in waters of the running stream,
 With oils ambrosial bathed, and clothed in robes
 Immortal. Then to Death and gentle Sleep,
 Swift-bearers both, twin-born, he gave the charge,
 Who placed it soon in Lycia's wealthy realm.
 Meantime Patroclus, calling to his steeds,
 And to Automedon, the Trojans chased
 And Lycians, on his own destruction bent
 Infatuate; heedless of his charge received
 From Peleus' son, which, well perform'd, had saved
 The hero from his miserable doom.
 But Jove's high purpose evermore prevails
 Against the thoughts of man; he turns to flight
 The bravest, and the victory takes with ease
 E'en from the Chief whom he impels himself
 To battle, as he now this Chief impell'd.
 Who, then, Patroclus! first, who last by thee
 Fell slain, what time thyself was call'd to die?
 Adrastus first, then Perimus he slew,
 Offspring of Megas, then Autono�s,
 Echechlus, Melanippus, and Epistor,
 Pylartes, Mulius, Elasus. All these
 He slew, and from the field chased all beside.
 Then, doubtless, had Achaia's sons prevail'd
 To take proud-gated Troy, such havoc made
 He with his spear, but that the son of Jove
 Apollo, on a tower's conspicuous height
 Station'd, devoted him for Ilium's sake.
 Thrice on a buttress of the lofty wall
 Patroclus mounted, and him thrice the God
 With hands immortal his resplendent shield
 Smiting, struck down again; but when he rush'd
 A fourth time, demon-like, to the assault,
 The King of radiant shafts him, stern, rebuked.
 Patroclus, warrior of renown, retire!
 The fates ordain not that imperial Troy
 Stoop to thy spear, nor to the spear itself
 Of Peleus' son, though mightier far than thou.
 He said, and Menoetiades the wrath
 Of shaft-arm'd Phoebus shunning, far retired.
 But in the Sc�an gate Hector his steeds
 Detain'd, uncertain whether thence to drive
 Amid the warring multitude again,
 Or, loud commandment issuing, to collect
 His host within the walls. Him musing long
 Apollo, clad in semblance of a Chief
 Youthful and valiant, join'd. Asius he seem'd
 Equestrian Hector's uncle, brother born
 Of Hecuba the queen, and Dymas' son,
 Who on the Sangar's banks in Phrygia dwelt.
 Apollo, so disguised, him thus bespake.
 Why, Hector, hast thou left the fight? this sloth
 Not well befits thee. Oh that I as far
 Thee pass'd in force as thou transcendest me,
 Then, not unpunish'd long, should'st thou retire;
 But haste, and with thy coursers solid-hoof'd
 Seek out Patroclus, him perchance to slay,
 Should Phoebus have decreed that glory thine.
 So saying, Apollo join'd the host again.
 Then noble Hector bade his charioteer

 Valiant Cebriones his coursers lash
 Back into battle, while the God himself
 Entering the multitude confounded sore
 The Argives, victory conferring proud
 And glory on Hector and the host of Troy.
 But Hector, leaving all beside unslain,
 Furious impell'd his coursers solid-hoof'd
 Against Patroclus; on the other side
 Patroclus from his chariot to the ground
 Leap'd ardent; in his left a spear he bore,
 And in his right a marble fragment rough,
 Large as his grasp. With full collected might
 He hurl'd it; neither was the weapon slow
 To whom he had mark'd, or sent in vain.
 He smote the charioteer of Hector, bold
 Cebriones, King Priam's spurious son,
 Full on the forehead, while he sway'd the reins.
 The bone that force withstood not, but the rock
 With ragged points beset dash'd both his brows
 In pieces, and his eyes fell at his feet.
 He diver-like, from his exalted stand
 Behind the steeds pitch'd headlong, and expired;
 O'er whom, Patroclus of equestrian fame!
 Thou didst exult with taunting speech severe.
 Ye Gods, with what agility he dives!
 Ah! it were well if in the fishy deep
 This man were occupied; he might no few
 With oysters satisfy, although the waves
 Were churlish, plunging headlong from his bark
 As easily as from his chariot here.
 So then--in Troy, it seems, are divers too!
 So saying, on bold Cebriones he sprang
 With all a lion's force, who, while the folds
 He ravages, is wounded in the breast,
 And, victim of his own fierce courage, dies.
 So didst thou spring, Patroclus! to despoil
 Cebriones, and Hector opposite
 Leap'd also to the ground. Then contest such
 For dead Cebriones those two between
 Arose, as in the lofty mountain-tops
 Two lions wage, contending for a deer
 New-slain, both hunger-pinch'd and haughty both.
 So for Cebriones, alike in arms
 Expert, brave Hector and Patroclus strove
 To pierce each other with the ruthless spear.
 First, Hector seized his head, nor loosed his hold,
 Patroclus, next, his feet, while all beside
 Of either host in furious battle join'd.
 As when the East wind and the South contend
 To shake some deep wood on the mountain's side,
 Or beech, or ash, or rugged cornel old.
 With stormy violence the mingled boughs
 Smite and snap short each other, crashing loud;
 So, Trojans and Achaians, mingling, slew
 Mutual, while neither felt a wish to fly.
 Around Cebriones stood many a spear,
 And many a shaft sent smartly from the nerve
 Implanted deep, and many a stone of grasp
 Enormous sounded on their batter'd shields
 Who fought to gain him. He, in eddies lost
 Of sable dust, with his huge trunk huge space
 O'erspread, nor steeds nor chariots heeded more.
 While yet the sun ascending climb'd the heavens,
 Their darts flew equal, and the people fell;
 But when he westward journey'd, by a change
 Surpassing hope the Grecians then prevail'd.
 They drew Cebriones the hero forth
 From all those weapons, and his armor stripp'd
 At leisure, distant from the battle's roar.
 Then sprang Patroclus on the Trojan host;
 Thrice, like another Mars, he sprang with shouts
 Tremendous, and nine warriors thrice he slew.
 But when the fourth time, demon-like, he rush'd
 Against them, then, oh then, too manifest
 The consummation of thy days approach'd
 Patroclus! whom Apollo, terror-clad
 Met then in battle. He the coming God
 Through all that multitude knew not, such gloom
 Impenetrable him involved around.
 Behind him close he stood, and with his palms
 Expanded on the spine and shoulders broad
 Smote him; his eyes swam dizzy at the stroke.
 Then Phoebus from his head his helmet dash'd
 To earth; sonorous at the feet it roll'd
 Of many a prancing steed, and all the crest
 Defilement gather'd gross of dust and blood,
 Then first; till then, impossible; for how
 Should dust the tresses of that helmet shame
 With which Achilles fighting fenced his head
 Illustrious, and his graceful brows divine?
 But Jove now made it Hector's; he awhile
 Bore it, himself to swift perdition doom'd
 His spear brass-mounted, ponderous, huge and long,
 Fell shiver'd from his grasp. His shield that swept
 His ancle, with its belt dropp'd from his arm,
 And Phoebus loosed the corselet from his breast.
 Confusion seized his brain; his noble limbs
 Quaked under him, and panic-stunn'd he stood.
 Then came a Dardan Chief, who from behind
 Enforced a pointed lance into his back
 Between the shoulders; Panthus' son was he,
 Euphorbus, famous for equestrian skill,
 For spearmanship, and in the rapid race
 Past all of equal age. He twenty men
 (Although a learner yet of martial feats,
 And by his steeds then first to battle borne)
 Dismounted. He, Patroclus, mighty Chief!
 First threw a lance at thee, which yet life
 Quell'd not; then snatching hasty from the wound
 His ashen beam, he ran into the crowd,
 Nor dared confront in fight even the unarm'd
 Patroclus. But Patroclus, by the lance,
 And by the stroke of an immortal hand
 Subdued, fell back toward his ranks again.
 Then, soon as Hector the retreat perceived
 Of brave Patroclus wounded, issuing forth
 From his own phalanx, he approach'd and drove
 A spear right through his body at the waist.
 Sounding he fell. Loud groan'd Achaia's host.
 As when the lion and the sturdy boar
 Contend in battle on the mountain-tops
 For some scant rivulet, thirst-parch'd alike,
 Ere long the lion quells the panting boar;
 So Priameian Hector, spear in hand,
 Slew Menoetiades the valiant slayer
 Of multitudes, and thus in accents wing'd,
 With fierce delight exulted in his fall.
 It was thy thought, Patroclus, to have laid
 Our city waste, and to have wafted hence
 Our wives and daughters to thy native land,
 Their day of liberty for ever set.
 Fool! for their sakes the feet of Hector's steeds
 Fly into battle, and myself excel,
 For their sakes, all our bravest of the spear,
 That I may turn from them that evil hour
 Necessitous. But thou art vulture's food,
 Unhappy youth! all valiant as he is,
 Achilles hath no succor given to thee,
 Who when he sent the forth whither himself
 Would not, thus doubtless gave thee oft in charge:
 Ah, well beware, Patroclus, glorious Chief!
 That thou revisit not these ships again,
 Till first on hero-slaughterer Hector's breast
 Thou cleave his bloody corselet. So he spake,
 And with vain words thee credulous beguiled.
 To whom Patroclus, mighty Chief, with breath
 Drawn faintly, and dying, thou didst thus reply.
 Now, Hector, boast! now glory! for the son
 Of Saturn and Apollo, me with ease
 Vanquishing, whom they had themselves disarm'd,
 Have made the victory thine; else, twenty such
 As thou, had fallen by my victorious spear.
 Me Phoebus and my ruthless fate combined
 To slay; these foremost; but of mortal men
 Euphorbus, and thy praise is only third.
 I tell thee also, and within thy heart
 Repose it deep--thou shalt not long survive;
 But, even now, fate, and a violent death
 Attend thee by Achilles' hands ordain'd
 To perish, by �acides the brave.[21]
 So saying, the shades of death him wrapp'd around.
 Down into Ades from his limbs dismiss'd,
 His spirit fled sorrowful, of youth's prime
 And vigorous manhood suddenly bereft
 Then, him though dead, Hector again bespake.
 Patroclus! these prophetic strains of death
 At hand, and fate, why hast thou sung to me?
 May not the son of Thetis azure-hair'd,
 Achilles, perish first by spear of mine?
 He said; then pressing with his heel the trunk
 Supine, and backward thursting it, he drew
 His glittering weapon from the wound, nor stay'd,
 But lance in hand, the godlike charioteer
 Pursued of swift �acides, on fire
 To smite Automedon; but him the steeds
 Immortal, rapid, by the Gods conferr'd
 (A glorious gift) on Peleus, snatch'd away.
