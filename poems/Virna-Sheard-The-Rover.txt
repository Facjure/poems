Though I follow a trail to north or south,
 Though I travel east or west,
There's a little house on a quiet road
 That my hidden heart loves best;
And when my journeys are over and done,
 'Tis there I will go to rest.

The snows have bleached it this many a year;
 The sun has painted it grey;
The vines hold it close in their clinging arms;
 The shadows creep there to stay;
And the wind goes calling through empty rooms
 For those who have gone away.

But the roses against the window-pane
 Are the roses I used to know;
And the rain on the roof still sings the song
 It sang in the long ago,
When I lay me down to sleep in a bed
 Little and white and low.

It is long since I bid it all good-bye,
 With young light-hearted disdain;
I remember who stood at the door that day;
 Her tears fell fast as the rain;
And I whistled a tune and waved my hand,
 But never went back again.

Toll I have paid at the gates of the world,
 The sand I know and the sea;
I have taken the wide and open road,
 With steps unhindered and free;
Yet, like a bell ringing down in my heart,
 My home is calling to me.
