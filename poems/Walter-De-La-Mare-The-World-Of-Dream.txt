 Now, through the dusk
 With muffled bell
 The Dustman comes
The World to tell,
 Night's elfin lanterns
Burn and gleam
 In the twilight, wonderful
World of Dream.

 Hollow and dim
Sleep's boat doth ride,
 Heavily still
At the waterside.
 Patter, patter,
The children come,
 Yawning and sleepy,
Out of the gloom.

 Like droning bees
In a garden green,
 Over the thwarts
They clamber in.
 And lovely Sleep
With long-drawn oar
 Turns away
From the whispering shore.

 Over the water
Like roses glide
 Her hundreds of passengers
Packed inside,
 To where in her garden
Tremble and gleam
 The harps and lamps
Of the World of Dream.
