title: The "Alice Jean".

 One moonlit night a ship drove in,
 A ghost ship from the west,
 Drifting with bare mast and lone tiller,
 Like a mermaid drest
 In long green weed and barnacles:
 She beached and came to rest.

 All the watchers of the coast
 Flocked to view the sight,
 Men and women streaming down
 Through the summer night,
 Found her standing tall and ragged
 Beached in the moonlight.

 Then one old woman looked and wept
 "The 'Alice Jean'?But no!
 The ship that took my Dick from me
 Sixty years ago
 Drifted back from the utmost west
 With the ocean's flow?

 "Caught and caged in the weedy pool
 Beyond the western brink,
 Where crewless vessels lie and rot
 in waters black as ink.
 Torn out again by a sudden storm
 Is it the 'Jean', you think?"

 A hundred women stared agape,
 The menfolk nudged and laughed,
 But none could find a likelier story
 For the strange craft.
 With fear and death and desolation
 Rigged fore and aft.

 The blind ship came forgotten home
 To all but one of these
 Of whom none dared to climb aboard her:
 And by and by the breeze
 Sprang to a storm and the "Alice Jean"
 Foundered in frothy seas.
