Thine eyes are dim:
 A mist hath gathered there;
Around their rim
 Float many clouds of care,
 And there is sorrow every -- everywhere.

But there is God,
 Every -- everywhere;
Beneath His rod
 Kneel thou adown in prayer.

For grief is God's own kiss
 Upon a soul.
Look up! the sun of bliss
 Will shine where storm-clouds roll.

Yes, weeper, weep!
 'Twill not be evermore;
I know the darkest deep
 Hath e'en the brightest shore.

So tired! so tired!
 A cry of half despair;
Look! at your side --
 And see Who standeth there!

Your Father! Hush!
 A heart beats in His breast;
Now rise and rush
 Into His arms -- and rest.
