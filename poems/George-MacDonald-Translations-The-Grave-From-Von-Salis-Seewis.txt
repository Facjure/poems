The grave is deep and soundless,
 Its brink is ghastly lone;
With veil all dark and boundless
 It hides a land unknown.

The nightingale's sweet closes
 Down there come not at all;
And friendship's withered roses
 On the mossy hillock fall.

Their hands young brides forsaken
 Wring bleeding there in vain;
The cries of orphans waken
 No answer to their pain.

Yet nowhere else for mortals
 Dwells their implored repose;
Through none but those dark portals
 Home to his rest man goes.

The poor heart, here for ever
 By storm on storm beat sore,
Its true peace gaineth never
 But where it beats no more.
