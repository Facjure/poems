title: Down Among The Dead Men
---

Come, comrades, come, your glasses clink;
Up with your hands a health to drink,
The health of all that workers be,
In every land, on every sea.
 And he that will this health deny,
 Down among the dead men, down among the dead men,
 Down, down, down, down,
 Down among the dead men let him lie!

Well done! now drink another toast,
And pledge the gath'ring of the host,
The people armed in brain and hand,
To claim their rights in every land.
 And he that will this health deny,
 Down among the dead men, down among the dead men,
 Down, down, down, down,
 Down among the dead men let him lie!

There's liquor left; come, let's be kind,
And drink the rich a better mind,
That when we knock upon the door,
They may be off and say no more.
 And he that will this health deny,
 Down among the dead men, down among the dead men,
 Down, down, down, down,
 Down among the dead men let him lie!

Now, comrades, let the glass blush red,
Drink we the unforgotten dead
That did their deeds and went away,
Before the bright sun brought the day.
 And he that will this health deny,
 Down among the dead men, down among the dead men,
 Down, down, down, down,
 Down among the dead men let him lie!

The Day?Ah, friends, late grows the night;
Drink to the glimmering spark of light,
The herald of the joy to be,
The battle-torch of thee and me!
 And he that will this health deny,
 Down among the dead men, down among the dead men,
 Down, down, down, down,
 Down among the dead men let him lie!

Take yet another cup in hand
And drink in hope our little band;
Drink strife in hope while lasteth breath,
And brotherhood in life and death;
 And he that will this health deny,
 Down among the dead men, down among the dead men,
 Down, down, down, down,
 Down among the dead men let him lie!
