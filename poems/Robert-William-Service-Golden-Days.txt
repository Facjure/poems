 Another day of toil and strife,
 Another page so white,
 Within that fateful Log of Life
 That I and all must write;
 Another page without a stain
 To make of as I may,
 That done, I shall not see again
 Until the Judgment Day.

 Ah, could I, could I backward turn
 The pages of that Book,
 How often would I blench and burn!
 How often loathe to look!
 What pages would be meanly scrolled;
 What smeared as if with mud;
 A few, maybe, might gleam like gold,
 Some scarlet seem as blood.

 O Record grave, God guide my hand
 And make me worthy be,
 Since what I write to-day shall stand
 To all eternity;
 Aye, teach me, Lord of Life, I pray,
 As I salute the sun,
 To bear myself that every day
 May be a Golden One.
