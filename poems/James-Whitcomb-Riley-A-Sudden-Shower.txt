title: A Sudden Shower
---

Barefooted boys scud up the street
 Or skurry under sheltering sheds;
And schoolgirl faces, pale and sweet,
 Gleam from the shawls about their heads.

Doors bang; and mother-voices call
 From alien homes; and rusty gates
Are slammed; and high above it all,
 The thunder grim reverberates.

And then, abrupt, - the rain! the rain! -
 The earth lies gasping; and the eyes
Behind the streaming window-pane
 Smile at the trouble of the skies.

The highway smokes; sharp echoes ring;
 The cattle bawl and cowbells clank;
And into town comes galloping
 The farmer's horse, with streaming flank.

The swallow dips beneath the eaves,
 And flirts his plumes and folds his wings;
And under the catawba leaves
 The caterpillar curls and clings.

The bumble-bee is pelted down
 The wet stem of the hollyhock;
And sullenly, in spattered brown,
 The cricket leaps the garden walk.

Within, the baby claps his hands
 And crows with rapture strange and vague;
Without, beneath the rosebush stands
 A dripping rooster on one leg.
