 DEAD! my wayward boy - my own -
 Not the Law's! but mine - the good
 God's free gift to me alone,
 Sanctified by motherhood.

 "Bad," you say: Well, who is not?
 "Brutal" - "with a heart of stone" -
 And "red-handed." - Ah! the hot
 Blood upon your own!

 I come not, with downward eyes,
 To plead for him shamedly, -
 God did not apologize
 When He gave the boy to me.

 Simply, I make ready now
 For His verdict. - You prepare -
 You have killed us both - and how
 Will you face us There!
