 O heart of mine, we shouldn't
Worry so!
 What we've missed of calm we couldn't
Have, you know!
 What we've met of stormy pain,
 And of sorrow's driving rain,
 We can better meet again,
If it blow!

 We have erred in that dark hour
We have known,
 When our tears fell with the shower,
All alone! -
 Were not shine and shadow blent
 As the gracious Master meant? -
 Let us temper our content
With His own.

 For, we know, not every morrow
Can be sad;
 So, forgetting all the sorrow
We have had,
 Let us fold away our fears,
 And put by our foolish tears,
 And through all the coming years
 Just be glad.
