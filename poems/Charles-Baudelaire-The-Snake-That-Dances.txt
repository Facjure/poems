title: The Snake That Dances
---

 How I love to watch, dear indolence,
like a bright shimmer,
of fabric, the skin of your elegant
body glimmer!

Over the bitter-tasting perfume,
the depths of your hair,
odorous, restless spume,
blue, and brown, waves, there,

like a vessel that stirs, awake
when dawn winds rise,
my dreaming soul sets sail
for those distant skies.

Your eyes where nothing�s revealed
either acrid or sweet,
are two cold jewels where steel
and gold both meet.

Seeing your rhythmic advance,
your fine abandon,
one might speak of a snake that danced
at the end of the branch it�s on.

Under its burden of languidness,
your head�s child-like slant,
rocks with weak listlessness
like a young elephant�s,

and your body heels and stretches
like some trim vessel
that rocking from side to side, plunges
its yards in the swell.

As when the groaning glacier�s thaw
fills the flowing stream,
so when your mouth�s juices pour
to the tip of your teeth,

I fancy I�m drinking overpowering, bitter,
Bohemian wine,
that over my heart will scatter
its stars, a liquid sky!
