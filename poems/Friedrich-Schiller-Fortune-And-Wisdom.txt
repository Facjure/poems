title: Fortune And Wisdom.

 Enraged against a quondam friend,
 To Wisdom once proud Fortune said
 "I'll give thee treasures without end,
 If thou wilt be my friend instead."

 "My choicest gifts to him I gave,
 And ever blest him with my smile;
 And yet he ceases not to crave,
 And calls me niggard all the while."

 "Come, sister, let us friendship vow!
 So take the money, nothing loth;
 Why always labor at the plough?
 Here is enough I'm sure for both!"

 Sage wisdom laughed, the prudent elf!
 And wiped her brow, with moisture hot:
 "There runs thy friend to hang himself,
 Be reconciled I need thee not!"
