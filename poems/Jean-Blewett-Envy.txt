title: Envy.
---

When Satan sends - to vex the mind of man
 And urge him on to meanness and to wrong - 
His satellites, there is not one that can
 Acquit itself like envy. Not so strong
As lust, so quick as fear, so big as hate - 
 A pigmy thing, the twin of sordid greed - 
Its work all noble things to underrate,
 Decry fair face, fair form, fair thought, fair deed,
A sneer it has for what is highest, best,
 For love's soft voice, and virtue's robe of white;
Truth is not true, and pity is not kind,
 A great task done is but a pastime light.
Tormented and tormenting is the mind
 That grants to envy room to make its nest.
