title: Sonnet - To One Poem In A Silent Time
---

Who looked for thee, thou little song of mine?
This winter of a silent poet's heart
Is suddenly sweet with thee, but what thou art,
Mid-winter flower, I would I could divine.

Art thou a last one, orphan of thy line?
Did the dead summer's last warmth foster thee?
Or is Spring folded up unguessed in me,
And stirring out of sight,-and thou the sign?

Where shall I look-backwards or to the morrow
For others of thy fragrance, secret child?
 Who knows if last things or if first things claim thee?

-Whether thou be the last smile of my sorrow,
Or else a joy too sweet, a joy too wild?
 How, my December violet, shall I name thee?
