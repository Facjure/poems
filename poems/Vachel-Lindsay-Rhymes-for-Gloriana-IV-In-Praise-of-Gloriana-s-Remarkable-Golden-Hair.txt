---

 The gleaming head of one fine friend
 Is bent above my little song,
 So through the treasure-pits of Heaven
 In fancy's shoes, I march along.

 I wander, seek and peer and ponder
 In Splendor's last ensnaring lair - 
 'Mid burnished harps and burnished crowns
 Where noble chariots gleam and flare:

 Amid the spirit-coins and gems,
 The plates and cups and helms of fire - 
 The gorgeous-treasure-pits of Heaven - 
 Where angel-misers slake desire!

 O endless treasure-pits of gold
 Where silly angel-men make mirth - 
 I think that I am there this hour,
 Though walking in the ways of earth!
