TO D. M. M.


Greeks once sang a lovely song
To their maiden Cora;
But my lay floats soft along
To my Dainty Dora.

Frenchmen sing of Anne Belle,
Romans sang of Flora;
But I sing my song to tell
Of my Dainty Dora.

Scotchmen sing their songs to move
Mary or Debora;
But I sing my song of love - 
Love for Dainty Dora.

Poets now a song may give
Psyche or Lenora;
But I'll sing long as I live
Just for Dainty Dora!
