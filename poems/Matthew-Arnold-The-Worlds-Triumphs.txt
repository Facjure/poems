title: The World�s Triumphs
---

So far as I conceive the World�s rebuke
To him address�d who would recast her new,
Not from herself her fame of strength she took,
But from their weakness, who would work her rue.
�Behold,� she cries, �so many rages lull�d,
So many fiery spirits quite cool�d down:
Look how so many valours, long undull�d,
After short commerce with me, fear my frown.
Thou too, when thou against my crimes wouldst cry,
Let thy foreboded homage check thy tongue.�
The World speaks well: yet might her foe reply
�Are wills so weak? then let not mine wait long.
Hast thou so rare a poison? let me be
Keener to slay thee, lest thou poison me.
