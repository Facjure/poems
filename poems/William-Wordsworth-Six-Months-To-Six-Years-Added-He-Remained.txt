title: Six Months To Six Years Added He Remained
---

 Six months to six years added he remained
 Upon this sinful earth, by sin unstained:
 O blessed Lord! whose mercy then removed
 A Child whom every eye that looked on loved;
 Support us, teach us calmly to resign
 What we possessed, and now is wholly thine!
