title: Look-out Mountain. The Night Fight.

 (November, 1863.)


 Who inhabiteth the Mountain
 That it shines in lurid light,
 And is rolled about with thunders,
 And terrors, and a blight,
 Like Kaf the peak of Eblis - 
 Kaf, the evil height?
 Who has gone up with a shouting
 And a trumpet in the night?

 There is battle in the Mountain - 
 Might assaulteth Might;
 'Tis the fastness of the Anarch,
 Torrent-torn, an ancient height;
 The crags resound the clangor
 Of the war of Wrong and Right;
 And the armies in the valley
 Watch and pray for dawning light.

 Joy, Joy, the day is breaking,
 And the cloud is rolled from sight;
 There is triumph in the Morning
 For the Anarch's plunging flight;
 God has glorified the Mountain
 Where a Banner burneth bright,
 And the armies in the valley
 They are fortified in right.
