God has kept me, dearest mother.
Kindly, safely, through the day:
Let me thank Him for His goodness,
Ere the twilight fades away.

For my home and friends I thank Him,
For my father, mother dear;
For the hills, the trees, the flowers,
And the sky so bright and clear.

If I have been kind and gentle,
If I've spoken what was true,
Or if I've been cross and selfish,
He has seen and known it, too.

Those I love He will watch over,
Though they may be far away,
For he loves good little children,
And will hear the words they say.
