[W.W.]


 A little maid, of summers four - 
Did you compute her years, - 
 And yet how infinitely more
To me her age appears:

 I mark the sweet child's serious air,
At her unplayful play, - 
 The tiny doll she mothers there
And lulls to sleep away,

 Grows - 'neath the grave similitude - 
An infant real, to me,
 And she a saint of motherhood
In hale maturity.

 So, pausing in my lonely round,
And all unseen of her,
 I stand uncovered - her profound
And abject worshipper.
