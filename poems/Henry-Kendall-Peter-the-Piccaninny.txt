title: Peter the Piccaninny
---

He has a name which can�t be brought
Within the sphere of metre;
But, as he�s Peter by report,
I�ll trot him out as Peter.

I call him mine; but don�t suppose
That I�m his dad, O reader!
My wife has got a Norman nose
She reads the tales of Ouida.

I never loved a nigger belle
My tastes are too aesthetic!
The perfume from a gin is well,
A rather strong emetic.

But, seeing that my theme is Pete,
This verse will be the neater
If I keep on the proper beat,
And stick throughout to Peter.

We picked him up the Lord knows where!
At noon we came across him
Asleep beside a hunk of bear
His paunch was bulged with �possum.

(Last stanza will not bear, I own,
A pressure analytic;
But bard whose weight is fourteen stone,
Is apt to thump the critic.)

We asked the kid to give his name:
He didn�t seem too willing
The darkey played the darkey�s game
We tipped him with a shilling!

We tipped him with a shining bob
No Tommy Dodd, believe us.
We didn�t �tumble� to his job
Ah, why did Pete deceive us!

I, being, as I�ve said, a bard,
Resolved at once to foster
This mite whose length was just a yard
This portable impostor!

�This babe� I spoke in Wordsworth�s tone
(See Wordsworth�s �Lucy�, neighbour)
�I�ll make a darling of my own;
And he�ll repay my labour.

�He�ll grow as gentle as a fawn
As quiet as the blossoms
That beautify a land of lawn
He�ll eat no more opossums.

�The child I to myself will take
In a paternal manner;
And ah! he will not swallow snake
In future, or �goanna�.

�Will you reside with me, my dear?�
I asked in accents mellow
The nigger grinned from ear to ear,
And said, �All right, old fellow!�

And so my Pete was taken home
My pretty piccaninny!
And, not to speak of soap or comb,
His cleansing cost a guinea.

�But hang expenses!� I exclaimed,
�I�ll give him education:
A �nig� is better when he�s tamed,
Perhaps, than a Caucasian.

�Ethnologists are in the wrong
About our sable brothers;
And I intend to stop the song
Of Pickering and others.�

Alas, I didn�t do it though!
Old Pickering�s conclusions
Were to the point, as issues show,
And mine were mere delusions.

My inky pet was clothed and fed
For months exceeding forty;
But to the end, it must be said,
His ways were very naughty.

When told about the Land of Morn
Above this world of Mammon,
He�d shout, with an emphatic scorn,
�Ah, gammon, gammon, gammon!�

He never lingered, like the bard,
To sniff at rose expanding.
�Me like,� he said, �em cattle-yard
Fine smell de smell of branding!�

The soul of man, I tried to show,
Went up beyond our vision.
�You ebber see dat fellow go?�
He asked in sheer derision.

In short, it soon occurred to me
This kid of six or seven,
Who wouldn�t learn his A B C,
Was hardly ripe for heaven.

He never lost his appetite
He bigger grew, and bigger;
And proved, with every inch of height,
A nigger is a nigger.

And, looking from this moment back,
I have a strong persuasion
That, after all, a finished black
Is not the �clean� Caucasian.

Dear Peter from my threshold went,
One morning in the body:
He �dropped� me, to oblige a gent
A gent with spear and waddy!

He shelved me for a boomerang
We never had a quarrel;
And, if a moral here doth hang,
Why let it hang the moral!

My mournful tale its course has run
My Pete, when last I spied him,
Was eating �possum underdone:
He had his gin beside him.
