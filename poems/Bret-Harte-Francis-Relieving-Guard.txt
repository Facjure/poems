Thomas Starr King. Obiit March 4, 1864


Came the relief. �What, sentry, ho!
How passed the night through thy long waking?�
�Cold, cheerless, dark, as may befit
The hour before the dawn is breaking.�

�No sight? no sound?� �No; nothing save
The plover from the marshes calling,
And in yon western sky, about
An hour ago, a star was falling.�

�A star? There�s nothing strange in that.�
�No, nothing; but, above the thicket,
Somehow it seemed to me that God
Somewhere had just relieved a picket.�
