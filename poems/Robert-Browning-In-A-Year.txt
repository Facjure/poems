I.
Never any more,
While I live,
Need I hope to see his face
As before.
Once his love grown chill,
Mine may strive 
Bitterly we re-embrace,
Single still.

II.
Was it something said,
Something done,
Vexed him? was it touch of hand,
Turn of head?
Strange! that very way
Love begun:
I as little understand
Love�s decay.

III.
When I sewed or drew,
I recall
How he looked as if I sung,
Sweetly too.
If I spoke a word,
First of all
Up his cheek the colour sprang,
Then he heard.

IV.
Sitting by my side,
At my feet,
So he breathed but air I breathed,
Satisfied!
I, too, at love�s brim
Touched the sweet:
I would die if death bequeathed
Sweet to him.

V.
�Speak, I love thee best!�
He exclaimed:
�Let thy love my own foretell!�
I confessed:
�Clasp my heart on thine
Now unblamed,
Since upon thy soul as well
Hangeth mine!�

VI.
Was it wrong to own,
Being truth?
Why should all the giving prove
His alone?
I had wealth and ease,
Beauty, youth 
Since my lover gave me love,
I gave these.

VII.
That was all I meant,
To be just,
And the passion I had raised,
To content.
Since he chose to change
Gold for dust,
If I gave him what he praised
Was it strange?

VIII.
Would he loved me yet,
On and on,
While I found some way undreamed
Paid my debt!
Gave more life and more,
Till, all gone,
He should smile �She never seemed
Mine before.

IX.
�What, she felt the while,
Must I think?
Love�s so different with us men!�
He should smile:
�Dying for my sake 
White and pink!
Can�t we touch these bubbles then
But they break?�

X.
Dear, the pang is brief,
Do thy part,
Have thy pleasure! How perplext
Grows belief!
Well, this cold clay clod
Was man�s heart:
Crumble it and what comes next?
Is it God?
