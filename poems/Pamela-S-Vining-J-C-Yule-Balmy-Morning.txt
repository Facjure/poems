Balmy morning! blessed morning!
Dew-drops bright
All the emerald glade adorning
In thy light - 
In thy golden glowing beam
With an ever-changeful gleam
Flashing sparkling deeply glowing
Varying tints of beauty showing
Everywhere
Radiant are
In thy welcome light!

Balmy morning! blessed morning!
Flowers look up,
With a precious, pearly off'ring,
In each cup - 
Dewy off'ring gleaned by night,
As a tribute to the light, - 
Far more precious than the gem
Of a monarch's diadem,
Is the gift
Which they lift
To thy welcome light!

Balmy morning! blessed morning!
Sounds of mirth,
From the vocal vales ascending,
Hail thy birth.
Happy birds in echoing bowers,
Waken all their tuneful powers,
And spontaneous music springs
From all animated things, - 
Verdant hills,
Tuneful rills,
Joyful greet thy light!

Balmy morning! blessed morning!
How serene,
In thy calm and cloudless dawning
Smiles the scene!
Even man, by care oppressed,
Feels thy gladness thrill his breast,
Hails thee as a source of bliss,
Precious in a world like this,
Gratefully
Blessing thee - 
Welcome, morning light!
