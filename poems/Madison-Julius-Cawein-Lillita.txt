Can I forget how, when you stood
 'Mid orchards whence spring bloom had fled,
Stars made the orchards seem a-bud,
 And weighed the sighing boughs o'erhead
 With shining ghosts of blossoms dead!

Or when you bowed, a lily tall,
 Above your August lilies slim,
Transparent pale, that by the wall
 Like softest moonlight seemed to swim,
 Brimmed with faint fragrance to the brim.

And in the cloud that lingered low - 
 A silent pallor in the West - 
There stirred and beat a golden glow
 Of some great heart that could not rest,
 A heart of gold within its breast.

Your heart, your life was in the wild,
 Your joy to hear the whip-poor-will
Lament its love, when wafted mild
 The harvest drifted from the hill:
The deep, deep wildwood where had trod
 The red deer o'er the fallen hush
Of Fall's torn leaves, when the low tod
 Was frosty 'neath each berried bush.

At dusk the whip-will still complains
 Above your lolling lilies, where
Their faces white the moonlight stains,
 The dreamy stream flows far and fair
 Whisp'ring of rest an easeful air ...

O music of the falling rain,
 At night unto her painless rest
Sound sweet and sad, then is she fain
 To see the wild flowers on her breast
Lift moist, pure faces up again
 To breathe to God their fragrance blest.
Thick-pleated beeches long have crossed
 Old, mighty arms above her tomb
Where oft I watch at night her ghost
 Bow to the wild-flower's full-blown bloom
A mist of curls, where Summer lost
 Her tangled sunbeams and perfume.
