title: Dwell Not With Me
---

Dwell, not with me,
For you�ll never see
More than a �possum or a kangaroo,
And now and then a cockatoo.

Oh, would you wish,
Without a dish,
Your scanty meal from a piece of bark,
And a wood fire to illume the dark.

�Tis there you�d mourn,
�Tis there you�d mourn
The sweet woodbine
That round your lattice now doth twine.

Fond friends, don�t grieve
For scenes like these,
Or smart from bugs, mosquitoes, fleas.
Dwell not with me.
