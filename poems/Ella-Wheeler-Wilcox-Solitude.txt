Laugh, and the world laughs with you:
Weep, and you weep alone;
 For the sad old earth
 Must borrow its mirth,
It has trouble enough of its own.

Sing, and the hills will answer;
Sigh, it is lost on the air;
 The echoes bound
 To a joyful sound,
But shrink from voicing care.

Rejoice, and men will seek you;
Grieve, and they turn and go;
 They want full measure
 Of all your pleasure,
But they do not want your woe.

Be glad, and your friends are many;
Be sad, and you lose them all;
 There are none to decline
 Your nectared wine,
But alone you must drink life's gall.

Feast, and your halls are crowded;
Fast, and the world goes by;
 Succeed and give,
 And it helps you live,
But it cannot help you die.

There is room in the halls of pleasure
For a long and lordly train;
 But one by one
 We must all file on
Through the narrow aisles of pain.
