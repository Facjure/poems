The boarder in the bar-room rose,
A pale gaunt man who lodged with Hann,
�I bear,� he said, �the worst of woes,
And suffer torments no one knows,
For do my best I never can
Have sleep like any other man.

�I have insomnia,� said he.
�At times it drives me mad outright.
Whate�er I do, where�er I be,
Its just the same, so sleep for me.
You won�t believe for three years quite
I haven�t slept two hours a night.�

Boss-cocky Billson softly swore,
And turning from his chestnut cob.
�What�s that?� he questioned from the door.
�You say that you don�t sleep no more
Than two hours? I pay thirty bob.
Now, mister, do you want a job?�
