 O life! without thy chequered scene
 Of right and wrong, of weal and woe,
 Success and failure, could a ground
 For magnanimity be found;
 For faith, 'mid ruined hopes, serene?
 Or whence could virtue flow?

 Pain entered through a ghastly breach
 Nor while sin lasts must effort cease;
 Heaven upon earth's an empty boast;
 But, for the bowers of Eden lost,
 Mercy has placed within our reach
 A portion of God's peace.
