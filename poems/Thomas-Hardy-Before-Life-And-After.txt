title: Before Life And After
---

 A time there was - as one may guess
And as, indeed, earth's testimonies tell -
 Before the birth of consciousness,
 When all went well.

 None suffered sickness, love, or loss,
None knew regret, starved hope, or heart-burnings;
 None cared whatever crash or cross
 Brought wrack to things.

 If something ceased, no tongue bewailed,
If something winced and waned, no heart was wrung;
 If brightness dimmed, and dark prevailed,
 No sense was stung.

 But the disease of feeling germed,
And primal rightness took the tinct of wrong;
 Ere nescience shall be reaffirmed
 How long, how long?
