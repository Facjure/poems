 Cean duv deelish, beside the sea
 I stand and stretch my hands to thee
 Across the world.
 The riderless horses race to shore
 With thundering hoofs and shuddering, hoar,
 Blown manes uncurled.

 Cean duv deelish, I cry to thee
 Beyond the world, beneath the sea,
 Thou being dead.
 Where hast thou hidden from the beat
 Of crushing hoofs and tearing feet
 Thy dear black head?

 Cean duv deelish, �tis hard to pray
 With breaking heart from day to day,
 And no reply;
 When the passionate challenge of sky is cast
 In the teeth of the sea and an angry blast
 Goes by.

 God bless the woman, whoever she be,
 From the tossing waves will recover thee
 And lashing wind.
 Who will take thee out of the wind and storm,
 Dry thy wet face on her bosom warm
 And lips so kind?

 I not to know.It is hard to pray,
 But I shall for this woman from day to day,
 �Comfort my dead,
 The sport of the winds and the play of the sea.�
 I loved thee too well for this thing to be,
 O dear black head!
