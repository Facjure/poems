The trees fret fitfully and twist,
Shutters rattle and carpets heave,
Slime is the dust of yestereve,
And in the streaming mist
Fishes might seem to fin a passage if they list.

 But to his feet,
 Drawing nigh and nigher
 A hidden seat,
 The fog is sweet
 And the wind a lyre.

A vacant sameness grays the sky,
A moisture gathers on each knop
Of the bramble, rounding to a drop,
That greets the goer-by
With the cold listless lustre of a dead man's eye.

 But to her sight,
 Drawing nigh and nigher
 Its deep delight,
 The fog is bright
 And the wind a lyre.
