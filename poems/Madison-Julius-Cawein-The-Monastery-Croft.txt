Big-stomached, like friars
 Who ogle a nun,
Quaff deep to their bellies' desires
 From the old abbey's tun,
Grapes fatten with fires
 Warm-filtered from moon and from sun.

As a novice who muses,
 Lips a rosary tell,
While her thoughts are - a love she refuses?
 Nay! mourns as not well:
The ripe apple looses
 Its holding to rot where it fell.
