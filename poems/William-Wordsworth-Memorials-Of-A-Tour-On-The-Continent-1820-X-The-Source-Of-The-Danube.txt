---

 Not, like his great Compeers, indignantly
 Doth Danube spring to life! The wandering Stream
 (Who loves the Cross, yet to the Crescent's gleam
 Unfolds a willing breast) with infant glee
 Slips from his prison walls: and Fancy, free
 To follow in his track of silver light,
 Mounts on rapt wing, and with a moment's flight
 Hath reached the encincture of that gloomy sea
 Whose waves the Orphean lyre forbade to meet
 In conflict; whose rough winds forgot their jars
 To waft the heroic progeny of Greece;
 When the first Ship sailed for the Golden Fleece
 Argo, exalted for that daring feat
 To fix in heaven her shape distinct with stars.
