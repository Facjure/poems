'Kiss me, dear Love!' -
But there was none to hear,
Only the darkness round about my bed
And hollow silence, for thy face had fled,
Though in my dreaming it had come so near.

I slept again and it came back to me,
Burning within the hollow arch of night
Like some fair flame of sacrificial light,
And all my soul sprang up to mix with thee -
'Kiss me, my love!
Ah, Love, thy face how fair!'
So did I cry, but still thou wert not there.
