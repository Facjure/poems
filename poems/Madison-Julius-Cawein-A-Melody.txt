 I.

There be Fairies bright of eye,
 Who the wild-flowers warders are;
There be Fairies subtlely
 Nourished in a blossom's star;
Fairies tripping merrily
 Singing in faint echoes far,
Singing fairy melodies
Murmured by the burly bees,
 By the wild brown bees.


 II.

Well I wot that Fairies be there, - 
 Fairies, Fairies that at eve
Lurking in a blossom-lair,
In some rose-bud's scented hair
 From white beams of starlight weave
Glinting gown and shining shoe.
I have proven sure and true
Fairies be there, fays of dew,
Lying laughing in its spark
Floating in a rose's sark;
Singing fairy melodies,
When asleep the dusty bees
Can not steal their melodies,
 Fairy melodies.
