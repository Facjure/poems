 Twinkum, twankum, twirlum and twitch
 My great grandam - She was a Witch.
 Mouse in wainscot, Saint in niche - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch;
 Deadly nightshade flowers in a ditch - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch;
 Long though the shroud it grows stitch by stitch - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch;
 Wean your weakling before you breech - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch;
 The fattest pig's but a double flitch - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch;
 Nightjars rattle, owls scritch - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch.

Pretty and small,
A mere nothing at all,
Pinned up sharp in the ghost of a shawl,
She'd straddle her down to the kirkyard wall,
And mutter and whisper and call; and call - 
And - call.

 Red blood out and black blood in,
 My Nannie says I'm a child of sin - 
 How did I choose me my witchcraft kin!
 Know I as soon as dark's dreams begin
 Snared is my heart in a nightmare's gin;
 Never from terror I out may win;
 So dawn and dusk I pine, peak, thin,
 Scarcely beknowing t'other from which - 
 My great grandam - She was a Witch.
