title: A St. Valentine's Day Tragedy

Oh! Montmorency Vere de Vere,
To think that one I held so dear
Should use a base deceiverï¿½s art
To trifle with my loving heart.

A brand new ten-cent valentine
With lace and hearts and verses fine,
I sent to show my love for thee
And in return you send to me
The one I sent to you last year,
Oh! Montmorency Vere de Vere.
