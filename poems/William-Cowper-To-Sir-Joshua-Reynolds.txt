Dear President, whose art sublime
Gives perpetuity to time,
And bids transactions of a day,
That fleeting hours would waft away
To dark futurity, survive,
And in unfading beauty live,�
You cannot with a grace decline
A special mandate of the Nine�
Yourself, whatever task you choose,
So much indebted to the Muse.
Thus say the sisterhood:�We come�
Fix well your pallet on your thumb,
Prepare the pencil and the tints�
We come to furnish you with hints.
French disappointment, British glory,
Must be the subject of the story.
First strike a curve, a graceful bow,
Then slope it to a point below;
Your outline easy, airy, light,
Fill�d up becomes a paper kite.
Let independence, sanguine, horrid,
Blaze like a meteor in the forehead:
Beneath (but lay aside your graces)
Draw six-and-twenty rueful faces,
Each with a staring, stedfast eye,
Fix�d on his great and good ally.
France flies the kite��tis on the wing�
Britannia�s lightning cuts the string.
The wind that raised it, ere it ceases,
Just rends it into thirteen pieces,
Takes charge of every fluttering sheet,
And lays them all at George�s feet.
Iberia, trembling from afar,
Renounces the confederate war.
Her efforts and her arts o�ercome,
France calls her shatter�d navies home,
Repenting Holland learns to mourn
The sacred treaties she has torn;
Astonishment and awe profound
Are stamp�d upon the nations round:
Without one friend, above all foes,
Britannia gives the world repose.
