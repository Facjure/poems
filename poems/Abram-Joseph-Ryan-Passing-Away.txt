Life's Vesper-bells are ringing
 In the temple of my heart,
And yon sunset, sure, is singing
 "Nunc dimittis -- Now depart!"
Ah! the eve is golden-clouded,
 But to-morrow's sun shall shine
On this weary body shrouded;
 But my soul doth not repine.

"Let me see the sun descending,
 I will see his light no more,
For my life, this eve, is ending;
 And to-morrow on the shore
That is fair, and white, and golden,
 I will meet my God; and ye
Will forget not all the olden,
 Happy hours ye spent with me.

"I am glad that I am going;
 What a strange and sweet delight
Is thro' all my being flowing
 When I know that, sure, to-night
I will pass from earth and meet Him
 Whom I loved thro' all the years,
Who will crown me when I greet Him,
 And will kiss away my tears.

"My last sun! haste! hurry westward!
 In the dark of this to-night
My poor soul that hastens rest-ward
 `With the Lamb' will find the light;
Death is coming -- and I hear him,
 Soft and stealthy cometh he;
But I do not believe I fear him,
 God is now so close to me."

 *****

Fell the daylight's fading glimmer
 On a face so wan and white;
Brighter was his soul, while dimmer
 Grew the shadows of the night;
And he died -- and God was near him;
 I knelt by him to forgive;
And I sometimes seem to hear him
 Whisper -- "Live as I did live."
