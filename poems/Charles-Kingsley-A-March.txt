 Dreary East winds howling o'er us;
 Clay-lands knee-deep spread before us;
 Mire and ice and snow and sleet;
 Aching backs and frozen feet;
 Knees which reel as marches quicken,
 Ranks which thin as corpses thicken;
 While with carrion birds we eat,
 Calling puddle-water sweet,
As we pledge the health of our general, who fares as rough as we:
What can daunt us, what can turn us, led to death by such as he?

Eversley, 1848.
