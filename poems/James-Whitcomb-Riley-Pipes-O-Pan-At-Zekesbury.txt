title: Pipes O' Pan At Zekesbury
---

 The pipes of Pan! Not idler now are they
 Than when their cunning fashioner first blew
 The pith of music from them: Yet for you
 And me their notes are blown in many a way
 Lost in our murmurings for that old day
 That fared so well, without us. - Waken to
 The pipings here at hand: - The clear halloo
 Of truant-voices, and the roundelay
 The waters warble in the solitude
 Of blooming thickets, where the robin's breast
 Sends up such ecstacy o'er dale and dell,
 Each tree top answers, till in all the wood
 There lingers not one squirrel in his nest
 Whetting his hunger on an empty shell.
