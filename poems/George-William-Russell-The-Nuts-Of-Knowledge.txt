 'Sinend daughter of Lodan Lucharglan, son of Lir, out of the
 Land of Promise went to Connlas' Well which is under the
 sea, to behold it. That is a well at which are the hazels of
 wisdom and inspiration that is, the hazels of the science of
 poetry; and in the same hour their fruit and their blossom &amp;
 their foliage break forth, and then fall upon the well in
 the same shower, which raises upon the water a royal surge
 of purple.'
