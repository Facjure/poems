Down Wessex way, when spring's a-shine,
 The blackbird's "pret-ty de-urr!"
In Wessex accents marked as mine
 Is heard afar and near.

He flutes it strong, as if in song
 No R's of feebler tone
Than his appear in "pretty dear,"
 Have blackbirds ever known.

Yet they pipe "prattie deerh!" I glean,
 Beneath a Scottish sky,
And "pehty de-aw!" amid the treen
 Of Middlesex or nigh.

While some folk say - perhaps in play -
 Who know the Irish isle,
'Tis "purrity dare!" in treeland there
 When songsters would beguile.

Well: I'll say what the listening birds
 Say, hearing "pret-ty de-urr!" -
However strangers sound such words,
 That's how we sound them here.

Yes, in this clime at pairing time,
 As soon as eyes can see her
At dawn of day, the proper way
 To call is "pret-ty de-urr!"
