Above the clouds I sail, above the clouds,
 And wish my mind
Above its clouds could climb as well,
 And leave behind
The world and all its crowds,
 And ever dwell
In such a calm and limpid solitude
With ne'er a breath unkind or harsh or rude
 To break the spell - 
With ne'er a thought to drive away
The golden splendour of the day.
Alone and lost beneath the tranquil blue,
 My God! With you!

 Written in an Aeroplane.
