 'The oppression of the tumult, wrath and scorn
 The tribulation and the gleaming blades'
 Such is the impetuous spirit that pervades
 The song of Taliesin; Ours shall mourn
 The 'unarmed' Host who by their prayers would turn
 The sword from Bangor's walls, and guard the store
 Of Aboriginal and Roman lore,
 And Christian monuments, that now must burn
 To senseless ashes. Mark! how all things swerve
 From their known course, or vanish like a dream;
 Another language spreads from coast to coast;
 Only perchance some melancholy Stream
 And some indignant Hills old names preserve,
 When laws, and creeds, and people all are lost!
