title: The Day Is Done
---

The day ban done, and darkness
 Falling from vengs of night,
Lak fedder flying from ruster,
 Ven he ban having fight.
Ay see the lights of willage
 Shining tru rain and mist,
And ay skol feel dam sleepy,
 Lak fallers playing whist.

Come, read tu me some werses,
 Ay ant care vat yu read,
Yust so it ant 'bout trouble
 Or hearts vich ache and bleed.
Ay lak dese har nice yingles
 'Bout sun and trees and grass;
But, ven it com to heartache,
 Yerusalem! ay skol pass!

Read from some humble geezer,
 Whose songs ban sveet to hear - 
Who making, from his poetry,
 'Bout saxteen cents a year.
Ay lak to hear his yingles,
 Ay tell yu, dey ban fine;
Dis har ban vy ay lak dem - 
 Dey ban so much lak mine.

Such songs have gude, nice sound - 
 Dey making sorrow fly;
Dey coming lak glass of seltzer
 Vich follows drenk of rye.
And night skol be full of music,
 And tengs we lak to forget
Skol fold op tents lak yipsies,
 And sneaking avay, yu bet!
