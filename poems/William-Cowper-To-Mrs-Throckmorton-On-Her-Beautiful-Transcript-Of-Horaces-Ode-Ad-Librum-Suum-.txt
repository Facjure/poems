title: To Mrs. Throckmorton, On Her Beautiful Transcript Of Horace�s Ode, �Ad Librum Suum.�
---

Maria, could Horace have guess�d
What honour awaited his ode
To his own little volume address�d,
The honour which you have bestow�d;
Who have traced it in characters here,
So elegant, even, and neat,
He had laugh�d at the critical sneer
Which he seems to have trembled to meet.


And sneer, if you please, he had said,
A nymph shall hereafter arise,
Who shall give me, when you are all dead,
The glory your malice denies;
Shall dignity give to my lay,
Although but a mere bagatelle;
And even a poet shall say,
Nothing ever was written so well.
