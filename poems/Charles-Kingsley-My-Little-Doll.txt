I once had a sweet little doll, dears,
 The prettiest doll in the world;
Her cheeks were so red and so white, dears,
 And her hair was so charmingly curled.
But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
 As I played in the heath one day;
And I cried for more than a week, dears,
 But I never could find where she lay.

I found my poor little doll, dears,
 As I played in the heath one day:
Folks say she is terribly changed, dears,
 For her paint is all washed away,
And her arms trodden off by the cows, dears
 And her hair not the least bit curled:
Yet for old sakes' sake she is still, dears,
 The prettiest doll in the world.

From The Water-Babies.
Eversley, 1862.
