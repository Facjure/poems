---

 By antique Fancy trimmed, though lowly, bred
 To dignity in thee, O Schwytz! are seen
 The genuine features of the golden mean;
 Equality by Prudence governed,
 Or jealous Nature ruling in her stead;
 And, therefore, art thou blest with peace, serene
 As that of the sweet fields and meadows green
 In unambitious compass round thee spread.
 Majestic Berne, high on her guardian steep,
 Holding a central station of command,
 Might well be styled this noble body's Head;
 Thou, lodged 'mid mountainous entrenchments deep,
 Its heart; and ever may the heroic Land
 Thy name, O Schwytz, in happy freedom keep!
