Mira quel colle, o stanco mio cor vago.

HE BIDS HIS HEART RETURN TO LAURA, NOT PERCEIVING THAT IT HAD NEVER LEFT HER.


P. Look on that hill, my fond but harass'd heart!
 Yestreen we left her there, who 'gan to take
 Some care of us and friendlier looks to dart;
 Now from our eyes she draws a very lake:
 Return alone--I love to be apart--
 Try, if perchance the day will ever break
 To mitigate our still increasing smart,
 Partner and prophet of my lifelong ache.
H. O wretch! in whom vain thoughts and idle swell,
 Thou, who thyself hast tutor'd to forget,
 Speak'st to thy heart as if 'twere with thee yet?
 When to thy greatest bliss thou saidst farewell,
 Thou didst depart alone: it stay'd with her,
 Nor cares from those bright eyes, its home, to stir.

MACGREGOR.
