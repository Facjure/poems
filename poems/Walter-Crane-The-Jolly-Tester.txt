1

O dear Six-pence, I've got Six-pence,
I love Six-pence as I love my life;
I'll spend a penny on't, and I'll lend another on't,
And I'll carry fourpence home to my wife.

2

O dear Four-pence, I've got Four-pence,
I love Four-pence as I love my life;
I'll spend a penny on't, and I'll lend another on't,
And I'll carry two-pence home to my wife.

3

O dear Two-pence, I've got Two-pence,
I love Two-pence as I love my life;
I'll spend a penny on't, and I'll lend a penny on't,
And I'll carry nothing home to my wife.

4

O dear nothing, I've got nothing,
What will nothing buy for my wife?
I have nothing, I spend nothing,
I love nothing better than my wife.
