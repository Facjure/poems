title: The Swallow

 Swift goes the sooty swallow o'er the heath,
 Swifter than skims the cloud-rack of the skies;
 As swiftly flies its shadow underneath,
 And on his wing the twittering sunbeam lies,
 As bright as water glitters in the eyes
 Of those it passes; 'tis a pretty thing,
 The ornament of meadows and clear skies:
 With dingy breast and narrow pointed wing,
 Its daily twittering is a song to Spring.
