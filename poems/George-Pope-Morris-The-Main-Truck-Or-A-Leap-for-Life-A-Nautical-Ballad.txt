[Founded upon a well-known tale from the pen of the late William Leggett, Esq.]




Old Ironsides at anchor lay,
 In the harbor of Mahon;
A dead calm rested on the bay--
 The waves to sleep had gone;
When little Jack, the captain's son,
 With gallant hardihood,
Climbed shroud and spar--and then upon
 The main-truck rose and stood!

A shudder ran through every vein--
 All eyes were turned on high!
There stood the boy, with dizzy brain,
 Between the sea and sky!
No hold had he above--below,
 Alone he stood in air!
At that far height none dared to go--
 No aid could reach him there.

We gazed--but not a man could speak!--
 With horror all aghast
In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,
 We watched the quivering mast.
The atmosphere grew thick and hot,
 And of a lurid hue,
As, riveted unto the spot,
 Stood officers and crew.

The father came on deck--He gasped,
 "O, God, Thy will be done!"
Then suddenly a rifle grasped,
 And aimed it at his son!
"Jump far out, boy! into the wave!
 Jump, or I fire!" he said:
"That only chance your life can save!
 Jump--jump, boy!"--He obeyed.

He sank--he rose--he lived--he moved--
 He for the ship struck out!
On board we hailed the lad beloved
 With many a manly shout.
His father drew, in silent joy,
 Those wet arms round his neck,
Then folded to his heart the boy
 And fainted on the deck!
