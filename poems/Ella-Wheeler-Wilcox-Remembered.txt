His art was loving; Eres set his sign
 Upon that youthful forehead, and he drew
The hearts of women, as the sun draws dew.
Love feeds love's thirst as wine feeds love of wine;
Nor is there any potion from the vine
 Which makes men drunken like the subtle brew
 Of kisses crushed by kisses; and he grew
Inebriated with that draught divine.

Yet in his sober moments, when the sun
 Of radiant summer paled to lonely fall,
And passion's sea had grown an ebbing tide,
From out the many, Memory singled one
 Full cup that seemed the sweetest of them all - 
The warm red mouth that mocked him and denied.
