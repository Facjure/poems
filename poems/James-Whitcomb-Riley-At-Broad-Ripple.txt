 Ah, Luxury! Beyond the heat
 And dust of town, with dangling feet,
 Astride the rock below the dam,
 In the cool shadows where the calm
 Rests on the stream again, and all
 Is silent save the waterfall, -
 bait my hook and cast my line,
 And feel the best of life is mine.

 No high ambition may I claim -
 angle not for lordly game
 Of trout, or bass, or wary bream -
 black perch reaches the extreme
 Of my desires; and "goggle-eyes"
 Are not a thing that I despise;
 A sunfish, or a "chub," or "cat" -
 A "silver-side" - yea, even that!

 In eloquent tranquility
 The waters lisp and talk to me.
 Sometimes, far out, the surface breaks,
 As some proud bass an instant shakes
 His glittering armor in the sun,
 And romping ripples, one by one,
 Come dallying across the space
 Where undulates my smiling face.

 The river's story flowing by,
 Forever sweet to ear and eye,
 Forever tenderly begun -
 Forever new and never done.
 Thus lulled and sheltered in a shade
 Where never feverish cares invade,
 I bait my hook and cast my line,
 And feel the best of life is mine.
