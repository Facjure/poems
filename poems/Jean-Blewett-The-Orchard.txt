There's no garden like an orchard,
 Nature shows no fairer thing
Than the apple trees in blossom
 In these late days o' the spring.

Here the robin redbreast's nesting,
 Here, from golden dawn till night,
Honey bees are gaily swimming
 In a sea of pink and white.

Just a sea of fragrant blossoms,
 Steeped in sunshine, drenched in dew,
Just a fragrant breath which tells you
 Earth is fair again and new.

Just a breath of subtle sweetness,
 Breath which holds the spice o' youth,
Holds the promise o' the summer - 
 Holds the best o' things, forsooth.

There's no garden like an orchard,
 Nature shows no fairer thing
Than the apple trees in blossom
 In these late days o' the spring.
