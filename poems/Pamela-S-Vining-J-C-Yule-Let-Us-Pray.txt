Bow the head in supplication,
Lowly, penitent, sincere,
Worthiest of adoration,
God, the Holy One is here! - 
Here, while through the open casement
Gently beams the rising day,
While, in contrite self abasement,
Rev'rently we kneel and pray!

Let us pray! - we're weak and weary,
Faint of heart and slow of limb,
Over mountains dark and dreary
Lies our pathway - narrow, dim,
Thorn beset and demon-haunted,
Steep and slipp'ry is the way,
Would we tread it all undaunted,
Firm of footstep? - let us pray!

Let us pray! - on every spirit,
Secret, solemn records lie,
Of transgression and demerit,
On'y seen by God's pure eye, - 
Secret sins, desires unholy,
Thoughts impure that once held sway, - 
Oh, in penitence most lowly,
Deeply contrite, let us pray!

Let us pray! - we need forgiveness, - 
Strength and patience to endure, - 
For our arduous labors fitness, - 
Spirits consecrate and pure,
Shelter need when storms are round us, - 
Bread of Heavenly life each day, - 
Help when hidden snares surround us, - 
Guidance always - let us pray!
