title: Outlaws.

 Owls: they whinney down the night,
 Bats go zigzag by.
 Ambushed in shadow out of sight
 The outlaws lie.

 Old gods, shrunk to shadows, there
 In the wet woods they lurk,
 Greedy of human stuff to snare
 In webs of murk.

 Look up, else your eye must drown
 In a moving sea of black
 Between the tree-tops, upside down
 Goes the sky-track.

 Look up, else your feet will stray
 Towards that dim ambuscade,
 Where spider-like they catch their prey
 In nets of shade.

 For though creeds whirl away in dust,
 Faith fails and men forget,
 These aged gods of fright and lust
 Cling to life yet.

 Old gods almost dead, malign,
 Starved of their ancient dues,
 Incense and fruit, fire, blood and wine
 And an unclean muse.

 Banished to woods and a sickly moon,
 Shrunk to mere bogey things,
 Who spoke with thunder once at noon
 To prostrate kings.

 With thunder from an open sky
 To peasant, tyrant, priest,
 Bowing in fear with a dazzled eye
 Towards the East.

 Proud gods, humbled, sunk so low,
 Living with ghosts and ghouls,
 And ghosts of ghosts and last year's snow
 And dead toadstools.
