If Laura lady of the flower-soft face
Should light upon these verses, she may take
The tenderest line, and through its pulses trace
What man can suffer for a woman�s sake.
For in the nights that burn, the days that break,
A thin pale figure stands in Passion�s place,
And peace comes not, nor yet the perished grace
Of youth, to keep old faiths and fires awake.
Ah! marvellous maid. Life sobs, and sighing saith,
�She left me, fleeting like a fluttered dove;
But I would have a moment of her breath,
So I might taste the sweetest sense thereof,
And catch from blossoming, honeyed lips of love
Some faint, some fair, some dim, delicious death.�
