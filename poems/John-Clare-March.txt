[From HONE'S "Year Book"]

 The insect world, now sunbeams higher climb,
 Oft dream of Spring, and wake before their time:
 Bees stroke their little legs across their wings,
 And venture short flights where the snow-drop hings
 Its silver bell, and winter aconite
 Its buttercup-like flowers that shut at night,
 With green leaf furling round its cup of gold,
 Like tender maiden muffled from the cold:
 They sip and find their honey-dreams are vain,
 Then feebly hasten to their hives again.
 The butterflies, by eager hopes undone,
 Glad as a child come out to greet the sun,
 Beneath the shadows of a sunny shower
 Are lost, nor see to-morrow's April flower.
