READING THE STORY OF JOSEPH TO A SICK FATHER.

 Brother and sister are a-Maying gone;
 By my sick father's bed I watch alone;
 Light in the sun, from field to field they roam,
 To bring a cowslip-ball or May-thorn home;
 I sit and read of Joseph, in the land
 Of Egypt, when his guilty brothers stand
 Before him - but they know him not; aside
 He turns his face, the bursting tears to hide:
 Scarce to these words an utterance can he give;
 I am your brother Joseph! Doth he live,
 My father, the old man of whom ye speak?
 And tears are falling on my father's cheek.
 Though my loved mother rests among the dead,
 And pain and sickness visit this sad bed,
 We think not, whilst we turn the holy page,
 Of this vain world - of sorrow and of age!
 And oh, my father, I am blessed indeed,
 Blessed for your sake, that I have learned to read!
