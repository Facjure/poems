KAARE
What wakens the billows, while sleeps the wind?
 What looms in the west released?
What kindles the stars, ere day's declined,
 Like fires for death's dark feast?

 ALL
 God aid thee here, our earl,
 God aid thee here, our earl,
 It is Helga, who comes unto Orkney.

KAARE
What drives the fierce dragon to ride the foam,
 While billows with blood are red?
The sea-fowl are shrieking, they seek their home,
 And hover around my head.

 ALL
 God aid thee here, our earl,
 God aid thee here, our earl,
 It is Helga, who comes unto Orkney.

KAARE
What maiden so strange to the strand draws nigh,
 In light with soft music nears?
What is it that makes all the flowers die,
 What fills all your eyes with tears?

 ALL
 God aid thee here, our earl,
 God aid thee here, our earl,
 It is Helga, who comes unto Orkney.
