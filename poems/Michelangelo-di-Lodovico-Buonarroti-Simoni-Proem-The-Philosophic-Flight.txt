Poi che spiegate.


 Now that these wings to speed my wish ascend,
 The more I feel vast air beneath my feet,
 The more toward boundless air on pinions fleet,
 Spurning the earth, soaring to heaven, I tend:
 Nor makes them stoop their flight the direful end
 Of Daedal's son; but upward still they beat:--
 What life the while with my life can compete,
 Though dead to earth at last I shall descend?
 My own heart's voice in the void air I hear:
 Where wilt thou bear me, O rash man? Recall
 Thy daring will! This boldness waits on fear!
 Dread not, I answer, that tremendous fall:
 Strike through the clouds, and smile when death is near,
 If death so glorious be our doom at all!
