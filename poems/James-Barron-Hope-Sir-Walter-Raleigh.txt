Whether in velvet white, slashed, and be-pearled,
And rich in knots of clustering gems a-glow:
Or, in his rusted armor, he unfurled
St. George's Cross by Oronoko's flow;
He was a man to note right well as one
Who shot his arrows straightway at the sun.

Dark was his hair, his beard all crisp and curled.
And narrow-lidded were his piercing eyes,
Anhungered in their glances for a world
That he might win by daring enterprise, - 
Explorer, soldier, scholar, poet, he
Not only wrote but acted historie! - 
And that great Captain, of our Saxon stock,
Took his last slumber on the ghastly block!
