(NOVEMBER 4, 1864)

Norr�na-race's longing,
 It was the sea's free wave,
And fight of heroes thronging,
 And honor that it gave;
Their thoughts and deeds upspringing
 From roots in Surtr's fire,
With branches topward swinging
 To Yggdrasil aspire.

His course alone each guided,
 Oft brother-harm was done;
Our vict'ries were divided,
 The honor gained was one.
Each heard his call time-fated,
 First Norway, Denmark, came,
The Swede the longest waited,
 But greatest grew his fame.

In eastern, western regions
 The Danish dragons shone,
To Norway's roving legions
 Jerusalem was known.
From sparks the Swedish spirit
 Struck forth in Poland's night,
Through L�tzen must inherit
 Full half the world its light.

First Norseman, Dane, agreeing
 In trying times were found,
But Saga's will far-seeing
 By little men was bound;
Then Norseman, Swede, agreeing,
 Time in its fullness found,
And Saga's will far-seeing
 Shall nevermore be bound.

There is prophetic power
 In longing hearts of men,
Foretells our union's hour '
 For great deeds once again.
Each festival so glorious
 To solemn vows us draws:
Forever be victorious
 Our blood's, our race's cause!
