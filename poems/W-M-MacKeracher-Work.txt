Not to the Arch-Idler be the honor given
 Of first inventing work, but to his Lord,
Who made the light, the firmament of heaven,
 And sun and moon and planets in accord,
The land and cattle on it, and the sea
 And fish therein, and flying fowl in air,
And grass and herb and fair fruit-yielding tree,
 And man, His own similitude to wear;

Whose works are old and yet for ever new,
 Who all sustains with providential sway,
Whose Son, "My Father worketh hitherto
 And I work," said, and ere He went away,
"Finished the work thou gavest me to do,"
 And unto us, "Work ye while it is day."
