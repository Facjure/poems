title: A Mother-Song
---

 Mother, O mother! forever I cry for you,
Sing the old song I may never forget;
 Even in slumber I murmur and sigh for you. -
Mother, O mother,
Sing low, "Little brother,
 Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!"

 Mother, O mother! the years are so lonely,
Filled but with weariness, doubt and regret!
 Can't you come back to me - for to-night only,
Mother, my mother,
And sing, "Little brother,
 Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!"

 Mother, O mother! of old I had never
One wish denied me, nor trouble to fret;
 Now - must I cry out all vainly forever, -
Mother, sweet mother,
O sing, "Little brother,
 Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!"

 Mother, O mother! must longing and sorrow
Leave me in darkness, with eyes ever wet,
 And never the hope of a meeting to-morrow?
Answer me, mother,
And sing, "Little brother,
 Sleep, for thy mother bends over thee yet!"
