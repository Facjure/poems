When winter's cold and summer's heat
 Shall come and go again,
A hundred years will be complete
 Since Marion crossed the main,
And brought unto this wild retreat
 His dark-eyed wife of Spain.

He was the founder of a free
 And independent band,
Who lit the fires of liberty
 The revolution fanned:--
His patent of nobility
 Read in the ransomed land!

Around his deeds a lustre throngs,
 A heritage designed
To teach the world to spurn the wrongs
 Once threatened all mankind:--
To his posterity belongs
 The peerage of the mind.
