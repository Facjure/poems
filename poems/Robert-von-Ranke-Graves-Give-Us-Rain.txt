title: Give Us Rain.

 "Give us Rain, Rain," said the bean and the pea,
 "Not so much Sun,
 Not so much Sun."
 But the Sun smiles bravely and encouragingly,
 And no rain falls and no waters run.

 "Give us Peace, Peace," said the peoples oppressed,
 "Not so many Flags,
 Not so many Flags."
 But the Flags fly and the Drums beat, denying rest,
 And the children starve, they shiver in rags.
