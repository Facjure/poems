One road leads to London, 
One road leads to Wales, 
My road leads me seawards 
To the white dipping sails. 

One road leads to the river, 
And it goes singing slow; 
My road leads to shipping, 
Where the bronzed sailors go. 

Leads me, lures me, calls me 
To salt green tossing sea; 
A road without earth's road-dust 
Is the right road for me. 

A wet road heaving, shining, 
And wild with seagull's cries, 
A mad salt sea-wind blowing 
The salt spray in my eyes. 

My road calls me, lures me 
West, east, south, and north; 
Most roads lead men homewards, 
My road leads me forth. 

To add more miles to the tally 
Of grey miles left behind, 
In quest of that one beauty 
God put me here to find.
