Words are great forces in the realm of life:
 Be careful of their use.Who talks of hate,
Of poverty, of sickness, but sets rife
 These very elements to mar his fate.

When love, health, happiness, and plenty hear
 Their names repeated over day by day,
They wing their way like answering fairies near,
 Then nestle down within our homes to stay.

Who talks of evil conjures into shape
 The formless thing and gives it life and scope.
This is the law:then let no word escape
 That does not breathe of everlasting hope.
