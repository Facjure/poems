title: May And The Poets
---

There is May in books forever;
May will part from Spenser never;
May�s in Milton, May�s in Prior,
May�s in Chaucer, Thomson, Dyer;
May�s in all the Italian books:�
She has old and modern nooks,
Where she sleeps with nymphs and elves,
In happy places they call shelves,
And will rise and dress your rooms
With a drapery thick with blooms.
Come, ye rains, then if ye will,
May�s at home, and with me still;
But come rather, thou, good weather,
And find us in the fields together.
