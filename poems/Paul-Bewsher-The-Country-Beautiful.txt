I love the little daisies on the lawn
Which contemplate with wide and placid eyes
The blue and white enamel of the skies - 
The larks which sing their mattin-song at dawn,
High o'er the earth, and see the new Day born,
All stained with amethyst and amber dyes.
I love the shadowy woodland's hidden prize
Of fragrant violets, which the dewy morn

Doth open gently underneath the trees
To cast elusive perfume on each hour - 
The waving clover, full of drowsy bees,
That take their murmurous way from flower to flower.
Who could but think - deep in some sun-flecked glade - 
How God must love these things that He has made?

 Eastchurch, 1916.
