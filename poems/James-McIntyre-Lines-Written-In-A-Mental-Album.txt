title: Lines Written In A Mental Album.
---

Where each one expressed some sentiment.


In this album you may trace,
If not the lineaments of face,
There at least you will find
Photographs of the mind.

Some in earnest some in fun,
Some do lecture some do pun,
Here the maiden and the youth,
Each proclaim some precious truth.

And there is here some fine pages,
Written by maturer ages,
Where they show that time is brief,
That soon comes sere and yellow leaf.
