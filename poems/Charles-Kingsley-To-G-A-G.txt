A hasty jest I once let fall - 
 As jests are wont to be, untrue - 
 As if the sum of joy to you
Were hunt and picnic, rout and ball.

Your eyes met mine:I did not blame;
 You saw it:but I touched too near
 Some noble nerve; a silent tear
Spoke soft reproach, and lofty shame.

I do not wish those words unsaid.
 Unspoilt by praise and pleasure, you
 In that one look to woman grew,
While with a child, I thought, I played.

Next to mine own beloved so long!
 I have not spent my heart in vain.
 I watched the blade; I see the grain;
A woman's soul, most soft, yet strong.

Eversley, 1856.
