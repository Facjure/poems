Australia, advancing with rapid winged stride,
Shall plant among nations her banners in pride,
The yoke of dependence aside she will cast,
And build on the ruins and wrecks of the Past.
Her flag on the tempest will wave to proclaim
�Mong kingdoms and empires her national name;
The Future shall see it, asleep or unfurl�d,
The shelter of Freedom and boast of the world.

Australia, advancing like day on the sky,
Has glimmer�d thro� darkness, will blazon on high,
A Gem in its glitter has yet to be seen,
When Progress has placed her where England has been;
When bursting those limits above she will soar,
Outstretching all rivals who�ve mounted before,
And, resting, will blaze with her glories unfurl�d,
The empire of empires and boast of the world.

Australia, advancing with Power, will entwine
With Honour and Justice a Mercy divine;
No Despot shall trample no slave shall be bound
Oppression must totter and fall to the ground.
The stain of all ages, tyrannical sway,
Will pass like a flash or a shadow away,
And shrink to nothing �neath thunderbolts hurl�d
From the hand of the terror the boast of the world.

Australia, advancing with rapid wing�d stride,
Shall plant among nations her banners in pride;
The yoke of dependence aside she will cast,
And build on the ruins and wrecks of the Past.
Her flag in the tempest will wave to proclaim,
�Mong kingdoms and empires her national name,
And Ages shall see it, asleep or unfurl�d
The shelter of Freedom and boast of the world.
