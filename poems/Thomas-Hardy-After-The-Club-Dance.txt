Black'on frowns east on Maidon,
 And westward to the sea,
But on neither is his frown laden
 With scorn, as his frown on me!

At dawn my heart grew heavy,
 I could not sip the wine,
I left the jocund bevy
 And that young man o' mine.

The roadside elms pass by me, -
 Why do I sink with shame
When the birds a-perch there eye me?
 They, too, have done the same!
