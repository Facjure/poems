title: Psalm CXIV [1]
---

When Israel by Jehovah call'd
 From Egypt's hostile plain,
Pour'd forth in numbers as the Sand
 And sought the adjacent main:
Then God descended from on high
 To lead the favour'd Race
To rule o'er Jacob, &amp; his Name
 In Judah's Tribe to place.
The Sea at their approach alarm'd
 In wild amazement fled
And Jordan's flood was driven back
 Within it's fountainhead.
The Mountains from their basis shook
 Confess'd the Parent God!
With sudden throws like Rams they skipp'd
 And broken, fell abroad.
The little Hills by the same power
 Were from their Center torn
Like Lambs resistless they gave way
 In Tumult wild, upborn.
Ye Waves what strange amazement, say,
 Seiz'd on you that you fled?
Thou Jordan too! On Israel's march,
 Why driven to thy Head?
Ye Mountains whence this sudden fright
 That shook you from your base?
And whence, ye little Hills, your flight

 From Israel's chosen Race?
Tremble thou Earth! Jehovah leads,
 And guards the might Host!
That God, who by his awful Word,
 Commands the Stream to flow[2]
From flinty Rocks; &amp; pouring thence,
 To form the Lake below.
