Hills of the west, that gird
 Forest and farm,
Home of the nestling bird,
 Housing from harm,
When on your tops is heard
 Storm:

Hills of the west, that bar
 Belts of the gloam,
Under the twilight star,
 Where the mists roam,
Take ye the wanderer
 Home.

Hills of the west, that dream
 Under the moon,
Making of wind and stream,
 Late-heard and soon,
Parts of your lives that seem
 Tune.

Hills of the west, that take
 Slumber to ye,
Be it for sorrow's sake
 Or memory,
Part of such slumber make
 Me.
