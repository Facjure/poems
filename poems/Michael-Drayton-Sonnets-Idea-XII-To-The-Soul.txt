title: Sonnets: Idea XII To The Soul
---

That learned Father which so firmly proves
The soul of man immortal and divine,
And doth the several offices define
Anima.Gives her that name, as she the body moves.
Amor.Then is she love, embracing charity.
Animus.Moving a will in us, it is the mind;
Mens.Retaining knowledge, still the same in kind.
Memoria.As intellectual, it is memory.
Ratio.In judging, reason only is her name.
Sensus.In speedy apprehension, it is sense.
Conscientia.In right and wrong they call her conscience;
Spiritus.The spirit, when it to God-ward doth inflame:
These of the soul the several functions be,
Which my heart lightened by thy love doth see.
