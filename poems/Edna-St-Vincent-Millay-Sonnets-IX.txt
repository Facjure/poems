 Let you not say of me when I am old,
 In pretty worship of my withered hands
 Forgetting who I am, and how the sands
 Of such a life as mine run red and gold
 Even to the ultimate sifting dust, "Behold,
 Here walketh passionless age!"--for there expands
 A curious superstition in these lands,
 And by its leave some weightless tales are told.

 In me no lenten wicks watch out the night;
 I am the booth where Folly holds her fair;
 Impious no less in ruin than in strength,
 When I lie crumbled to the earth at length,
 Let you not say, "Upon this reverend site
 The righteous groaned and beat their breasts in prayer."
