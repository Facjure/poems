How some succeed who have least need,
In that they make no effort for!
And pluck, where others pluck a weed,
The burning blossom of a star,
Grown from no earthly seed.

For some shall reap that never sow;
And some shall toil and not attain, - 
What boots it in ourselves to know
Such labor here is not in vain,
When we still see it so!
