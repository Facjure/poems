 They's nothin' in the name to strike
 A feller more'n common like!
 'Taint liable to git no praise
 Ner nothin' like it nowadays;
 An' yit that name o' her'n is jest
 As purty as the purtiest -
 And more 'n that, I'm here to say
 I'll live a-thinkin' thataway
 And die far Marthy Ellen!

 It may be I was prejudust
 In favor of it from the fust -
 'Cause I kin ricollect jest how
 We met, and hear her mother now
 A-callin' of her down the road -
 And, aggervatin' little toad! -
 I see her now, jes' sort o' half-
 Way disapp'inted, turn and laugh
 And mock her - "Marthy Ellen!"

 Our people never had no fuss,
 And yit they never tuck to us;
 We neighbered back and foreds some;
 Until they see she liked to come
 To our house - and me and her
 Were jest together ever'whur
 And all the time - and when they'd see
 That I liked her and she liked me,
 They'd holler "Marthy Ellen!"

 When we growed up, and they shet down
 On me and her a-runnin' roun'
 Together, and her father said
 He'd never leave her nary red,
 So he'p him, ef she married me,
 And so on - and her mother she
 Jest agged the gyrl, and said she 'lowed
 She'd ruther see her in her shroud,
 I writ to Marthy Ellen -

 That is, I kindo' tuck my pen
 In hand, and stated whur and when
 The undersigned would be that night,
 With two good hosses saddled right
 Far lively travelin' in case
 Her folks 'ud like to jine the race.
 She sent the same note back, and writ
 "The rose is red!" right under it -
 "Your 'n allus, Marthy Ellen."

 That's all, I reckon - Nothin' more
 To tell but what you've heerd afore -
 The same old story, sweeter though
 Far all the trouble, don't you know.
 Old-fashioned name! and yit it's jest
 As purty as the purtiest;
 And more 'n that, I'm here to say
 I'll live a-thinking thataway,
 And die far Marthy Ellen!
