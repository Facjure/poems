 Sir, we approve your curling lip and nose
At this vile sight.
 These men, these women are brute beasts? - Who knows,
Sir, but that you are right?

 Panders and harlots, rogues and thieves and worse,
We are a crew
 Whose pitiful plunder's honoured in the purse
Of gentlemen like you.

 Whom holy Competition's taught (like us)
"What's thine is mine!" - 
 How we must love you who have made us thus,
You may perhaps divine!
