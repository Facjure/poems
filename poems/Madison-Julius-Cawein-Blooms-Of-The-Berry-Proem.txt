title: Blooms Of The Berry - Proem.

Wine-warm winds that sigh and sing,
 Led me, wrapped in many moods,
 Thro' the green sonorous woods
Of belated Spring;

Till I came where, glad with heat,
 Waste and wild the fields were strewn,
 Olden as the olden moon,
At my weary feet;

Wild and white with starry bloom,
 One far milky-way that dashed,
 When some mad wind o'er it flashed,
Into billowy foam.

I, bewildered, gazed around,
 As one on whose heavy dreams
 Comes a sudden burst of beams,
Like a mighty sound.

If the grander flowers I sought,
 But these berry-blooms to you,
 Evanescent as their dew,
Only these I brought.

 JULY 3, 1887.
