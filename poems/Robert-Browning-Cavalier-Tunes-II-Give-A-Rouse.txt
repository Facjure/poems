title: Cavalier Tunes - II - Give A Rouse
---

I.
King Charles, and who�ll do him right now?
King Charles, and who�s ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse: here�s, in hell�s despite now,
King Charles!

II.
Who gave me the goods that went since?
Who raised me the house that sank once?
Who helped me to gold I spent since?
Who found me in wine you drank once?

(Chorus.) King Charles, and who�ll do him right now?
King Charles, and who�s ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse: here�s, in hell�s despite now,
King Charles!

III.
To whom used my boy George quaff else,
By the old fool�s side that begot him?
For whom did he cheer and laugh else,
While Noll�s damned troopers shot him?

(Chorus.) King Charles, and who�ll do him right now?
King Charles, and who�s ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse: here�s, in hell�s despite now,
King Charles!
