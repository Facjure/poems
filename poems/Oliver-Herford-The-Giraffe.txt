SEE the Gi-raffe; he is so tall
There is not room to get him all
U-pon the page. His head is high-er - 
The pic-ture proves it - than the Spire.
That's why the na-tives, when they race
To catch him, call it stee-ple-chase.
His chief de-light it is to set
A good example: shine or wet
He rises ere the break of day,
And starts his break-fast right away.
His food has such a way to go, - 
His throat's so very long, - and so
An early break-fast he must munch
To get it down ere time for lunch.
