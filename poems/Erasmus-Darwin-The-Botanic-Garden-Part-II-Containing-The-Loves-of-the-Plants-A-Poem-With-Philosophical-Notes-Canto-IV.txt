 The Botanic Garden. Part II. Containing The Loves of the Plants. A Poem. With Philosophical Notes: Canto IV.

 Now the broad Sun his golden orb unshrouds,
 Flames in the west, and paints the parted clouds;
 O'er heaven's wide arch refracted lustres flow,
 And bend in air the many-colour'd bow.--
 5 --The tuneful Goddess on the glowing sky
 Fix'd in mute extacy her glistening eye;
 And then her lute to sweeter tones she strung,
 And swell'd with softer chords the Paphian song.
 Long ailes of Oaks return'd the silver sound,
 10And amorous Echoes talk'd along the ground;
 Pleas'd Lichfield listen'd from her sacred bowers,
 Bow'd her tall groves, and shook her stately towers.

 "Nymph! not for thee the radiant day returns,
 Nymph! not for thee the golden solstice burns,
 15Refulgent CEREA!--at the dusky hour
 She seeks with pensive step the mountain-bower,


 [Pleas'd Lichfield. I. 11. The scenery described at the beginning of the first part, or economy of vegetation, is taken from a botanic garden about a mile from Lichfield.

 Cerea. l. 15. Cactus grandiflorus, or Cereus. Twenty males, one female. This flower is a native of Jamaica and Veracrux. It expands a most exquisitely beautiful corol, and emits a most fragrant odour for a few hours in the night, and then closes to open no more. The flower is nearly a foot in diameter; the inside of the calyx of a splendid yellow, and the numerous petals of a pure white: it begins to open about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, and closes before sun-rise in the morning. Martyn's Letters, p. 294. The Cistus labdiniferus, and many other flowers, lose their petals after having been a few hours expanded in the day-time; for in these plants the stigma is soon impregnated by the numerous anthers: in many flowers of the Cistus lubdiniferus I observed two or three of the stamens were perpetually bent into contact with the pistil.

 The Nyctanthes, called Arabian Jasmine, is another flower, which expands a beautiful corol, and gives out a most delicate perfume during the night, and not in the day, in its native country, whence its name; botanical philosophers have not yet explained this wonderful property; perhaps the plant sleeps during the day as some animals do; and its odoriferous glands only emit their fragrance during the expansion of the petals; that is, during its waking hours: the Geranium triste has the same property of giving up its fragrance only in the night. The flowers of the Cucurbita lagenaria are said to close when the sun shines upon them. In our climate many flowers, as tragopogon, and hibiscus, close their flowers before the hottest part of the day comes on; and the flowers of some species of cucubalus, and Silene, viscous campion, are closed all day; but when the sun leaves them they expand, and emit a very agreeable scent; whence such plants are termed noctiflora.]


 Bright as the blush of rising morn, and warms
 The dull cold eye of Midnight with her charms.
 There to the skies she lifts her pencill'd brows,
 20Opes her fair lips, and breathes her virgin vows;
 Eyes the white zenyth; counts the suns, that roll
 Their distant fires, and blaze around the Pole;
 Or marks where Jove directs his glittering car
 O'er Heaven's blue vault,--Herself a brighter star.
 25 --There as soft Zephyrs sweep with pausing airs
 Thy snowy neck, and part thy shadowy hairs,
 Sweet Maid of Night! to Cynthia's sober beams
 Glows thy warm cheek, thy polish'd bosom gleams.
 In crowds around thee gaze the admiring swains,
 30And guard in silence the enchanted plains;
 Drop the still tear, or breathe the impassion'd sigh,
 And drink inebriate rapture from thine eye.
 Thus, when old Needwood's hoary scenes the Night
 Paints with blue shadow, and with milky light;
 35Where MUNDY pour'd, the listening nymphs among,
 Loud to the echoing vales his parting song;
 With measured step the Fairy Sovereign treads,
 Shakes her high plume, and glitters o'er the meads;
 Round each green holly leads her sportive train,
 40And little footsteps mark the circled plain;
 Each haunted rill with silver voices rings,
 And Night's sweet bird in livelier accents sings.

 Ere the bright star, which leads the morning sky,
 Hangs o'er the blushing east his diamond eye,
 45The chaste TROPAEO leaves her secret bed;
 A saint-like glory trembles round her head;


 [ Where Mundy. l. 35. Alluding to an unpublished poem by F. N. Mundy, Esq. on his leaving Needwood-Forest.

 Trop�olum. l. 45. Majus. Garden Nasturtion, or greater Indian cress. Eight males, one female. Miss E. C. Linneus first observed the Trop�olum Majus to emit sparks or flashes in the mornings before sun-rise, during the months of June or July, and also during the twilight in the evening, but not after total darkness came on; these singular scintillations were shewn to her father and other philosophers; and Mr. Wilcke, a celebrated electrician, believed them to be electric. Lin. Spec. Plantar. p. 490. Swedish Acts for the year 1762. Pulteney's View of Linneus, p. 220. Nor is this more wonderful than that the electric eel and torpedo should give voluntary shocks of electricity; and in this plant perhaps, as in those animals, it may be a mode of defence, by which it harrasses or destroys the night-flying insects which infest it; and probably it may emit the same sparks during the day, which must be then invisible. This curious subject deserves further investigation. See Dictamnus. The ceasing to shine of this plant after twilight might induce one to conceive, that it absorbed and emitted light, like the Bolognian Phosphorus, or calcined oyster-shells, so well explained by Mr. B. Wilson, and by T. B. Beccari. Exper. on Phosphori, by B. Wilson. Dodsley. The light of the evening, at the same distance from noon, is much greater, as I have repeatedly observed, than the light of the morning: this is owing, I suppose, to the phosphorescent quality of almost all bodies, in a greater or less degree, which thus absorb light during the sun-shine, and continue to emit it again for some time afterwards, though not in such quantity as to produce apparent scintillations. The nectary of this plant grows from what is supposed to be the calyx; but this supposed calyx is coloured; and perhaps, from this circumstance of its bearing the nectary, should rather be esteemed a part of the coral. See an additional note at the end of the poem.]


 Eight watchful swains along the lawns of night
 With amorous steps pursue the virgin light;
 O'er her fair form the electric lustre plays,
 50And cold she moves amid the lambent blaze.
 So shines the glow-fly, when the sun retires,
 And gems the night-air with phosphoric fires;


 [So shines the glow-fly. l. 52. In Jamaica, in some seasons of the year, the fire-flies are seen in the evenings in great abundance. When they settle on the ground, the bull-frog greedily devours them; which seems to have given origin to a curious, though cruel, method of destroying these animals: if red-hot pieces of charcoal be thrown towards them in the dusk of the evening, they leap at them, and, hastily swallowing them, are burnt to death.]


 Thus o'er the marsh a�rial lights betray,
 And charm the unwary wanderer from his way.
 55So when thy King, Assyria, fierce and proud,
 Three human victims to his idol vow'd;
 Rear'd a vast pyre before the golden shrine
 Of sulphurous coal, and pitch-exsuding pine;--
 --Loud roar the flames, the iron nostrils breathe,
 60And the huge bellows pant and heave beneath;
 Bright and more bright the blazing deluge flows,
 And white with seven-fold heat the furnace glows.
 And now the Monarch fix'd with dread surprize
 Deep in the burning vault his dazzled eyes.
 65"Lo! Three unbound amid the frightful glare,
 Unscorch'd their sandals, and unsing'd their hair!
 And now a fourth with seraph-beauty bright
 Descends, accosts them, and outshines the light!
 Fierce flames innocuous, as they step, retire!
 70And slow they move amid a world of fire!"
 He spoke,--to Heaven his arms repentant spread,
 And kneeling bow'd his gem-incircled head.
 Two Sister-Nymphs, the fair AVENAS, lead
 Their fleecy squadrons on the lawns of Tweed;
 75Pass with light step his wave-worn banks along,
 And wake his Echoes with their silver tongue;
 Or touch the reed, as gentle Love inspires,
 In notes accordant to their chaste desires.

"Sweet ECHO! sleeps thy vocal shell,
"Where this high arch o'erhangs the dell;
"While Tweed with sun-reflecting streams
"Chequers thy rocks with dancing beams?--


 [Ovena. l. 73. Oat. The numerous families of grasses have all three males, and two females, except Anthoxanthum, which gives the grateful smell to hay, and has but two males. The herbs of this order of vegetables support the countless tribes of graminivorous animals. The seeds of the smaller kinds of grasses, as of aira, poa, briza, stipa, &amp;c. are the sustenance of many sorts of birds. The seeds of the large grasses, as of wheat, barley, rye, oats, supply food to the human species.

 It seems to have required more ingenuity to think of feeding nations of mankind with so small a seed, than with the potatoe of Mexico, or the bread-fruit of the southern islands; hence Ceres in Egypt, which was the birth-place of our European arts, was deservedly celebrated amongst their divinities, as well as Osyris, who invented the Plough.

 Mr. Wahlborn observes, that as wheat, rye, and many of the grasses, and plantain, lift up their anthers on long filments, and thus expose the enclosed fecundating dust to be washed away by the rains, a scarcity of corn is produced by wet summers; hence the necessity of a careful choice of seed wheat, as that, which had not received the dust of the anthers, will not grow, though it may appear well to the eye. The straw of the oat seems to have been the first musical instrument, invented during the pastoral ages of the world, before the discovery of metals. See note on Cistus.]

 "Here may no clamours harsh intrude,
 No brawling hound or clarion rude;
 85Here no fell beast of midnight prowl,
 And teach thy tortured cliffs to howl!

 III.

 "Be thine to pour these vales along
 Some artless Shepherd's evening song;
 While Night's sweet bird, from yon high spray
 90Responsive, listens to his lay.

 IV.

 "And if, like me, some love-lorn maid
 "Should sing her sorrows to thy shade,
 "Oh, sooth her breast, ye rocks around!
 "With softest sympathy of sound."

 95From ozier bowers the brooding Halcyons peep,
 The Swans pursuing cleave the glassy deep,
 On hovering wings the wondering Reed-larks play,
 And silent Bitterns listen to the lay.--
 Three shepherd-swains beneath the beechen shades
 100 Twine rival garlands for the tuneful maids;
 On each smooth bark the mystic love-knot frame,
 Or on white sands inscribe the favour'd name.

 From Time's remotest dawn where China brings
 In proud succession all her Patriot-Kings;
 105 O'er desert-sands, deep gulfs, and hills sublime,
 Extends her massy wall from clime to clime;
 With bells and dragons crests her Pagod-bowers,
 Her silken palaces, and porcelain towers;
 With long canals a thousand nations laves;
 110 Plants all her wilds, and peoples all her waves;
 Slow treads fair CANNABIS the breezy strand,
 The distaff streams dishevell'd in her hand;


 [Cannabis. l. 111. Chinese Hemp. Two houses. Five males. A new species of hemp, of which an account is given by K. Fitzgerald, Esq. in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, and which is believed to be much superior to the hemp of other countries. A few seeds of this plant were sown in England on the 4th of June, and grew to fourteen feet seven inches in height by the middle of October; they were nearly seven inches in circumference, and bore many lateral branches, and produced very white and tough fibres. At some parts of the time these plants grew nearly eleven inches in a week. Philos. Trans. Vol. LXXII. p. 46.]


 Now to the left her ivory neck inclines,
 And leads in Paphian curves its azure lines;
 115 Dark waves the fringed lid, the warm cheek glows,
 And the fair ear the parting locks disclose;
 Now to the right with airy sweep she bends,
 Quick join the threads, the dancing spole depends.
 --Five Swains attracted guard the Nymph, by turns
 120 Her grace inchants them, and her beauty burns;
 To each She bows with sweet assuasive smile,
 Hears his soft vows, and turns her spole the while.

 So when with light and shade, concordant strife!
 Stern CLOTHO weaves the chequer'd thread of life;
 125 Hour after hour the growing line extends,
 The cradle and the coffin bound its ends;


 [Paphian curves. l. 114. In his ingenious work, entitled, The Analysis of Beauty, Mr. Hogarth believes that the triangular glass, which was dedicated to Venus in her temple at Paphos, contained in it a line bending spirally round a cone with a certain degree of curviture; and that this pyramidal outline and serpentine curve constitute the principles of Grace and Beauty.]


 Soft cords of silk the whirling spoles reveal,
 If smiling Fortune turn the giddy wheel;
 But if sweet Love with baby-fingers twines,
 130 And wets with dewy lips the lengthening lines,
 Skein after skein celestial tints unfold,
 And all the silken tissue shines with gold.

 Warm with sweet blushes bright GALANTHA glows,
 And prints with frolic step the melting snows;


 [Galanthus. l. 133. Nivalis. Snowdrop. Six males, one female. The first flower that appears after the winter solstice. See Stillingfleet's Calendar of Flora.

 Some snowdrop-roots taken up in winter, and boiled, had the insipid mucilaginous taste of the Orchis, and, if cured in the same manner, would probably make as good salep. The roots of the Hyacinth, I am informed, are equally insipid, and might be used as an article of food. Gmelin, in his History of Siberia, says the Martigon Lily makes a part of the food of that country, which is of the same natural order as the snowdrop. Some roots of Crocus, which I boiled, had a disagreeable flavour.

 The difficulty of raising the Orchis from seed has, perhaps, been a principal reason of its not being cultivated in this country as an article of food. It is affirmed, by one of the Linnean school, in the Amoenit. Academ. that the seeds of Orchis will ripen, if you destroy the new bulb; and that Lily of the Valley, Convallaria, will produce many more seeds, and ripen them, if the roots be crowded in a garden-pot, so as to prevent them from producing many bulbs. Vol. VI. p. 120. It is probable either of these methods may succeed with these and other bulbous-rooted plants, as snowdrops, and might render their cultivation profitable in this climate. The root of the asphodelus ramosus, branchy asphodel, is used to feed swine in France; and starch is obtained from the alstromeria licta. Memoires d'Agricult.]


 135 O'er silent floods, white hills, and glittering meads
 Six rival swains the playful beauty leads,
 Chides with her dulcet voice the tardy Spring,
 Bids slumbering Zephyr stretch his folded wing,
 Wakes the hoarse Cuckoo in his gloomy cave,
 140 And calls the wondering Dormouse from his grave,
 Bids the mute Redbreast cheer the budding grove,
 And plaintive Ringdove tune her notes to love.

 Spring! with thy own sweet smile, and tuneful tongue,
 Delighted BELLIS calls her infant throng.
 145 Each on his reed astride, the Cherub-train
 Watch her kind looks, and circle o'er the plain;
 Now with young wonder touch the siding snail,
 Admire his eye-tipp'd horns, and painted mail;
 Chase with quick step, and eager arms outspread,
 150 The pausing Butterfly from mead to mead;


 [Bellis prolifera l. 144. Hen and chicken Daisy; in this beautiful monster not only the impletion or doubling of the petals takes place, as described in the note on Alcea; but a numerous circlet of less flowers on peduncles, or footstalks, rise from the sides of the calyx, and surround the proliferous parent. The same occurs in Calendula, marigold; in Heracium, hawk-weed; and in Scabiosa, Scabious. Phil. Botan. p. 82.]


 Or twine green oziers with the fragrant gale,
 The azure harebel, and the primrose pale,
 Join hand in hand, and in procession gay
 Adorn with votive wreaths the shrine of May.
 155 --So moves the Goddess to the Idalian groves,
 And leads her gold-hair'd family of Loves.
 These, from the flaming furnace, strong and bold
 Pour the red steel into the sandy mould;
 On tinkling anvils (with Vulcanian art),
 160 Turn with hot tongs, and forge the dreadful dart;
 The barbed head on whirling jaspers grind,
 And dip the point in poison for the mind;
 Each polish'd shaft with snow-white plumage wing,
 Or strain the bow reluctant to its string.
 165 Those on light pinion twine with busy hands,
 Or stretch from bough to bough the flowery bands;


 [The fragrant Gale. l. 151. The buds of the Myrica Gale possess an agreeable aromatic fragrance, and might be worth attending to as an article of the Materia Medica. Mr. Sparman suspects, that the green wax-like substance, with which at certain times of the year the berries of the Myrica cerifera, or candle-berry Myrtle, are covered, are deposited there by insects. It is used by the inhabitants for making candles, which he says burn rather better than those made of tallow. Voyage to the Cape, V. I. 345.]


 Scare the dark beetle, as he wheels on high,
 Or catch in silken nets the gilded fly;
 Call the young Zephyrs to their fragrant bowers,
 170 And stay with kisses sweet the Vernal Hours.
 Where, as proud Maffon rises rude and bleak,
 And with mishapen turrets crests the Peak,
 Old Matlock gapes with marble jaws, beneath,
 And o'er fear'd Derwent bends his flinty teeth;
 175 Deep in wide caves below the dangerous soil
 Blue sulphurs flame, imprison'd waters boil.


 [Deep in wide caves. l. 175. The arguments which tend to shew that the warm springs of this country are produced from steam raised by deep subterraneous fires, and afterwards condensed between the strata of the mountains, appear to me much more conclusive, than the idea of their being warmed by chemical combinations near the surface of the earth: for, 1st, their heat has kept accurately the same perhaps for many centuries, certainly as long as we have been possessed of good thermometers; which cannot be well explained, without supposing that they are first in a boiling state. For as the heat of boiling water is 212, and that of the internal parts of the earth 48, it is easy to understand, that the steam raised from boiling water, after being condensed in some mountain, and passing from thence through a certain space of the cold earth, must be cooled always to a given degree; and it is probable the distance from the exit of the spring, to the place where the steam is condensed, might be guessed by the degree of its warmth.

 2. In the dry summer of 1780, when all other springs were either dry or much diminished, those of Buxton and Matlock (as I was well informed on the spot), had suffered no diminution; which proves that the sources of these warm springs are at great depths below the surface of the earth.

 3. There are numerous perpendicular fissures in the rocks of Derbyshire, in which the ores of lead and copper are found, and which pass to unknown depths; and might thence afford a passage to steam from great subterraneous fires.

 4. If these waters were heated by the decomposition of pyrites, there would be some chalybeate taste or sulphureous smell in them. See note in part 1. on the existence of central fires.]


 Impetuous steams in spiral colums rise
 Through rifted rocks, impatient for the skies;
 Or o'er bright seas of bubbling lavas blow,
 180 As heave and toss the billowy fires below;
 Condensed on high, in wandering rills they glide
 From Maffon's dome, and burst his sparry side;
 Round his grey towers, and down his fringed walls,
 From cliff to cliff, the liquid treasure falls;
 185 In beds of stalactite, bright ores among,
 O'er corals, shells, and crystals, winds along;
 Crusts the green mosses, and the tangled wood,
 And sparkling plunges to its parent flood.
 --O'er the warm wave a smiling youth presides,
 190 Attunes its murmurs, its meanders guides,

 (The blooming FUCUS), in her sparry coves
 To amorous Echo sings his secret loves,
 Bathes his fair forehead in the misty stream,
 And with sweet breath perfumes the rising steam.
 195 --So, erst, an Angel o'er Bethesda's springs,
 Each morn descending, shook his dewy wings;
 And as his bright translucent form He laves,
 Salubrious powers enrich the troubled waves.


 [Fucus.l. 191. Clandestine marriage. A species of Fucus, or of Conserva, soon appears in all basons which contain water. Dr. Priestley found that great quantities of pure dephlogisticated air were given up in water at the points of this vegetable, particularly in the sunshine, and that hence it contributed to preserve the water in reservoirs from becoming putrid. The minute divisions of the leaves of subaquatic plants, as mentioned in the note on Trapa, and of the gills of fish, seem to serve another purpose besides that of increasing their surface, which has not, I believe, been attended to, and that is to facilitate the separation of the air, which is mechanically mixed or chemically dissolved in water by their points or edges; this appears on immersing a dry hairy leaf in water fresh from a pump; innumerable globules like quicksilver appear on almost every point; for the extremities of these points attract the particles of water less forcibly than those particles attract each other; hence the contained air, whose elasticity was but just balanced by the attractive power of the surrounding particles of water to each other, finds at the point of each fibre a place where the resistance to its expansion is less; and in consequence it there expands, and becomes a bubble of air. It is easy to foresee that the rays of the sunshine, by being refracted and in part relieved by the two surfaces of these minute air-bubbles, must impart to them much more heat than to the transparent water; and thus facilitate their ascent by further expanding them; that the points of vegetables attract the particles of water less than they attract each other, is seen by the spherical form of dew-drops on the points of grass. See note on Vegetable Respiration in Part I.]


 Amphibious Nymph, from Nile's prolific bed
 200 Emerging TRAPA lifts her pearly head;
 Fair glows her virgin cheek and modest breast,
 A panoply of scales deforms the rest;


 [Trapa, l. 200. Four males, one female. The lower leaves of this plant grow under water, and are divided into minute capillary ramifications; while the upper leaves are broad and round, and have air-bladders in their footstalks to support them above the surface of the water. As the aerial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs, by exposing a large surface of vessels with their contained fluids to the influence of the air; so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose like the gills of fish; and perhaps gain from water or give to it a similar material. As the material thus necessary to life seems to abound more in air than in water, the subaquatic leaves of this plant, and of sisymbrium, coenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crowfoot, and some others, are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface; whilst those above water are undivided. So the plants on high mountains have their upper leaves more divided, as pimpinella, petroselinum, and others, because here the air is thinner, and thence a larger surface of contact is required. The stream of water also passes but once along the gills of fish, as it is sooner deprived of its virtue; whereas the air is both received and ejected by the action of the lungs of land-animals. The whale seems to be an exception to the above, as he receives water and spouts it out again from an organ, which I suppose to be a respiratory one. As spring-water is nearly of the same degree of heat in all climates, the aquatic plants, which grow in rills or fountains, are found equally in the torrid, temperate, and frigid zones, as water-cress, water-parsnip, ranunculus, and many others.

 In warmer climates the watery grounds are usefully cultivated, as with rice; and the roots of some aquatic plants are said to have supplied food, as the ancient Lotus in Egypt, which some have supposed to be the Nymph�a.--In Siberia the roots of the Butemus, or flowering rush, are eaten, which is well worth further enquiry, as they grow spontaneously in our ditches and rivers, which at present produce no esculent vegetables; and might thence become an article of useful cultivation. Herodotus affirms, that the Egyptian Lotus grows in the Nile, and resembles a Lily. That the natives dry it in the sun, and take the pulp out of it, which grows like the head of a poppy, and bake it for bread. Enterpe. Many grit-stones and coals, which I have seen, seem to bear an impression of the roots of the Nymph�a, which are often three or four inches thick, especially the white-flowered one.]


 Her quivering fins and panting gills she hides
 But spreads her silver arms upon the tides;
 205 Slow as she sails, her ivory neck she laves,
 And shakes her golden tresses o'er the waves.
 Charm'd round the Nymph, in circling gambols glide
 Four Nereid-forms, or shoot along the tide;
 Now all as one they rise with frolic spring,
 210 And beat the wondering air on humid wing;
 Now all descending plunge beneath the main,
 And lash the foam with undulating train;
 Above, below, they wheel, retreat, advance,
 In air and ocean weave the mazy dance;
 215 Bow their quick heads, and point their diamond eyes,
 And twinkle to the sun with ever-changing dyes.

 Where Andes, crested with volcanic beams,
 Sheds a long line of light on Plata's streams;
 Opes all his springs, unlocks his golden caves,
 220 And feeds and freights the immeasurable waves;
 Delighted OCYMA at twilight hours
 Calls her light car, and leaves the sultry bowers;--
 Love's rising ray, and Youth's seductive dye,
 Bloom'd on her cheek, and brighten'd in her eye;
 225 Chaste, pure, and white, a zone of silver graced
 Her tender breast, as white, as pure, as chaste;---


 [Ocymum salinun. l. 221. Saline Basil. Class Two Powers. The Abb� Molina, in his History of Chili, translated from the Italian by the Abb� Grewvel, mentions a species of Basil, which he calls Ocymum salinum: he says it resembles the common basil, except that the stalk is round and jointed; and that though it grows 60 miles from the sea, yet every morning it is covered with saline globules, which are hard and splendid, appearing at a distance like dew; and that each plant furnishes about half an ounce of fine salt every day, which the peasants collect, and use as common salt, but esteem it superior in flavour.

 As an article of diet, salt seems to act simply as a stimulus, not containing any nourishment, and is the only fossil substance which the caprice of mankind has yet taken into their stomachs along with their food; and, like all other unnatural stimuli, is not necessary to people in health, and contributes to weaken our system; though it may be useful as a medicine. It seems to be the immediate cause of the sea-scurvy, as those patients quickly recover by the use of fresh provisions; and is probably a remote cause of scrophula (which consists in the want of irritability in the absorbent vessels), and is therefore serviceable to these patients; as wine is necessary to those whose stomachs have been weakened by its use. The universality of the use of salt with our food, and in our cookery, has rendered it difficult to prove the truth of these observations. I suspect that flesh-meat cut into thin slices, either raw or boiled, might be preserved in coarse sugar or treacle; and thus a very nourishing and salutary diet might be presented to our seamen. See note on Salt-rocks, in Vol. I, Canto II. If a person unaccustomed to much salt should eat a couple of red-herrings, his insensible perspiration will be so much increased by the stimulus of the salt, that he will find it necessary in about two hours to drink a quart of water: the effects of a continued use of salt in weakening the action of the lymphatic system may hence be deduced.]


 By four fond swains in playful circles drawn,
 On glowing wheels she tracks the moon-bright lawn,
 Mounts the rude cliff, unveils her blushing charms,
 230 And calls the panting zephyrs to her arms.
 Emerged from ocean springs the vaporous air,
 Bathes her light limbs, uncurls her amber hair,
 Incrusts her beamy form with films saline,
 And Beauty blazes through the crystal shrine.--
 235 So with pellucid studs the ice-flower gems
 Her rimy foliage, and her candied stems.
 So from his glassy horns, and pearly eyes,
 The diamond-beetle darts a thousand dyes;
 Mounts with enamel'd wings the vesper gale,
 240 And wheeling shines in adamantine mail.

 Thus when loud thunders o'er Gomorrah burst,
 And heaving earthquakes shook his realms accurst,
 An Angel-guest led forth the trembling Fair
 With shadowy hand, and warn'd the guiltless pair;


 [Ice-flower. l. 235. Mesembryanthemum crystallinum.]


 245 "Haste from these lands of sin, ye Righteous! fly,
 Speed the quick step, nor turn the lingering eye!"--
 --Such the command, as fabling Bards indite,
 When Orpheus charm'd the grisly King of Night;
 Sooth'd the pale phantoms with his plaintive lay,
 250 And led the fair Assurgent into day.--
 Wide yawn'd the earth, the fiery tempest flash'd,
 And towns and towers in one vast ruin crash'd;--
 Onward they move,---loud horror roars behind,
 And shrieks of Anguish bellow in the wind.
 255 With many a sob, amid a thousand fears,
 The beauteous wanderer pours her gushing tears;
 Each soft connection rends her troubled breast,
 --She turns, unconscious of the stern behest!--
 "I faint!--I fall!--ah, me!--sensations chill
 260 Shoot through my bones, my shuddering bosom thrill!
 I freeze! I freeze! just Heaven regards my fault,
 Numbs my cold limbs, and hardens into salt!--
 Not yet, not yet, your dying Love resign!--
 This last, last kiss receive!--no longer thine!"--
 265 She said, and ceased,--her stiffen'd form He press'd,
 And strain'd the briny column to his breast;
 Printed with quivering lips the lifeless snow,
 And wept, and gazed the monument of woe.--
 So when Aeneas through the flames of Troy
 270 Bore his pale fire, and led his lovely boy;
 With loitering step the fair Creusa stay'd,
 And Death involved her in eternal shade.--
 Oft the lone Pilgrim that his road forsakes,
 Marks the wide ruins, and the sulphur'd lakes;
 275 On mouldering piles amid asphaltic mud
 Hears the hoarse bittern, where Gomorrah stood;
 Recalls the unhappy Pair with lifted eye,
 Leans on the crystal tomb, and breathes the silent sigh..

 With net-wove sash and glittering gorget dress'd,
 280 And scarlet robe lapell'd upon her breast,
 Stern ARA frowns, the measured march assumes,
 Trails her long lance, and nods her shadowy plumes;


 [Arum. I. 281. Cuckow-pint, of the class Gynandria, or masculine ladies. The pistil, or female part of the flower, rises like a club, is covered above or clothed, as it were, by the anthers or males; and some of the species have a large scarlet blotch in the middle of every leaf.

 The singular and wonderful structure of this flower has occasioned many disputes amongst botanists. See Tourniff. Malpig. Dillen. Rivin. &amp;c. The receptacle is enlarged into a naked club, with the germs at its base; the stamens are affixed to the receptacle amidst the germs (a natural prodigy), and thus do not need the assistance of elevating filaments: hence the flower may be said to be inverted. Families of Plants translated from Linneus, p. 618.

 The spadix of this plant is frequently quite white, or coloured, and the leaves liable to be streaked with white, and to have black or scarlet blotches on them. As the plant has no corol or blossom, it is probable the coloured juices in these parts of the sheath or leaves may serve the same purpose as the coloured juices in the petals of other flowers; from which I suppose the honey to be prepared. See note on Helleborus. I am informed that those tulip-roots which have a red cuticle produce red flowers. See Rubia.

 When the petals of the tulip become striped with many colours, the plant loses almost half of its height; and the method of making them thus break into colours is by transplanting them into a meagre or sandy soil, after they have previously enjoyed a richer soil: hence it appears, that the plant is weakened when the flower becomes variegated. See note on Anemone. For the acquired habits of vegetables, see Tulipa, Orchis.

 The roots of the Arum are scratched up and eaten by thrushes in severe snowy seasons. White's Hist. of Selbourn, p. 43.]


 While Love's soft beams illume her treacherous eyes,
 And Beauty lightens through the thin disguise.
 285 So erst, when HERCULES, untamed by toil,
 Own'd the soft power of DEJANIRA'S smile;--
 His lion-spoils the laughing Fair demands,
 And gives the distaff to his awkward hands;
 O'er her white neck the bristly mane she throws,
 290 And binds the gaping whiskers on her brows;
 Plaits round her slender waist the shaggy vest,
 And clasps the velvet paws across her breast.
 Next with soft hands the knotted club she rears,
 Heaves up from earth, and on her shoulder bears.
 295 Onward with loftier step the Beauty treads,
 And trails the brinded ermine o'er the meads;
 Wolves, bears, and bards, forsake the affrighted groves,
 And grinning Satyrs tremble, as she moves.

 CARYO'S sweet smile DIANTHUS proud admires,
 300 And gazing burns with unallow'd desires;


 [Dianthus. l. 299. Superbus. Proud Pink. There is a kind of pink called Fairchild's mule, which is here supposed to be produced between a Dianthus superbus, and the Garyophyllus, Clove. The Dianthus superbus emits a most fragrant odour, particularly at night. Vegetable mules supply an irrefragable argument in favour of the sexual system of botany. They are said to be numerous; and, like the mules of the animal kingdom, not always to continue their species by seed. There is an account of a curious mule from the Antirrbinum linaria, Toad-flax, in the Amoenit. Academ. V. I. No. 3. and many hybrid plants described in No. 32. The Urtica alienata is an evergreen plant, which appears to be a nettle from the male flowers, and a Pellitory (Parietaria) from the female ones and the fruit; and is hence between both. Murray, Syft. Veg. Amongst the English indigenous plants, the veronica hybrida mule Speedwel is supposed to have originated from the officinal one; and the spiked one, and the Sibthorpia Europ�a to have for its parents the golden saxifrage and marsh pennywort. Pulteney's View of Linneus, p. 250. Mr. Graberg, Mr. Schreber, and Mr. Ramstrom, seem of opinion, that the internal structure or parts of fructification in mule-plants resemble the female parent; but that the habit or external structure resembles the male parent. See treatises under the above names in V. VI. Am�nit. Academic. The mule produced from a horse and the ass resembles the horse externally with his ears, main, and tail; but with the nature or manners of an ass: but the Hinnus, or creature produced from a male ass, and a mare, resembles the father externally in stature, ash-colour, and the black cross, but with the nature or manners of a horse. The breed from Spanish rams and Swedish ewes resembled the Spanish sheep in wool, stature, and external form; but was as hardy as the Swedish sheep; and the contrary of those which were produced from Swedish rams and Spanish ewes. The offspring from the male goat of Angora and the Swedish female goat had long soft camel's hair; but that from the male Swedish goat, and the female one of Angora, had no improvement of their wool. An English ram without horns, and a Swedish horned ewe, produced sheep without horns. Amoen. Academ. V. VI. p. 13.]


 With sighs and sorrows her compassion moves,
 And wins the damsel to illicit loves.
 The Monster-offspring heirs the father's pride,
 Mask'd in the damask beauties of the bride.
 305 So, when the Nightingale in eastern bowers
 On quivering pinion woos the Queen of flowers;
 Inhales her fragrance, as he hangs in air,
 And melts with melody the blushing fair;
 Half-rose, half-bird, a beauteous Monster springs,
 310 Waves his thin leaves, and claps his glossy wings;
 Long horrent thorns his mossy legs surround,
 And tendril-talons root him to the ground;
 Green films of rind his wrinkled neck o'espread,
 And crimson petals crest his curled head;
 315 Soft-warbling beaks in each bright blossom move,
 And vocal Rosebuds thrill the enchanted grove!--
 Admiring Evening stays her beamy star,
 And still Night listens from his ebon ear;
 While on white wings descending Houries throng,
 320 And drink the floods of odour and of song.

 When from his golden urn the Solstice pours
 O'er Afric's sable sons the sultry hours;
 When not a gale flits o'er her tawny hills,
 Save where the dry Harmattan breathes and kills;


 [The dry Harmattan. l. 324. The Harmattan is a singular wind blowing from the interior parts of Africa to the Atlantic ocean, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for several days without regular periods. It is always attended with a fog or haze, so dense as to render those objects invisible which are at the distance of a quarter of a mile; the sun appears through it only about noon, and then of a dilute red, and very minute particles subside from the misty air so as to make the grass, and the skins of negroes appear whitish. The extreme dryness which attends this wind or fog, without dews, withers and quite dries the leaves of vegetables; and is said of Dr. Lind at some seasons to be fatal and malignant to mankind; probably after much preceding wet, when it may become loaded with the exhalations from putrid marshes; at other seasons it is said to check epidemic diseases, to cure fluxes, and to heal ulcers and cutaneous eruptions; which is probably effected by its yielding no moisture to the mouths of the external absorbent vessels, by which the action of the other branches of the absorbent system is increased to supply the deficiency. Account of the Harmattan. Phil. Transact. V. LXXI.

 The Rev. Mr. Sterling gives an account of a darkness for six or eight hours at Detroit in America, on the 19th of October, 1762, in which the sun appeared as red as blood, and thrice its usual size: some rain falling, covered white paper with dark drops, like sulphur or dirt, which burnt like wet gunpowder, and the air had a very sulphureous smell. He supposes this to have been emitted from some distant earthquake or volcano. Philos. Trans. V. LIII. p. 63.

 In many circumstances this wind seems much to resemble the dry fog which covered most parts of Europe for many weeks in the summer of 1780, which has been supposed to have had a volcanic origin, as it succeeded the violent eruption of Mount Hecla, and its neighbourhood. From the subsidence of a white powder, it seems probable that the Harmattan has a similar origin, from the unexplored mountains of Africa. Nor is it improbable, that the epidemic coughs, which occasionally traverse immense tracts of country, may be the products of volcanic eruptions; nor impossible, that at some future time contagious miasmata may be thus emitted from subterraneous furnaces, in such abundance as to contaminate the whole atmosphere, and depopulate the earth!]


 325 When stretch'd in dust her gasping panthers lie,
 And writh'd in foamy folds her serpents die;
 Indignant Atlas mourns his leafless woods,
 And Gambia trembles for his sinking floods;
 Contagion stalks along the briny sand,
 330 And Ocean rolls his sickening shoals to land.


 [His sickening shoals. 330. Mr. Marsden relates, that in the island of Sumatra, during the November of 1775, the dry monsoons, or S.E. winds, continued so much longer than usual, that the large rivers became dry; and prodigious quantities of sea-fish, dead and dying, were seen floating for leagues on the sea, and driven on the beach by the tides. This was supposed to have been caused by the great evaporation, and the deficiency of fresh water rivers having rendered the sea too fast for its inhabitants. The season then became so sickly as to destroy great numbers of people, both foreigners and natives. Phil. Trans. V. LXXI. p. 384.]


 --Fair CHUNDA smiles amid the burning waste,
 Her brow unturban'd, and her zone unbrac'd;
 Ten brother-youths with light umbrella's shade,
 Or fan with busy hands the panting maid;
 335 Loose wave her locks, disclosing, as they break,
 The rising bosom and averted cheek;


 [Chunda. l. 331. Chundali Borrum is the name which the natives give to this plant; it is the Hedylarum gyrans, or moving plant; its class is two brotherhoods, ten males. Its leaves are continually in spontaneous motion; some rising and others falling; and others whirling circularly by twisting their stems; this spontaneous movement of the leaves, when the air is quite still and very warm, seems to be necessary to the plant, at perpetual respiration is to animal life. A more particular account, with a good print of the Hedyfarum gyrans is given by M. Brouffonet in a paper on vegetable motions in the Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences. Ann. 1784, p. 609.

 There are many other instances of spontaneous movements of the parts of vegetables. In the Marchantia polymorpha some yellow wool proceeds from the flower-bearing anthers, which moves spontaneously in the anther, while it drops its dust like atoms. Murray, Syst. Veg. See note on Collinfonia for other instances of vegetable spontaneity. Add to this, that as the sleep of animals consists in a suspension of voluntary motion, and as vegetables are likewise subject to sleep, there is reason to conclude, that the various actions of opening and closing their petals and foliage may be justly ascribed to a voluntary power: for without the faculty of volition, sleep would not have been, necessary to them.]

 [Illustration: Hedysarum gyrans.]


 Clasp'd round her ivory neck with studs of gold
 Flows her thin vest in many a gauzy fold;
 O'er her light limbs the dim transparence plays,
 340 And the fair form, it seems to hide, betrays.

 Where leads the northern Star his lucid train
 High o'er the snow-clad earth, and icy main,
 With milky light the white horizon streams,
 And to the moon each sparkling mountain gleams.--
 345 Slow o'er the printed snows with silent walk
 Huge shaggy forms across the twilight stalk;
 And ever and anon with hideous sound
 Burst the thick ribs of ice, and thunder round.--
 There, as old Winter slaps his hoary wing,
 350 And lingering leaves his empire to the Spring,
 Pierced with quick shafts of silver-shooting light
 Fly in dark troops the dazzled imps of night--


 [Burst the thick rib of ice. l. 348. The violent cracks of ice heard from the Glaciers seem to be caused by some of the snow being melted in the middle of the day; and the water thus produced running down into vallies of ice, and congealing again in a few hours, forces off by its expansion large precipices from the ice-mountains.]


 "Awake, my Love!" enamour'd MUSCHUS cries,
 "Stretch thy fair limbs, resulgent Maid! arise;
 355 Ope thy sweet eye-lids to the rising ray,
 And hail with ruby lips returning day.
 Down the white hills dissolving torrents pour,
 Green springs the turf, and purple blows the flower;
 His torpid wing the Rail exulting tries,
 360 Mounts the soft gale, and wantons in the skies;
 Rise, let us mark how bloom the awaken'd groves,
 And 'mid the banks of roses hide our loves."


 [Muschus. l. 353. Corallinus, or lichen rangiferinus. Coral-moss. Clandestine-marriage. This moss vegetates beneath the snow, where the degree of heat is always about 40; that is, in the middle between the freezing point, and the common heat of the earth; and is for many months of the winter the sole food of the rain-deer, who digs furrows in the snow to find it: and as the milk and flesh of this animal is almost the only sustenance which can be procured during the long winters of the higher latitudes, this moss may be said to support some millions of mankind.

 The quick vegetation that occurs on the solution of the snows in high latitudes appears very astonishing; it seems to arise from two causes,
 1. the long continuance of the approaching sun above the horizon;
 2. the increased irritability of plants which have been long exposed to the cold. See note on Anemone.

 All the water-fowl on the lakes of Siberia are said by Professor Gmelin to retreat Southwards on the commencement of the frosts, except the Rail, which sleeps buried in the snow. Account of Siberia.]


 Night's tinsel beams on smooth Lock-lomond dance,
 Impatient �GA views the bright expanse;--
 365 In vain her eyes the parting floods explore,
 Wave after wave rolls freightless to the shore.
 --Now dim amid the distant foam she spies
 A rising speck,--"'tis he! 'tis he!" She cries;
 As with firm arms he beats the streams aside,
 370 And cleaves with rising chest the tossing tide,
 With bended knee she prints the humid sands,
 Up-turns her glistening eyes, and spreads her hands;
 --"'Tis he, 'tis he!--My Lord, my life, my love!--
 Slumber, ye winds; ye billows, cease to move!
 375 beneath his arms your buoyant plumage spread,
 Ye Swans! ye Halcyons! hover round his head!"--


 [�ga l. 364. Conserva �gagropila. It is found loose in many lakes in a globular form, from the size of a walnut to that of a melon, much resembling the balls of hair found in the stomachs of cows; it adheres to nothing, but rolls from one part of the lake to another. The Conserva vagabunda dwells on the European seas, travelling along in the midst of the waves; (Spec. Plant.) These may not improperly be called itinerant vegetables. In a similar manner the Fucus natans (swimming) strikes no roots into the earth, but floats on the sea in very extensive masses, and may be said to be a plant of passage, as it is wafted by the winds from one shore to another.]


 --With eager step the boiling surf she braves,
 And meets her refluent lover in the waves;
 Loose o'er the flood her azure mantle swims,
 380 And the clear stream betrays her snowy limbs.

 So on her sea-girt tower fair HERO stood
 At parting day, and mark'd the dashing flood;
 While high in air, the glimmering rocks above,
 Shone the bright lamp, the pilot-star of Love.
 385 --With robe outspread the wavering flame behind
 She kneels, and guards it from the shifting wind;
 Breathes to her Goddess all her vows, and guides
 Her bold LEANDER o'er the dusky tides;
 Wrings his wet hair, his briny bosom warms,
 390 And clasps her panting lover in her arms.

 Deep, in wide caverns and their shadowy ailes,
 Daughter of Earth, the chaste TRUFFELIA smiles;


 [Truffelia. l. 392. (Lycoperdon Tuber) Truffle. Clandestine marriage. This fungus never appears above ground, requiring little air, and perhaps no light. It is found by dogs or swine, who hunt it by the smell. Other plants, which have no buds or branches on their stems, as the grasses, shoot out numerous stoles or scions underground; and this the more, as their tops or herbs are eaten by cattle, and thus preserve themselves,]


 On silvery beds, of soft asbestus wove,
 Meets her Gnome-husband, and avows her love.
 395 --High o'er her couch impending diamonds blaze,
 And branching gold the crystal roof inlays;
 With verdant light the modest emeralds glow,
 Blue sapphires glare, and rubies blush, below;
 Light piers of lazuli the dome surround,
 400 And pictured mochoes tesselate the ground;

 In glittering threads along reflective walls
 The warm rill murmuring twinkles, as it falls;
 Now sink the Eolian strings, and now they swell,
 And Echoes woo in every vaulted cell;
 405 While on white wings delighted Cupids play,
 Shake their bright lamps, and shed celestial day.

 Closed in an azure fig by fairy spells,
 Bosom'd in down, fair CAPRI-FICA dwells;--


 [Caprificus. l. 408 Wild fig. The fruit of the fig is not a seed-vessel, but a receptacle inclosing the flower within it. As these trees bear some male and others female flowers, immured on all sides by the fruit, the manner of their fecundation was very unintelligible, till Tournefort and Pontedera discovered, that a kind of gnat produced in the male figs carried the fecundating dust on its wings, (Cynips Psenes Syst. Nat. 919.), and, penetrating the female fig, thus impregnated the flowers; for the evidence of this wonderful fact, see the word Caprification, in Milne's Botanical Dictionary. The figs of this country are all female, and their seeds not prolific; and therefore they can only be propagated by layers and suckers.

 Monsieur de la Hire has shewn in the Memoir, de l'Academ. de Science, that the summer figs of Paris, in Provence, Italy, and Malta, have all perfect stamina, and ripen not only their fruits, but their seed; from which seed other fig-trees are raised; but that the stamina of the autumnal figs are abortive, perhaps owing to the want of due warmth. Mr. Milne, in his Botanical Dictionary (art. Caprification), says, that the cultivated fig-trees have a few male flowers placed above the female within the same covering or receptacle; which in warmer climates perform their proper office, but in colder ones become abortive: And Linneus observes, that some figs have the navel of the receptacle open; which was one reason that induced him to remove this plant from the class Clandestine Marriage to the class Polygamy. Lin. Spec. Plant.

 From all these circumstances I should conjecture, that those female fig-flowers, which are closed on all sides in the fruit or receptacle without any male ones, are monsters, which have been propagated for their fruit, like barberries, and grapes without seeds in them; and that the Caprification is either an ancient process of imaginary use, and blindly followed in some countries, or that it may contribute to ripen the fig by decreasing its vigour, like cutting off a circle of the bark from the branch of a pear-tree. Tournefort seems inclined to this opinion; who says, that the figs in Provence and at Paris ripen sooner, if their buds be pricked with a straw dipped in olive-oil. Plumbs and pears punctured by some insects ripen sooner, and the part round the puncture is sweeter.
 Is not the honey-dew produced by the puncture of insects? will not wounding the branch of a pear-tree, which is too vigorous, prevent the blossoms from falling off; as from some fig-trees the fruit is said to fall off unless they are wounded by caprification? I had last spring six young trees of the Ischia fig with fruit on them in pots in a stove; on removing them into larger boxes, they protruded very vigorous shoots, and the figs all fell off; which I ascribed to the increased vigour of the plants.]


 So sleeps in silence the Curculio, shut
 410 In the dark chambers of the cavern'd nut,
 Erodes with ivory beak the vaulted shell,
 And quits on filmy wings its narrow cell.
 So the pleased Linnet in the moss-wove nest,
 Waked into life beneath its parent's breast,
 415 Chirps in the gaping shell, bursts forth erelong,
 Shakes its new plumes, and tries its tender song.--
 --And now the talisman she strikes, that charms
 Her husband-Sylph,--and calls him to her arms.--
 Quick, the light Gnat her airy Lord bestrides,
 420 With cobweb reins the flying courser guides,
 From crystal steeps of viewless ether springs,
 Cleaves the soft air on still expanded wings;
 Darts like a sunbeam o'er the boundless wave,
 And seeks the beauty in her secret cave.
 425 So with quick impulse through all nature's frame
 Shoots the electric air its subtle flame.
 So turns the impatient needle to the pole,
 Tho' mountains rise between, and oceans roll.
 Where round the Orcades white torrents roar,
 430 Scooping with ceaseless rage the incumbent shore,
 Wide o'er the deep a dusky cavern bends
 Its marble arms, and high in air impends;
 Basaltic piers the ponderous roof sustain,
 And steep their massy sandals in the main;
 435 Round the dim walls, and through the whispering ailes
 Hoarse breathes the wind, the glittering water boils.
 Here the charm'd BYSSUS with his blooming bride
 Spreads his green sails, and braves the foaming tide;
 The star of Venus gilds the twilight wave,
 440 And lights her votaries to the secret cave;
 Light Cupids flutter round the nuptial bed,
 And each coy sea-maid hides her blushing head.


 [Basaltic piers. l. 433. This description alludes to the cave of Fingal in the island of Staffa. The basaltic columns, which compose the Giants Causeway on the coast of Ireland, as well as those which support the cave of Fingal, are evidently of volcanic origin, as is well illustrated in an ingenious paper of Mr. Keir, in the Philos. Trans. who observed in the glass, which had been long in a fusing heat at the bottom of the pots in the glass-houses at Stourbridge, that crystals were produced of a form similar to the parts of the basaltic columns of the Giants Causeway.]

 [Byssus. 437. Clandestine Marriage. It floats on the sea in the day, and sinks a little during the night; it is found in caverns on the northern shores, of a pale green colour, and as thin as paper.]


 Where cool'd by rills, and curtain'd round by woods,
 Slopes the green dell to meet the briny floods,
 445 The sparkling noon-beams trembling on the tide,
 The PROTEUS-LOVER woos his playful bride,
 To win the fair he tries a thousand forms,
 Basks on the sands, or gambols in the storms.
 A Dolphin now, his scaly sides he laves,
 450 And bears the sportive damsel on the waves;
 She strikes the cymbal as he moves along,
 And wondering Ocean listens to the song.
 --And now a spotted Pard the lover stalks,
 Plays round her steps, and guards her favour'd walks;


 [The Proteus-love. l. 446. Conserva polymorpha. This vegetable is put amongst the cryptogamia, or clandestine marriages, by Linneus; but, according to Mr. Ellis, the males and females are on different plants. Philos. Trans. Vol. LVII. It twice changes its colour, from red to brown, and then to black; and changes its form by losing its lower leaves, and elongating some of the upper ones, so as to be mistaken by the unskilful for different plants. It grows on the shores of this country.

 There is another plant, Medicago polymorpha, which may be said to assume a great variety of shapes; as the seed-vessels resemble sometimes snail-horns, at other times caterpillars with or without long hair upon them; by which means it is probable they sometimes elude the depredations of those insects. The seeds of Calendula, Marygold, bend up like a hairy caterpillar, with their prickles bridling outwards, and may thus deter some birds or insects from preying upon them. Salicornia also assumes an animal similitude. Phil. Bot. p. 87. See note on Iris in additional notes; and Cypripedia in Vol. I.]


 455 As with white teeth he prints her hand, caress'd,
 And lays his velvet paw upon her breast,
 O'er his round face her snowy fingers strain
 The silken knots, and fit the ribbon-rein.
 --And now a Swan, he spreads his plumy sails,
 460 And proudly glides before the fanning gales;
 Pleas'd on the flowery brink with graceful hand
 She waves her floating lover to the land;
 Bright shines his sinuous neck, with crimson beak
 He prints fond kisses on her glowing cheek,
 465 Spreads his broad wings, elates his ebon crest,
 And clasps the beauty to his downy breast.

 A hundred virgins join a hundred swains,
 And fond ADONIS leads the sprightly trains;


 [Adonis. l. 468. Many males and many females live together in the same flower. It may seem a solecism in language, to call a flower, which contains many of both sexes, an individual; and the more so to call a tree or shrub an individual, which consists of so many flowers. Every tree, indeed, ought to be considered as a family or swarm of its respective buds; but the buds themselves seem to be individual plants; because each has leaves or lungs appropriated to it; and the bark of the tree is only a congeries of the roots of all these individual buds. Thus hollow oak-trees and willows are often seen with the whole wood decayed and gone; and yet the few remaining branches flourish with vigour; but in respect to the male and female parts of a flower, they do not destroy its individuality any more than the number of paps of a sow, or the number of her cotyledons, each of which includes one of her young.

 The society, called the Areoi, in the island of Otaheite, consists of about 100 males and 100 females, who form one promiscuous marriage.]


 Pair after pair, along his sacred groves
 470 To Hymen's fane the bright procession moves;
 Each smiling youth a myrtle garland shades,
 And wreaths of roses veil the blushing maids;
 Light joys on twinkling feet attend the throng,
 Weave the gay dance, or raise the frolic song;
 475 --Thick, as they pass, exulting Cupids fling
 Promiscuous arrows from the sounding string;
 On wings of gossamer soft Whispers fly,
 And the sly Glance steals side-long from the eye.
 --As round his shrine the gaudy circles bow,
 480 And seal with muttering lips the faithless vow,
 Licentious Hymen joins their mingled hands,
 And loosely twines the meretricious bands.--
 Thus where pleased VENUS, in the southern main,
 Sheds all her smiles on Otaheite's plain,

 485 Wide o'er the isle her silken net she draws,
 And the Loves laugh at all, but Nature's laws."

 Here ceased the Goddess,--o'er the silent strings
 Applauding Zephyrs swept their fluttering wings;
 Enraptur'd Sylphs arose in murmuring crowds
 490 To air-wove canopies and pillowy clouds;
 Each Gnome reluctant sought his earthy cell,
 And each bright Floret clos'd her velvet bell.
 Then, on soft tiptoe, NIGHT approaching near
 Hung o'er the tuneless lyre his sable ear;
 495 Gem'd with bright stars the still etherial plain,
 And bad his Nightingales repeat the strain.
