Not only sun-kissed heights are fair.Below
The cold, dark billows of the frowning deep
Do lovely blossoms of the ocean sleep,
Rocked gently by the waters to and fro.
The coral beds with magic colours glow,
 And priceless pearl-encrusted molluscs heap
 The glittering rocks where shining atoms leap
Like living broken rainbows.

Even so
We find the sea of sorrow.Black as night
 The sullen surface meets our frightened gaze,
As down we sink to darkness and despair.
But at the depths -such beauty! such delight!
 Such flowers as never grew in pleasure's ways!
Ah! not alone are sun-kissed summits fair.
