 Ho! it's come, kids, come!
 "With a bim! bam! bum!
 Here's little Billy bangin' on his big bass drum!
 He's a-marchin' round the room,
 With his feather-duster plume
 A-noddin' an' a-bobbin' with his bim! bom! boom!

 Looky, little Jane an' Jim!
 Will you only look at him,
 A-humpin' an' a-thumpin' with his bam! bom! bim!
 Has the Day o' Judgment come
 Er the New Mi-len-nee-um?
 Er is it only Billy with his bim! bam! bim!


 I 'm a-comin'; yes, I am - 
 Jim an' Sis, an' Jane an' Sam!
 We'll all march off with Billy an' his bom! bim! bam!
 Come hurrawin' as you come,
 Er they'll think you're deef-an'-dumb
 Ef you don't hear little Billy an' his big bass drum!
