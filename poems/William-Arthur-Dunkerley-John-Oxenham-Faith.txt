Lord, give me faith!--to live from day to day,
With tranquil heart to do my simple part,
And, with my hand in Thine, just go Thy way.

Lord, give me faith!--to trust, if not to know;
With quiet mind in all things Thee to find,
And, child-like, go where Thou wouldst have me go.

Lord, give me faith!--to leave it all to Thee,
The future is Thy gift, I would not lift
The vail Thy Love has hung 'twixt it and me.




"I WILL!"


Say once again Thy sweet "I will!"
In answer to my prayers.
"Lord, if Thou wilt!"--
 --"I will!
Rise up above thy cares!"
