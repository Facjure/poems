title: I Will Not Let Thee Go.
---

Nay, I will not let thee go,
Though the midnight glideth slow, - 
Though the darkness deep and long
Dim the sight and hush the song,
On thy tender, faithful breast,
Find I still my perfect rest - 
Soothing sweet for keenest woe - 
And I will not let thee go!

Nay, I will not let thee go,
Though the morn's enkindling glow
Flame along the mountain-height.
Flooding all the hills with light;
What can morning bring to me,
Tender Shepherd, wanting thee?
What its songs but sobs of woe?
Nay, I will not let thee go!

Nay, I will not let thee go,
Though the day no shadows know;
Though, the sky's serene to dim,
Lower no storm-cloud dark and grim;
Whom have I in Heaven but thee? - 
What beside hath earth for me? - 
Thou, the only trust I know, - 
Nay, I will not let thee go!

Let thee go? - my Saviour, nay
Thou my night's unfailing day,
Thou my dawning's tenderest gleam,
Thou my noonday's richest beam, - 
Night is day if thou art near,
Day without thee, joyless, drear, - 
Wanting thee, all bliss were woe, - 
Nay, I will not let thee go!
