title: On Hearing It Said "That It Was Unreasonable To Suppose Man Should Believe What He Could Not Comprehend."
---

"Thou great First Cause," Creator, King, and Lord,
The worm that breathed at Thy commanding word,
And dies whene'er Thou wilt, presumptuous man,
Has dared the mazes of Thy path to scan;
Guided by reason's powerless rays alone,
Would pierce the veil of mystery round Thee thrown.

Tell me, proud being! flutterer of an hour 
(Who thus would comprehend creative power),
Why worlds were made, why man was formed at all,
Or crimeless once, permitted then to fall,
The why, the wherefore, boots not us to know,
Enough that God ordained it to be so.

Go thou, and cull the simplest flower that blows,
The hillside daisy or the wilding rose,
And tell me why so bright their hues appear,
Why they return with each revolving year;
Or how, when countless worlds are all in bloom,
O'er every bud is breathed its own perfume.
Yes, solve me this, and I'll believe with thee,
'Twas meant that man should doubt all mystery.

Presumptuous worm! enough to know is given 
'Tis fearful meddling with the things of Heaven;
Its sacred mysteries belong alone
To Him whose paths are awful and unknown;
Who wings the storm, or whispers "Peace, be still;"
Cradling to rest the mountain wave at will;
Who for our souls his Son a ransom gave,
And guards "his fold" from childhood to the grave.
Confess, proud man, all his known ways are just,
And what thou canst not fathom "learn to trust."
