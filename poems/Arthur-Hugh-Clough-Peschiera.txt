What voice did on my spirit fall,
Peschiera, when thy bridge I crost?
��Tis better to have fought and lost,
Than never to have fought at all.�

The tricolor, a trampled rag
Lies, dirt and dust; the lines I track
By sentry boxes yellow-black,
Lead up to no Italian flag.

I see the Croat soldier stand
Upon the grass of your redoubts;
The eagle with his black wings flouts
The breath and beauty of your land.

Yet not in vain, although in vain,
O� men of Brescia, on the day
Of loss past hope, I heard you say
Your welcome to the noble pain.

You say, �Since so it is, good bye
Sweet life, high hope; but whatsoe�er
May be, or must, no tongue shall dare
To tell, �The Lombard feared to die!��

You said (there shall be answer fit),
�And if our children must obey,
They must; but thinking on this day
�Twill less debase them to submit.�

You said (Oh not in vain you said),
�Haste, brothers, haste, while yet we may;
The hours ebb fast of this one day
When blood may yet be nobly shed.�

Ah! not for idle hatred, not
For honour, fame, nor self-applause,
But for the glory of the cause,
You did, what will not be forgot.

And though the stranger stand, �tis true,
By force and fortune�s right he stands;
By fortune, which is in God�s hands,
And strength, which yet shall spring in you.

This voice did on my spirit fall,
Peschiera, when thy bridge I crost,
��Tis better to have fought and lost,
Than never to have fought at all.�
