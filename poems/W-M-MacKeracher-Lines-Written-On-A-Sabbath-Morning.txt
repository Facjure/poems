title: Lines Written On A Sabbath Morning.
---

The snow lies pure and peaceful on the ground,
Serenely smiles the azure sky o'erhead:
The Sabbath spirit dwells on all around,
And weekly toils and discords all are fled.

But, ah! my soul is filled with worldly thought,
My God, 'tis filled with thoughts of self and sin:
With seeming care and trouble it is fraught,
And peaceless discontentment reigns within.

Send down from heaven the Spirit of Thy love,
Its soothing influence in my soul instil;
Uplift my worldly thoughts to things above,
Subserve my wishes to Thy better will.
