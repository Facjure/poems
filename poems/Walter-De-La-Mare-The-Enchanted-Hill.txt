 From height of noon, remote and still,
 The sun shines on the empty hill.
 No mist, no wind, above, below;
 No living thing strays to and fro.
 No bird replies to bird on high,
 Cleaving the skies with echoing cry.
 Like dreaming water, green and wan,
 Glassing the snow of mantling swan,
 Like a clear jewel encharactered
 With secret symbol of line and word,
 Asheen, unruffled, slumbrous, still,
 The sunlight streams on the empty hill.

 But soon as Night's dark shadows ride
 Across its shrouded Eastern side,
 When at her kindling, clear and full,
 Star beyond star stands visible;
 Then course pale phantoms, fleet-foot deer
 Lap of its waters icy-clear;
 Mounts the large moon, and pours her beams
 On bright-fish-flashing, singing streams;
 Voices re-echo; coursing by,
 Horsemen, like clouds, wheel silently.
 Glide then from out their pitch-black lair
 Beneath the dark's ensilvered arch,
 Witches becowled into the air;
 And iron pine and emerald larch,
 Tents of delight for ravished bird,
 Are by loud music thrilled and stirred.
 Winging the light, with silver feet,
 Beneath their bowers of fragrance met,
 In dells of rose and meadowsweet,
 In mazed dance the fairies flit;
 While drives his share the Ploughman high
 Athwart the daisy-powdered sky:
 Till far away, in thickening dew,
 Piercing the Eastern shadows through
 Rilling in crystal clear and still,
 Light 'gins to tremble on the hill.
 And like a mist on faint winds borne,
 Silent, forlorn, wells up the morn.
 Then the broad sun with burning beams
 Steeps slope and peak and gilded streams.
 Then no foot stirs; the brake shakes not;
 Soundless and wet in its green grot
 As if asleep, the leaf hangs limp;
 The white dews drip untrembling down,
 From bough to bough, orblike, unblown;
 And in strange quiet, shimmering and still,
 Morning enshrines the empty hill.
