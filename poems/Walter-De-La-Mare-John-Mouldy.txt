 I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
 Deep down twenty steps of stone;
 In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
Smiling there alone.

 He read no book, he snuffed no candle;
 The rats ran in, the rats ran out;
 And far and near, the drip of water
Went whisp'ring about.

 The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,
 I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,
 I saw a slim brown rat of Norway
Creep over him.

 I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,
 Deep down twenty steps of stone;
 In the dusk he sat a-smiling,
Smiling there alone.
