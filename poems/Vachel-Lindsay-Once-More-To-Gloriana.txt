title: Once More - To Gloriana

 Girl with the burning golden eyes,
 And red-bird song, and snowy throat:
 I bring you gold and silver moons
 And diamond stars, and mists that float.
 I bring you moons and snowy clouds,
 I bring you prairie skies to-night
 To feebly praise your golden eyes
 And red-bird song, and throat so white.
