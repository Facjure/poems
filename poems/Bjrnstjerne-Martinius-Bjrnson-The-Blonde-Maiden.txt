title: The Blonde Maiden

Though she depart, a vision flitting,
 If I these thoughts in words exhale:
I love you, you blonde maiden, sitting
 Within your pure white beauty's veil.
 I love you for your blue eyes dreaming,
Like moonlight moving over snow,
 And 'mid the far-off forests beaming
On something hid I may not know.

I love this forehead's fair perfection
 Because it stands so starry-clear,
In flood of thought sees its reflection
 And wonders at the image near.
 I love these locks in riot risen
Against the hair-net's busy bands;
 To free them from their pretty prison
Their sylphs entice my eyes and hands.

I love this figure's supple swinging
 In rhythm of its bridal song,
Of strength and life-joy daily singing
 With youthful yearnings deep and long.
 I love this foot so lightly bearing
The glory of sure victory
 Through youth's domain of merry daring
To meet first-love that hers shall be.

I love these hands, these lips enchanting,
 With them the God of love's allied,
With them the apple-prize is granting,
 But guards them, too, lest aught betide.
 I love you and must say it ever,
Although you heed not what you've heard,
 But flee and answer: maidens never
May put their trust in poet's word.
