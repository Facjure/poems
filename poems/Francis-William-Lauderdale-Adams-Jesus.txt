 Where is poor Jesus gone?
He sits with Dives now,
 And not even the crumbs are flung
To Lazarus below.

 Where is poor Jesus gone?
Is he with Magdalen?
 He doles her one by one
Her wages of shame!

 Where is poor Jesus gone?
The good Samaritan,
 What does he there alone?
He stabs the wounded man!

 Where is poor Jesus gone,
The lamb they sacrificed?
 They've made God of his carrion
And labelled it "Christ!"
