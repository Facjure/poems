title: Spring and Fall: to a young child
---

M�rgar�t, �re you gr�eving
Over Goldengrove unleaving?
Le�ves, like the things of man, you
With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?
�h! �s the heart grows older
It will come to such sights colder
By and by, nor spare a sigh
Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie;
And yet you w�ll weep and know why.
Now no matter, child, the name:
S�rrow's spr�ngs �re the same.
Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed
What heart heard of, ghost guessed:
It is the blight man was born for,
It is Margaret you mourn for.
