 (Air: �The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane.�)


I�m a broken-down old squatter, my cash it is all gone,
Of troubles and bad seasons I complain;
My cattle are all mortgaged, of horses I have none,
And I�ve lost that little freehold on the plain.

 Chorus

 The stockyard�s broken down, and the woolshed�s tumbling in;
 I�ve written to the mortgagees in vain;
 My wool it is all damaged and it is not worth a pin,
 And I�ve lost that little freehold on the plain.

I commenced life as a squatter some twenty years ago,
When fortune followed in my train;
But I speculated heavy and I�d have you all to know
That I�ve lost that little freehold on the plain.

 Chorus: The stockyard�s broken down, &amp;c.

I built myself a mansion, and chose myself a wife;
Of her I have no reason to complain;
For I thought I had sufficient to last me all my life,
But I�ve lost that little freehold on the plain.

 Chorus: The stockyard�s broken down, &amp;c.

And now I am compelled to take a drover�s life,
To drive cattle through the sunshine and the rain,
And to leave her behind me, my own dear loving wife�
We were happy on that freehold on the plain.

 Chorus: The stockyard�s broken down, &amp;c.
