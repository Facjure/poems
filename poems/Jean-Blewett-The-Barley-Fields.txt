title: The Barley Fields.

The sunset has faded, there's but a tinge,
 Saffron pale, where a star of white
Has tangled itself in the trailing fringe
 Of the pearl-gray robe of the summer night.

O the green of the barley fields grows deep,
 The breath of the barley fields grows rare;
There is rustle and glimmer, sway and sweep - 
 The wind is holding high revel there,

Singing the song it has often sung - 
 Hark to the troubadour glad and bold:
"Sweet is the earth when the summer is young
 And the barley fields are green and gold!"
