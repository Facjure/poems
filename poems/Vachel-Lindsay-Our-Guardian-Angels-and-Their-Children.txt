title: Our Guardian Angels and Their Children
---

 Where a river roars in rapids
 And doves in maples fret,
 Where peace has decked the pastures
 Our guardian angels met.

 Long they had sought each other
 In God's mysterious name,
 Had climbed the solemn chaos tides
 Alone, with hope aflame:

 Amid the demon deeps had wound
 By many a fearful way.
 As they beheld each other
 Their shout made glad the day.

 No need of purse delayed them,
 No hand of friend or kin - 
 Nor menace of the bell and book,
 Nor fear of mortal sin.

 You did not speak, my girl,
 At this, our parting hour.
 Long we held each other
 And watched their deeds of power.

 They made a curious Eden.
 We saw that it was good.
 We thought with them in unison.
 We proudly understood

 Their amaranth eternal,
 Their roses strange and fair,
 The asphodels they scattered
 Upon the living air.

 They built a house of clouds
 With skilled immortal hands.
 They entered through the silver doors.
 Their wings were wedded brands.

 I labored up the valley
 To granite mountains free.
 You hurried down the river
 To Zidon by the sea.

 But at their place of meeting
 They keep a home and shrine.
 Your angel twists a purple flax,
 Then weaves a mantle fine.

 My angel, her defender
 Upstanding, spreads the light
 On painted clouds of fancy
 And mists that touch the height.

 Their sturdy babes speak kindly
 And fly and run with joy,
 Shepherding the helpless lambs - 
 A Grecian girl and boy.

 These children visit Heaven
 Each year and make of worth
 All we planned and wrought in youth
 And all our tears on earth.

 From books our God has written
 They sing of high desire.
 They turn the leaves in gentleness.
 Their wings are folded fire.
