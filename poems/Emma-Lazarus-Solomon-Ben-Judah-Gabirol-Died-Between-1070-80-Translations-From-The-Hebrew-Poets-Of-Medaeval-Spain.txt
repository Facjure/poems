"Am I sipping the honey of the lips?
Am I drunk with the wine of a kiss?
Have I culled the flowers of the cheek,
Have I sucked the fresh fragrance of the breath?
Nay, it is the Song of Gabirol that has revived me,
The perfume of his youthful, spring-tide breeze."
 - MOSES BEN ESRA.

"I will engrave my songs indelibly upon the heart of
the world, so that no one can efface them."
 - GABIROL.
