 She gropes and hobbies, where the dropsied rocks
 Are hairy with the lichens and the twist
 Of knotted wolf's-bane, mumbling in the mist,
 Hawk-nosed and wrinkle-eyed with scrawny locks.
 At her bent back the sick-faced moonlight mocks,
 Like some lewd evil whom the Fiend hath kissed;
 Thrice at her feet the slipping serpent hissed,
 And thrice the owl called to the forest fox.
 What sabboth brew dost now intend? What root
 Dost seek for, seal for what satanic spell
 Of incantations and demoniac fire?
 From thy rude hut, hill-huddled in the brier,
 What dark familiar points thy sure pursuit,
 With burning eyes, gaunt with the glow of Hell?
