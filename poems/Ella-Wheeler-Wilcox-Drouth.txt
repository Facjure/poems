 Why do we pity those who weep? The pain
 That finds a ready outlet in the flow
 Of salt and bitter tears is blessed woe,
 And does not need our sympathies. The rain
 But fits the shorn field for new yield of grain;
 While the red, brazen skies, the sun's fierce glow,
 The dry, hot winds that from the tropics blow
 Do parch and wither the unsheltered plain.
 The anguish that through long, remorseless years
 Looks out upon the world with no relief
 Of sudden tempests or slow-dripping tears - 
 The still, unuttered, silent, wordless grief
 That evermore doth ache, and ache, and ache - 
 This is the sorrow wherewith hearts do break.
