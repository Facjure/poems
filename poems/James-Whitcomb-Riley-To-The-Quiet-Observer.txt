AFTER HIS LONG SILENCE

 Dear old friend of us all in need
 Who know the worth of a friend indeed,
 How rejoiced are we all to learn
 Of your glad return.

 We who have missed your voice so long -
 Even as March might miss the song
 Of the sugar-bird in the maples when
 They're tapped again.

 Even as the memory of these
 Blended sweets, - the sap of the trees
 And the song of the birds, and the old camp too,
 We think of you.

 Hail to you, then, with welcomes deep
 As grateful hearts may laugh or weep! -
 You give us not only the bird that sings,
 But all good things.
