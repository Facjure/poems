White artist he, who, breezeless nights,
 From tingling stars jocosely whirls,
A harlequin in spangled tights,
 His wand a pot of pounded pearls.

The field a hasty pallet; for,
 In thin or thick, with daub and streak,
It stretches from the barn-gate's bar
 To the bleached ribbon of the creek.

A great geometer is he;
 For, on the creek's diaphanous silk,
Sphere, cone, and star exquisitely
 He's drawn in crystal lines of milk.

Most delicate, his talent keen
 On casement panes he lavishes,
In many a Lilliputian scene
 Of vague white hives and milky bees,

That sparkling in still swarms delight,
 Or bow the jeweled bells of flowers; - 
Of dim, deep landscapes of the night,
 Hanging down limpid domes quaint showers

Of feathery stars and meteors
 Above an upland's glimmering ways,
Where gambol 'neath the feverish stars
 The erl-king and the fleecy fays.

Or last, one arabesque of ferns,
 Chrysanthemums and mistletoe,
And death-pale roses bunched in urns
 That with an innate glory glow.

In leafless woodlands saturnine,
 Where reckless winds, like goblins mad,
Screech swinging in each barren vine,
 His wagship shapes a lesson sad:

When slyly touched by his white hand
 Of Midas-magic, forests old
Dariuses of pomp then stand
 Barbaric-crowned with living gold....

Patrician state, plebeian blood
 Soon foster sybarites, and they,
Squand'ring their riches, wood by wood,
 Die palsied wrecks debauched and gray.
