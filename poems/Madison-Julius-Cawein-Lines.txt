If GOD should say to me, Behold! - 
Yea, who shall doubt? - 
They who love others more than me,
Shall I not turn, as oft of old,
My face from them and cast them out?
So let it be with thee, behold! - 
I should not care, for in your face
Is all GOD'S grace.

If GOD should say to me, Behold! - 
Is it not well? - 
They who have other gods than me,
Shall I not bid them, as of old,
Depart into the outer HELL?
So let it be with thee, behold! - 
I should not care, for in your eyes
Is PARADISE.
