ONCE a boy a Rosebud spied,

Heathrose fair and tender,
All array'd in youthful pride, 
Quickly to the spot he hied,

Ravished by her splendour.
Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

Heathrose fair and tender!

Said the boy, "I'll now pick thee,

Heathrose fair and tender!"
Said the rosebud, "I'll prick thee,
So that thou'lt remember me,

Ne'er will I surrender!"
Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

Heathrose fair and tender!

Now the cruel boy must pick

Heathrose fair and tender;
Rosebud did her best to prick, 
Vain 'twas 'gainst her fate to kick 

She must needs surrender.
Rosebud, rosebud, rosebud red,

Heathrose fair and tender!
