St. Andrews! not for ever thine shall be
 Merely the shadow of a mighty name,
 The remnant only of an ancient fame
Which time has crumbled, as thy rocks the sea.

For thou, to whom was given the earliest key
 Of knowledge in this land (and all men came
 To learn of thee), shalt once more rise and claim
The glory that of right belongs to thee.

Grey in thine age, there yet in thee abides
 The force of youth, to make thyself anew
A name of honour and a place of power.
Arise, then! shake the dust from off thy sides;
 Thou shalt have many where thou now hast few;
Again thou shalt be great.Quick come the hour!
