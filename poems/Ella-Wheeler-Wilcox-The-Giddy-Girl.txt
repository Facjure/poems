[This recitation is intended to be given with an accompaniment of waltz music, introducing dance-steps at the refrain "With one, two, three," etc.]

A giddy young maiden with nimble feet,
Heigh-ho! alack and alas!
Declared she would far rather dance than eat,
And the truth of it came to pass.
For she danced all day and she danced all night;
She danced till the green earth faded white;
She danced ten partners out of breath;
She danced the eleventh one quite to death;
And still she redowaed up and down - 
The giddiest girl in town.
With one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three - kick;
Chassee back, chassee back, whirl around quick.
The name of this damsel ended with E - 
 Heigh-ho; alack and a-day!
And she was as fair as a maiden need be,
 Till she danced her beauty away.
She danced her big toes out of joint;
She danced her other toes all to a point;
She danced out slipper and boot and shoe;
She danced till the bones of her feet came through.
And still she redowaed, waltzed, and whirled - 
The giddiest girl in the world.
With one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three - kick;
Chassee back, chassee back, whirl around quick.

Now the end of my story is sad to relate - 
 Heigh-ho! and away we go!
For this beautiful maiden's final fate
 Is shrouded in gloom and woe.
She danced herself into a patent top;
She whirled and whirled till she could not stop;
She danced and bounded and sprang so far,
That she stuck at last on a pointed star;
And there she must dance till the Judgment Day,
And after it, too, for she danced away
Her soul, you see, so she has no place anywhere out of space,
With her one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three - kick;
Chassee back, chassee back, whirl about quick.
