�So say the foolish!� Say the foolish so, Love?
�Flower she is, my rose� or else, �My very swan is she�
Or perhaps, �Yon maid-moon, blessing earth below, Love,
That art thou!� to them, belike: no such vain words from me.

�Hush, rose, blush! no balm like breath,� I chide it:
�Bend thy neck its best, swan, hers the whiter curve!�
Be the moon the moon: my Love I place beside it:
What is she? Her human self, no lower word will serve.
