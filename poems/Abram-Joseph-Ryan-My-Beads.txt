Sweet, blessed beads! I would not part
 With one of you for richest gem
 That gleams in kingly diadem;
Ye know the history of my heart.

For I have told you every grief
 In all the days of twenty years,
 And I have moistened you with tears,
And in your decades found relief.

Ah! time has fled, and friends have failed
 And joys have died; but in my needs
 Ye were my friends, my blessed beads!
And ye consoled me when I wailed.

For many and many a time, in grief,
 My weary fingers wandered round
 Thy circled chain, and always found
In some Hail Mary sweet relief.

How many a story you might tell
 Of inner life, to all unknown;
 I trusted you and you alone,
But ah! ye keep my secrets well.

Ye are the only chain I wear --
 A sign that I am but the slave,
 In life, in death, beyond the grave,
Of Jesus and His Mother fair.
