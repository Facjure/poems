I.

Storms gather o'er thy path,
Christian! - the sullen, tempest-darkened sky
Grows lurid with the elemental wrath, - 
Say, whither wilt thou fly?

God is my Refuge! - let the tempests come,
They will but speed me sooner to my home!


II.

Night lowers in sullen gloom,
Christian! - a long, dark night awaiteth thee,
Dreary as Egypt's night of fear and doom, - 
Where will thy hiding be?

God is my refuge! - in the dreary night
In Him I dwell, and have abundant light!


III.

Thine is a lonely way,
Christian! - and dangers all thy path infest;
Pitfalls and snares crowd all thy doubtful way, - 
Where is thy place of rest?

God is my Refuge! - safe in Him I move,
And feel no fear, kept by sustaining Love.


IV.

The grave - that dreary place,
Christian, the lonely dwelling in the dust
Awaits thee; 'tis the doom of all thy race, - 
Where, then, shall be thy trust?

God is my refuge! Sweet will be my rest
On the dear pillow that my Saviour pressed!


V.

Alas! - that dreamless sleep - 
Christian, its chains are strong, and hard to break;
All thy belov'd sleep on in silence deep,
And dost thou hope to wake?

God is my refuge! I shall wake and sing - 
"O grave! where is thy vict'ry? - death thy sting?"
