I am tired of this!
 Nothing else but loving!
Nothing else but kiss and kiss,
 Coo, and turtle-doving!
Can't you change the order some?
Hate me just a little - come!

Lay aside your "dears,"
 "Darlings," "kings," and "princes!" -
Call me knave, and dry your tears -
 Nothing in me winces, -
Call me something low and base -
Something that will suit the case!

Wish I had your eyes
 And their drooping lashes!
I would dry their teary lies
 Up with lightning-flashes -
Make your sobbing lips unsheathe
All the glitter of your teeth!

Can't you lift one word -
 With some pang of laughter -
Louder than the drowsy bird
 Crooning 'neath the rafter?
Just one bitter word, to shriek
Madly at me as I speak!

How I hate the fair
 Beauty of your forehead!
How I hate your fragrant hair!
 How I hate the torrid
Touches of your splendid lips,
And the kiss that drips and drips!

Ah, you pale at last!
 And your face is lifted
Like a white sail to the blast,
 And your hands are shifted
Into fists: and, towering thus,
You are simply glorious!

Now before me looms
 Something more than human;
Something more than beauty blooms
 In the wrath of Woman -
Something to bow down before
Reverently and adore.
