Woe, he went galloping into the war,
Clara, Clara!
Let us two dream: shall he �scape with a scar?
Scarcely disfigurement, rather a grace
Making for manhood which nowise we mar:
See, while I kiss it, the flush on his face,
Rosny, Rosny!
Light does he laugh: �With your love in my soul�,
(Clara, Clara!)
�How could I other than, sound, safe, and whole,
Cleave who opposed me asunder, yet stand
Scatheless beside you, as, touching love�s goal,
Who won the race kneels, craves reward at your hand,
Rosny, Rosny?�

Ay, but if certain who envied should see
Clara, Clara.
Certain who simper: �The hero for me
Hardly of life were so chary as miss
Death, death and fame, that�s love�s guerdon when She
Boasts, proud bereaved one, her choice fell on this
Rosny, Rosny!�
So, go on dreaming, he lies mid a heap
(Clara, Clara,)
Of the slain by his hand: what is death but a sleep?
Dead, with my portrait displayed on his breast:
Love wrought in his undoing: �No prudence could keep
The love-maddened wretch from his fate.�
That is best,
Rosny, Rosny.
