title: The South Wind:  A Fisherman's Blessings

O blessed drums of Aldershot!
 O blessed South-west train!
O blessed, blessed Speaker's clock,
 All prophesying rain!

O blessed yaffil, laughing loud!
 O blessed falling glass!
O blessed fan of cold gray cloud!
 O blessed smelling grass!

O bless'd South wind that toots his horn
 Through every hole and crack!
I'm off at eight to-morrow morn,
 To bring such fishes back!

Eversley, April 1, 1856.
