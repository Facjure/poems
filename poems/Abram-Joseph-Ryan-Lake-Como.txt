Winter on the mountains
 Summer on the shore,
The robes of sun-gleams woven,
 The lake's blue wavelets wore.

Cold, white, against the heavens,
 Flashed winter's crown of snow,
And the blossoms of the spring-tide
 Waved brightly far below.

The mountain's head was dreary,
 The cold and cloud were there,
But the mountain's feet were sandaled
 With flowers of beauty rare.

And winding thro' the mountains
 The lake's calm wavelets rolled,
And a cloudless sun was gilding
 Their ripples with its gold.

Adown the lake we glided
 Thro' all the sunlit day;
The cold snows gleamed above us,
 But fair flowers fringed our way

The snows crept down the mountain,
 The flowers crept up the slope,
Till they seemed to meet and mingle,
 Like human fear and hope.

But the same rich, golden sunlight
 Fell on the flowers and snow,
Like the smile of God that flashes
 On hearts in joy or woe.

And on the lake's low margin
 The trees wore stoles of green,
While here and there, amid them,
 A convent cross was seen.

Anon a ruined castle,
 Moss-mantled, loomed in view,
And cast its solemn shadow
 Across the water's blue.

And chapel, cot, and villa,
 Met here and there our gaze,
And many a crumbling tower
 That told of other days.

And scattered o'er the waters
 The fishing boats lay still,
And sound of song so softly
 Came echoed from the hill.

At times the mountain's shadow
 Fell dark across the scene,
And veiled with veil of purple
 The wavelets' silver sheen.

But for a moment only
 The lake would wind, and lo!
The waves would near the glory
 Of the sunlight's brightest glow.

At times there fell a silence
 Unbroken by a tone,
As if no sound of voices
 Had ever there been known.

Through strange and lonely places
 We glided thus for hours;
We saw no other faces
 But the faces of the flowers.

The shores were sad and lonely
 As hearts without a love,
While darker and more dreary
 The mountains rose above.

But sudden round a headland
 The lake would sweep again,
And voices from a village
 Would meet us with their strain.

Thus all the day we glided,
 Until the Vesper bell
Gave to the day, at sunset,
 Its sweet and soft farewell.

Then back again we glided
 Upon our homeward way,
When twilight wrapped the waters
 And the mountains with its gray.

But brief the reign of twilight,
 The night came quickly on;
The dark brow o'er the mountains,
 Star-wreathed, brightly shone.

And down thro' all the shadows
 The star-gleams softly crept,
And kissed, with lips all shining,
 The wavelets ere they slept.

The lake lay in a slumber,
 The shadows for its screen,
While silence waved her sceptre
 Above the sleeping scene.

The spirit of the darkness
 Moved, ghost-like, everywhere;
Wherever starlight glimmered,
 Its shadow, sure, fell there.

The lone place grew more lonely,
 And all along our way
The mysteries of the night-time
 Held undisputed sway.

Thro' silence and thro' darkness
 We glided down the tide
That wound around the mountains
 That rose on either side.

No eyes would close in slumber
 Within our little bark;
What charmed us so in daylight
 So awed us in the dark.

Upon the deck we lingered,
 A whisper scarce was heard;
When hearts are stirred profoundest,
 Lips are without a word.

"Let's say the Chaplet," softly
 A voice beside me spake.
"Christ walked once in the darkness
 Across an Eastern lake,

"And to-night we know the secret
 That will charm Him to our side:
If we call upon His Mother,
 He will meet us on the tide."

So we said the beads together,
 Up and down the little bark;
And I believe that Jesus met us,
 With His Mother, in the dark.

And our prayers were scarcely ended
 When, on mountain-top afar,
We beheld the morning meeting
 With the night's last fading star.

And I left the lake; but never
 Shall the years to come efface
From my heart the dream and vision
 Of that strange and lonely place.
