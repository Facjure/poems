title: Pauline - A Fragment of a Confession
---

Pauline, mine own, bend o�er me thy soft breast
Shall pant to mine bend o�er me thy sweet eyes,
And loosened hair, and breathing lips, arms
Drawing me to thee these build up a screen
To shut me in with thee, and from all fear,
So that I might unlock the sleepless brood
Of fancies from my soul, their lurking place,
Nor doubt that each would pass, ne�er to return
To one so watched, so loved, and so secured.
But what can guard thee but thy naked love?
Ah, dearest; whoso sucks a poisoned wound
Envenoms his own veins, thou art so good,
So calm if thou should�st wear a brow less light
For some wild thought which, but for me, were kept
From out thy soul, as from a sacred star.
Yet till I have unlocked them it were vain
To hope to sing; some woe would light on me;
Nature would point at one, whose quivering lip
Was bathed in her enchantments whose brow burned
Beneath the crown, to which her secrets knelt;
Who learned the spell which can call up the dead,
And then departed, smiling like a fiend
Who has deceived God. If such one should seek
Again her altars, and stand robed and crowned
Amid the faithful: sad confession first,
Remorse and pardon, and old claims renewed,
Ere I can be as I shall be no more.

I had been spared this shame, if I had sate
By thee for ever, from the first, in place
Of my wild dreams of beauty and of good,
Or with them, as an earnest of their truth.
No thought nor hope, having been shut from thee,
No vague wish unexplained no wandering aim
Sent back to bind on Fancy�s wings, and seek
Some strange fair world, where it might be a law;
But doubting nothing, had been led by thee,
Thro� youth, and saved, as one at length awaked,
Who has slept thro� a peril. Ah! vain, vain!

Thou lovest me the past is in its grave,
Tho� its ghost haunts us till this much is ours,
To cast away restraint, lest a worse thing
Wait for us in the darkness. Thou lovest me,
And thou art to receive not love, but faith,
For which thou wilt be mine, and smile, and take
All shapes, and shames, and veil without a fear
That form which music follows like a slave;
And I look to thee, and I trust in thee,
As in a Northern night one looks alway
Unto the East for morn, and spring a joy.
Thou seest then my aimless, hopeless state,
And resting on some few old feelings, won
Back by thy beauty, would�st that I essay
The task, which was to me what now thou art:
And why should I conceal one weakness more?

Thou wilt remember one warm morn, when Winter
Crept aged from the earth, and Spring�s first breath
Blew soft from the moist hills the black-thorn boughs,
So dark in the bare wood; when glistening
In the sunshine were white with coming buds,
Like the bright side of a sorrow and the banks
Had violets opening from sleep like eyes 
I walked with thee, who knew not a deep shame
Lurked beneath smiles and careless words, which sought
To hide it till they wandered and were mute;
As we stood listening on a sunny mound
To the wind murmuring in the damp copse,
Like heavy breathings of some hidden thing
Betrayed by sleep until the feeling rushed
That I was low indeed, yet not so low
As to endure the calmness of thine eyes;
And so I told thee all, while the cool breast
I leaned on altered not its quiet beating;
And long ere words, like a hurt bird�s complaint,
Bade me look up and be what I had been,
I felt despair could never live by thee.
Thou wilt remember: thou art not more dear
Than song was once to me; and I ne�er sung
But as one entering bright halls, where all
Will rise and shout for him Sure I must own
That I am fallen having chosen gifts
Distinct from theirs that I am sad and fain
Would give up all to be but where I was;
Not high as I had been, if faithful found 
But low and weak, yet full of hope, and sure
Of goodness as of life that I would lust
All this gay mastery of mind, to sit
Once more with them, trusting in truth and love.
And with an aim not being what I am.
Oh, Pauline! I am ruined! who believed
That tho� my soul had floated from its sphere
Of wide dominion into the dim orb
Of self that it was strong and free as ever: 
It has conformed itself to that dim orb,
Reflecting all its shades and shapes, and now
Must stay where it alone can be adored.
I have felt this in dreams in dreams in which
I seemed the fate from which I fled; I felt
A strange delight in causing my decay;
I was a fiend, in darkness chained for ever
Within some ocean-cave; and ages rolled,
Till thro� the cleft rock, like a moonbeam, came
A white swan to remain with me; and ages
Rolled, yet I tired not of my first joy
In gazing on the peace of its pure wings.
And then I said, �It is most fair to me,
�Yet its soft wings must sure have suffered change
�From the thick darkness sure its eyes are dim 
�Its silver pinions must be cramped and numbed
�With sleeping ages here; it cannot leave me,
�For it would seem, in light, beside its kind,
�Withered tho� here to me most beautiful.�
And then I was a young witch, whose blue eyes,
As she stood naked by the river springs,
Drew down a god I watched his radiant form
Growing less radiant and it gladdened me;
Till one morn, as he sat in the sunshine
Upon my knees, singing to me of heaven,
He turned to look at me, ere I could lose
The grin with which I viewed his perishing.
And he shrieked and departed, and sat long
By his deserted throne but sunk at last,
Murmuring, as I kissed his lips and curled
Around him, �I am still a god to thee.�
Still I can lay my soul bare in its fall,
For all the wandering and all the weakness
Will he a saddest comment on the song.
And if, that done, I can be young again,
I will give up all gained as willingly
As one gives up a charm which shuts him out
From hope, or part, or care, in human kind.
As life wanes, all its cares, and strife, and toil,
Seem strangely valueless, while the old trees
Which grew by our youth�s home the waving mass
Of climbing plants, heavy with bloom and dew 
The morning swallows with their songs like words, 
All these seem clear and only worth our thoughts.
So aught connected with my early life 
My rude songs or my wild imaginings,
How I look on them most distinct amid
The fever and the stir of after years!

I ne�er had ventured e�en to hope for this,
Had not the glow I felt at His award,
Assured me all was not extinct within.
Him whom all honor whose renown springs up
Like sunlight which will visit all the world;
So that e�en they who sneered at him at first,
Come out to it, as some dark spider crawls
From his foul nest, which some lit torch invades,
Yet spinning still new films for his retreat. 
Thou didst smile, poet, but can we forgive?

Sun-treader life and light be thine for ever;
Thou art gone from us years go by and spring
Gladdens, and the young earth is beautiful,
Yet thy songs come not other bards arise,
But none like thee they stand thy majesties,
Like mighty works which tell some Spirit there
Hath sat regardless of neglect and scorn,
Till, its long task completed, it hath risen
And left us, never to return: and all
Rush in to peer and praise when all in vain.
The air seems bright with thy past presence yet,
But thou art still for me, as thou hast been
When I have stood with thee, as on a throne
With all thy dim creations gathered round
Like mountains, and I felt of mould like them,
And creatures of my own were mixed with them,
Like things half-lived, catching and giving life.
But thou art still for me, who have adored,
Tho� single, panting but to hear thy name,
Which I believed a spell to me alone,
Scarce deeming thou wert as a star to men 
As one should worship long a sacred spring
Scarce worth a moth�s flitting, which long grasses cross,
And one small tree embowers droopingly,
Joying to see some wandering insect won.
To live in its few rushes or some locust
To pasture on its boughs or some wild bird
Stoop for its freshness from the trackless air,
And then should find it but the fountain-head,
Long lost, of some great river washing towns
And towers, and seeing old woods which will live
But by its banks, untrod of human foot,
Which, when the great sun sinks, lie quivering
In light as some thing lieth half of life
Before God�s foot waiting a wondrous change
Then girt with rocks which seek to turn or stay
Its course in vain, for it does ever spread
Like a sea�s arm as it goes rolling on,
Being the pulse of some great country so
Wert thou to me and art thou to the world.
And I, perchance, half feel a strange regret,
That I am not what I have been to thee:
Like a girl one has loved long silently,
In her first loveliness, in some retreat,
When first emerged, all gaze and glow to view
Her fresh eyes, and soft hair, and lips which bleed
Like a mountain berry. Doubtless it is sweet
To see her thus adored but there have been
Moments, when all the world was in his praise,
Sweeter than all the pride of after hours.
Yet, Sun-treader, all hail! from my heart�s heart
I bid thee hail! e�en in my wildest dreams,
I am proud to feel I would have thrown up all
The wreaths of fame which seemed o�er-hanging me,
To have seen thee, for a moment, as thou art.

And if thou livest if thou lovest, spirit!
Remember me, who set this final seal
To wandering thought that one so pure as thou
Could never die. Remember me, who flung
All honor from my soul yet paused and said,
�There is one spark of love remaining yet,
�For I have nought in common with him shapes
�Which followed him avoid me, and foul forms
�Seek me, which ne�er could fasten on his mind;
�And tho� I feel how low I am to him,
�Yet I aim not even to catch a tone
�Of all the harmonies which he called up,
�So one gleam still remains, altho� the last�
Remember me who praise thee e�en with tears,
For never more shall I walk calm with thee;
Thy sweet imaginings are as an air,
A melody, some wond�rous singer sings,
Which, though it haunt men oft in the still eve,
They dream not to essay; yet it no less,
But more is honored. I was thine in shame,
And now when all thy proud renown is out,
I am a watcher, whose eyes have grown dim
With looking for some star which breaks on him,
Altered and worn, and weak, and full of tears.

Autumn has come like Spring returned to us,
Won from her girlishness like one returned
A friend that was a lover nor forgets
The first warm love, but full of sober thoughts
Of fading years; whose soft mouth quivers yet
With the old smile but yet so changed and still!
And here am I the scoffer, who have probed
Life�s vanity, won by a word again
Into my old life for one little word
Of this sweet friend, who lives in loving me,
Lives strangely on my thoughts, and looks, and words,
As fathoms down some nameless ocean thing
Its silent course of quietness and joy
O dearest, if indeed, I tell the past,
May�st thou forget it as a sad sick dream;
Or if it linger my lost soul too soon
Sinks to itself, and whispers, we shall be
But closer linked two creatures whom the earth
Bears singly with strange feelings, unrevealed
But to each other; or two lonely things
Created by some Power, whose reign is done,
Having no part in God, or his bright world,
I am to sing; whilst ebbing day dies soft,
As a lean scholar dies, worn o�er his book,
And in the heaven stars steal out one by one,
As hunted men steal to their mountain watch.
I must not think lest this new impulse die
In which I trust. I have no confidence,
So I will sing on fast as fancies come
Rudely the verse being as the mood it paints.

I strip my mind bare whose first elements
I shall unveil not as they struggled forth
In infancy, nor as they now exist,
That I am grown above them, and can rule them,
But in that middle stage when they were full,
Yet ere I had disposed them to my will;
And then I shall show how these elements
Produced my present state, and what it is.

I am made up of an intensest life,
Of a most clear idea of consciousness
Of self distinct from all its qualities,
From all affections, passions, feelings, powers;
And thus far it exists, if tracked in all,
But linked in me, to self-supremacy,
Existing as a centre to all things,
Most potent to create, and rule, and call
Upon all things to minister to it;
And to a principle of restlessness
Which would be all, have, see, know, taste, feel, all 
This is myself; and I should thus have been,
Though gifted lower than the meanest soul.

And of my powers, one springs up to save
From utter death a soul with such desires
Confined to clay which is the only one
Which marks me an imagination which
Has been an angel to me coming not
In fitful visions, but beside me ever,
And never failing me; so tho� my mind
Forgets not not a shred of life forgets 
Yet I can take a secret pride in calling
The dark past up to quell it regally.

A mind like this must dissipate itself,
But I have always had one lode-star; now,
As I look back, I see that I have wasted,
Or progressed as I looked toward that star 
A need, a trust, a yearning after God,
A feeling I have analysed but late,
But it existed, and was reconciled
With a neglect of all I deemed His laws,
Which yet, when seen in others, I abhorred.
I felt as one beloved, and so shut in
From fear and thence I date my trust in signs
And omens for I saw God everywhere;
And I can only lay it to the fruit
Of a sad after-time that I could doubt
Even His being having always felt
His presence never acting from myself,
Still trusting in a hand that leads me through
All dangers; and this feeling still has fought
Against my weakest reason and resolves.

And I can love nothing and this dull truth
Has come the last but sense supplies a love
Encircling me and mingling with my life.

These make myself for I have sought in vain
To trace how they were formed by circumstance,
For I still find them turning my wild youth
Where they alone displayed themselves, converting
All objects to their use now see their course!

They came to me in my first dawn of life,
Which passed alone with wisest ancient books,
All halo-girt with fancies of my own,
And I myself went with the tale, a god,
Wandering after beauty or a giant,
Standing vast in the sunset an old hunter,
Talking with gods or a high-crested chief,
Sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos; 
I tell you, nought has ever been so clear
As the place, the time, the fashion of those lives.
I had not seen a work of lofty art,
Nor woman�s beauty, nor sweet nature�s face,
Yet, I say, never morn broke clear as those
On the dim clustered isles in the blue sea:
The deep groves, and white temples, and wet caves 
And nothing ever will surprise me now 
Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed,
Who bound my forehead with Proserpine�s hair.
An� strange it is, that I who could so dream,
Should e�er have stooped to aim at aught beneath 
Aught low, or painful, but I never doubted;
So as I grew, I rudely shaped my life
To my immediate wants, yet strong beneath
Was a vague sense of power folded up 
A sense that tho� those shadowy times were past,
Their spirit dwelt in me, and I should rule.

Then came a pause, and long restraint chained down
My soul, till it was changed. I lost myself,
And were it not that I so loathe that time,
I could recall how first I learned to turn
My mind against itself; and the effects,
In deeds for which remorse were vain, as for
The wanderings of delirious dream; yet thence
Came cunning, envy, falsehood, which so long
Have spotted me at length I was restored,
Yet long the influence remained; and nought
But the still life I led, apart from all,
Which left my soul to seek its old delights,
Could e�er have brought me thus far back to peace.
As peace returned, I sought out some pursuit:
And song rose no new impulse but the one
With which all others best could be combined.
My life has not been that of those whose heaven
Was lampless, save where poesy shone out;
But as a clime, where glittering mountain-tops,
And glancing sea, and forests steeped in light,
Give back reflected the far-flashing sun;
For music, (which is earnest of a heaven,
Seeing we know emotions strange by it,
Not else to be revealed) is as a voice,
A low voice calling Fancy, as a friend,
To the green woods in the gay summer time.
And she fills all the way with dancing shapes,
Which have made painters pale; and they go on
While stars look at them, and winds call to them,
As they leave life�s path for the twilight world,
Where the dead gather. This was not at first,
For I scarce knew what I would do. I had
No wish to paint, no yearning but I sang.

And first I sang, as I in dream have seen,
Music wait on a lyrist for some thought,
Yet singing to herself until it came.
I turned to those old times and scenes, where all
That�s beautiful had birth for me, and made
Rude verses on them all; and then I paused 
I had done nothing, so I sought to know
What mind had yet achieved. No fear was mine
As I gazed on the works of mighty bards,
In the first joy at finding my own thoughts
Recorded, and my powers exemplified,
And feeling their aspirings were my own.
And then I first explored passion and mind;
And I began afresh; I rather sought
To rival what I wondered at, than form
Creations of my own; so much was light
Lent back by others, yet much was my own

I paused again a change was coming on,
I was no more a boy the past was breaking
Before the coming, and like fever worked.
I first thought on myself and here my powers
Burst out. I dreamed not of restraint, but gazed
On all things: schemes and systems went and came,
And I was proud (being vainest of the weak),
In wandering o�er them, to seek out some one
To be my own; as one should wander o�er
The white way for a star.

. . . . .

On one, whom praise of mine would not offend,
Who was as calm as beauty being such
Unto mankind as thou to me, Pauline,
Believing in them, and devoting all
His soul�s strength to their winning back to peace;
Who sent forth hopes and longings for their sake,
Clothed in all passion�s melodies, which first
Caught me, and set me, as to a sweet task,
To gather every breathing of his songs,
And woven with them there were words, which seemed
A key to a new world; the muttering
Of angels, of something unguessed by man.
How my heart beat, as I went on, and found
Much there! I felt my own mind had conceived,
But there living and burning; soon the whole
Of his conceptions dawned on me; their praise
Is in the tongues of men; men�s brows are high
When his name means a triumph and a pride;
So my weak hands may well forbear to dim
What then seemed my bright fate: I threw myself
To meet it. I was vowed to liberty,
Men were to be as gods, and earth as heaven.
And I ah! what a life was mine to be,
My whole soul rose to meet it. Now, Pauline,
I shall go mad if I recall that time.

. . . . .

O let me look back, e�er I leave for ever
The time, which was an hour, that one waits
For a fair girl, that comes a withered hag.
And I was lonely far from woods and fields,
And amid dullest sights, who should be loose
As a stag yet I was full of joy who lived
With Plato and who had the key to life.
And I had dimly shaped my first attempt,
And many a thought did I build up on thought,
As the wild bee hangs cell to cell in vain;
For I must still go on: my mind rests not.

�Twas in my plan to look on real life,
Which was all new to me; my theories
Were firm, so I left them, to look upon
Men, and their cares, and hopes, and fears, and joys;
And, as I pondered on them all, I sought
How best life�s end might be attained an end
Comprising every joy. I deeply mused.

And suddenly, without heart-wreck, I awoke
As from a dream I said, �twas beautiful,
Yet but a dream; and so adieu to it.
As some world-wanderer sees in a far meadow
Strange towers, and walled gardens, thick with trees,
Where singing goes on, and delicious mirth,
And laughing fairy creatures peeping over,
And on the morrow, when he comes to live
For ever by those springs, and trees, fruit-flushed
And fairy bowers all his search is vain.
Well I remember . . .
First went my hopes of perfecting mankind,
And faith in them then freedom in itself,
And virtue in itself and then my motives� ends,
And powers and loves; and human love went last.
I felt this no decay, because new powers
Rose as old feelings left wit, mockery,
And happiness; for I had oft been sad.
Mistrusting my resolves: but now I cast
Hope joyously away I laughed and said,
�No more of this� I must not think; at length
I look�d again to see how all went on.

My powers were greater as some temple seemed
My soul, where nought is changed, and incense rolls
Around the altar only God is gone,
And some dark spirit sitteth in His seat!
So I passed through the temple: and to me
Knelt troops of shadows; and they cried, �Hail, king!
�We serve thee now, and thou shalt serve no more!
�Call on us, prove us, let us worship thee!�
And I said, �Are ye strong let fancy bear me
�Far from the past.� And I was borne away
As Arab birds float sleeping in the wind,
O�er deserts, towers, and forests, I being calm;
And I said, �I have nursed up energies,
�They will prey on me.� And a band knelt low,
And cried, �Lord, we are here, and we will make
�A way for thee in thine appointed life
�O look on us!� And I said, �Ye will worship
�Me; but my heart must worship too.� They shouted,
�Thyself thou art our king!� So I stood there
Smiling . . .

And buoyant and rejoicing was the spirit
With which I looked out how to end my days;
I felt once more myself my powers were mine;
I found that youth or health so lifted me,
That, spite of all life�s vanity, no grief
Came nigh me I must ever be light-hearted;
And that this feeling was the only veil
Betwixt me and despair: so if age came,
I should be as a wreck linked to a soul
Yet fluttering, or mind-broken, and aware
Of my decay. So a long summer morn
Found me; and e�er noon came, I had resolved
No age should come on me, ere youth�s hopes went,
For I would wear myself out like that morn
Which wasted not a sunbeam every joy
I would make mine, and die; and thus I sought
To chain my spirit down, which I had fed
With thoughts of fame. I said, the troubled life
Of genius seen so bright when working forth
Some trusted end, seems sad, when all in vain 
Most sad, when men have parted with all joy
For their wild fancy�s sake, which waited first,
As an obedient spirit, when delight
Came not with her alone, but alters soon,
Coming darkened, seldom, hasting to depart,
Leaving a heavy darkness and warm tears.

But I shall never lose her; she will live
Brighter for such seclusion I but catch
A hue, a glance of what I sing; so pain
Is linked with pleasure, for I ne�er may tell
The radiant sights which dazzle me; but now
They shall be all my own, and let them fade
Untold others shall rise as fair, as fast.
And when all�s done, the few dim gleams transferred, 
(For a new thought sprung up that it were well
To leave all shadowy hopes, and weave such lays
As would encircle me with praise and love;
So I should not die utterly I should bring
One branch from the gold forest, like the night
Of old tales, witnessing I had been there,) 
And when all�s done, how vain seems e�en success,
And all the influence poets have o�er men!
�Tis a fine thing that one, weak as myself,
Should sit in his lone room, knowing the words
He utters in his solitude shall move
Men like a swift wind that tho� he be forgotten,
Fair eyes shall glisten when his beauteous dreams
Of love come true in happier frames than his.
Ay, the still night brought thoughts like these, but morn
Came, and the mockery again laughed out
At hollow praises, and smiles, almost sneers;
And my soul�s idol seemed to whisper me

To dwell with him and his unhonoured name 
And I well knew my spirit, that would be
First in the struggle, and again would make
All bow to it; and I would sink again.

. . . . .

And then know that this curse will come on us,
To see our idols perish we may wither,
Nor marvel we are clay; but our low fate
Should not extend them, whom trustingly,
We sent before into Time�s yawning gulf,
To face what e�er may lurk in darkness there 
To see the painter�s glory pass, and feel
Sweet music move us not as once, or worst,
To see decaying wits ere the frail body
Decays. Nought makes me trust in love so really,
As the delight of the contented lowness
With which I gaze on souls I�d keep for ever
In beauty I�d be sad to equal them;
I�d feed their fame e�en from my heart�s best blood,
Withering unseen, that they might flourish still.

. . . . .

Pauline, my sweet friend, thou dost not forget
How this mood swayed me, when thou first wert mine,
When I had set myself to live this life,
Defying all opinion. Ere thou camest
I was most happy, sweet, for old delights
Had come like birds again; music, my life,
I nourished more than ever, and old lore
Loved for itself, and all it shows the king
Treading the purple calmly to his death,
While round him, like the clouds of eve, all dusk,
The giant shades of fate, silently flitting,
Pile the dim outline of the coming doom,
And him sitting alone in blood, while friends
Are hunting far in the sunshine; and the boy,
With his white breast and brow and clustering curls
Streaked with his mother�s blood, and striving hard
To tell his story ere his reason goes,
And when I loved thee, as I�ve loved so oft,
Thou lovedst me, and I wondered, and looked in
My heart to find some feeling like such love,
Believing I was still what I had been;
And soon I found all faith had gone from me,
And the late glow of life changing like clouds,
�Twas not the morn-blush widening into day,
But evening, coloured by the dying sun
While darkness is quick hastening: I will tell
Sly state as though �twere none of mine despair
Cannot come near me thus it is with me.
Souls alter not, and mine must progress still;
And this I knew not when I flung away
My youth�s chief aims. I ne�er supposed the
Of what few I retained; for no resource
Awaits me now behold the change of all.
I cannot chain my soul, it will not rest
In its clay prison; this most narrow sphere 
It has strange powers, and feelings, and desires,
Which I cannot account for, nor explain,
But which I stifle not, being bound to trust
All feelings equally to hear all sides:
Yet I cannot indulge them, and they live,
Referring to some state or life unknown. . . .

My selfishness is satiated not,
It wears me like a flame; my hunger for
All pleasure, howsoe�er minute, is pain;
I envy how I envy him whose mind
Turns with its energies to some one end!
To elevate a sect, or a pursuit,
However mean so my still baffled hopes
Seek out abstractions; I would have but one
Delight on earth, so it were wholly mine;
One rapture all my soul could fill and this
Wild feeling places me in dream afar,
In some wide country, where the eye can see
No end to the far hills and dales bestrewn
With shining towers and dwellings. I grow mad
Well-nigh, to know not one abode but holds
Some pleasure for my soul could grasp them all,
But must remain with this vile form. I look
With hope to age at last, which quenching much,
May let me concentrate the sparks it spares.

This restlessness of passion meets in me
A craving after knowledge: the sole proof
Of a commanding will is in that power
Repressed; for I beheld it in its dawn,
That sleepless harpy, with its budding wings,
And I considered whether I should yield
All hopes and fears, to live alone with it,
Finding a recompense in its wild eyes;
And when I found that I should perish so,
I bade its wild eyes close from me for ever; 
And I am left alone with my delights, 
So it lies in me a chained thing still ready
To serve me, if I loose its slightest bond 
I cannot but be proud of my bright slave.

And thus I know this earth is not my sphere,
For I cannot so narrow me, but that
I still exceed it; in their elements
My love would pass my reason but since here
Love must receive its object from this earth,
While reason will be chainless, the few truths
Caught from its wanderings have sufficed to quell
All love below; then what must be that love
Which, with the object it demands, would quell
Reason, tho� it soared with the seraphim?
No what I feel may pass all human love,
Yet fall far short of what my love should be;
And yet I seem more warped in this than aught
For here myself stands out more hideously.
I can forget myself in friendship, fame,
Or liberty, or love of mighty souls.

. . . . .

But I begin to know what thing hate is 
To sicken, and to quiver, and grow white,
And I myself have furnished its first prey.
All my sad weaknesses, this wavering will,
This selfishness, this still decaying frame . . .
But I must never grieve while I can pass
Far from such thoughts as now Andromeda!
And she is with me years roll, I shall change,
But change can touch her not so beautiful
With her dark eyes, earnest and still, and hair
Lifted and spread by the salt-sweeping breeze;
And one red-beam, all the storm leaves in heaven,
Resting upon her eyes and face and hair,
As she awaits the snake on the wet beach,
By the dark rock, and the white wave just breaking
At her feet; quite naked and alone, a thing
You doubt not, nor fear for, secure that God
Will come in thunder from the stars to save her.
Let it pass I will call another change.
I will be gifted with a wond�rous soul,
Yet sunk by error to men�s sympathy,
And in the wane of life; yet only so
As to call up their fears, and there shall come
A time requiring youth�s best energies;
And straight I fling age, sorrow, sickness off,
And I rise triumphing over my decay.

. . . . .

And thus it is that I supply the chasm
�Twixt what I am and all that I would be.
But then to know nothing to hope for nothing 
To seize on life�s dull joys from a strange tear,
Lest, being them, all�s lost, and nought remains

. . . . .

There�s some vile juggle with my reason here 
I feel I but explain to my own loss
These impulses they live no less the same.
Liberty! what though I despair my blood
Rose not at a slave�s name proudlier than now,
And sympathy obscured by sophistries.
Why have not I sought refuge in myself,
But for the woes I saw and could not stay 
And love! do I not love thee, my Pauline?

. . . . .

I cherish prejudice, lest I be left
Utterly loveless witness this belief
In poets, tho� sad change has come there too;
No more I leave myself to follow them:
Unconsciously I measure me by them.
Let me forget it; and I cherish most
My love of England how her name a word
Of her�s in a strange tongue makes my heart beat! . . .

. . . . .

Pauline, I could do any thing not now 
All�s fever but when calm shall come again 
I am prepared I have made life my own 
I would not be content with all the change
One frame should feel but I have gone in thought
Thro� all conjuncture I have lived all life
When it is most alive where strangest fate
New shapes it past surmise the tales of men
Bit by some curse or in the grasp of doom
Half-visible and still increasing round,
Or crowning their wide being�s general aim. . . .

. . . . .

These are wild fancies, but I feel, sweet friend,
As one breathing his weakness to the ear
Of pitying angel dear as a winter flower.
A slight flower growing alone, and offering
Its frail cup of three leaves to the cold sun,
Yet and confiding, like the triumph
Of a child and why am I not worthy thee?

. . . . .

I can live all the life of plants, and gaze
Drowsily on the bees that flit and play,
Or bare my breast for sunbeams which will kill,
Or open in the night of sounds, to look
For the dim stars; I can mount with the bird,
Leaping airily his pyramid of leaves
And twisted boughs of some tall mountain tree,
Or rise cheerfully springing to the heavens 
Or like a fish breathe in the morning air
In the misty sun-warm water or with flowers
And trees can smile in light at the sinking sun,
Just as the storm comes as a girl would look
On a departing lover most serene.

Pauline, come with me see how I could build
A home for us, out of the world; in thought 
I am inspired come with me, Pauline!

Night, and one single ridge of narrow path
Between the sullen river and the woods
Waving and muttering for the moonless night
Has shaped them into images of life,
Like the upraising of the giant-ghosts,
Looking on earth to know how their sons fare.
Thou art so close by me, the roughest swell
Of wind in the tree-tops hides not the panting
Of thy soft breasts; no we will pass to morning 
Morning the rocks, and vallies, and old woods.
How the sun brightens in the mist, and here, 
Half in the air, like creatures of the place,
Trusting the element living on high boughs
That swing in the wind look at the golden spray,
Flung from the foam-sheet of the cataract,
Amid the broken rocks shall we stay here
With the wild hawks? no, ere the hot noon come
Dive we down safe; see this our new retreat
Walled in with a sloped mound of matted shrubs,
Dark, tangled, old and green still sloping down
To a small pool whose waters lie asleep
Amid the trailing boughs turned water plants
And tall trees over-arch to keep us in,
Breaking the sunbeams into emerald shafts,
And in the dreamy water one small group
Of two or three strange trees are got together,
Wondering at all around as strange beasts herd
Together far from their own land all wildness 
No turf nor moss, for boughs and plants pave all,
And tongues of bank go shelving in the waters,
Where the pale-throated snake reclines his head,
And old grey stones lie making eddies there;
The wild mice cross them dry-shod deeper in 
Shut thy soft eyes now look still deeper in:
This is the very heart of the woods all round,
Mountain-like, heaped above us; yet even here
One pond of water gleams far off the river
Sweeps like a sea, barred out from land; but one 
One thin clear sheet has over-leaped and wound
Into this silent depth, which gained, it lies
Still, as but let by sufferance; the trees bend
O�er it as wild men watch a sleeping girl,
And thro� their roots long creeping plants stretch out
Their twined hair, steeped and sparkling; farther on,
Tall rushes and thick flag-knots have combined
To narrow it; so, at length, a silver thread
It winds, all noiselessly, thro� the deep wood,
Till thro� a cleft way, thro� the moss and stone,
It joins its parent-river with a shout.
Up for the glowing day leave the old woods:
See, they part, like a ruined arch, the sky!
Nothing but sky appears, so close the root
And grass of the hill-top level with the air 
Blue sunny air, where a great cloud floats, laden
With light, like a dead whale that white birds pick,
Floating away in the sun in some north sea.
Air, air fresh life-blood thin and searching air 
The clear, dear breath of God, that loveth us:
Where small birds reel and winds take their delight.
Water is beautiful, but not like air.
See, where the solid azure waters lie,
Made as of thickened air, and down below,
The fern-ranks, like a forest spread themselves,
As tho� each pore could feel the element;
Where the quick glancing serpent winds his way 
Float with me there, Pauline, but not like air.
Down the hill stop a clump of trees, see, set
On a heap of rocks, which look o�er the far plains,
And envious climbing shrubs would mount to rest,
And peer from their spread boughs. There they wave, looking
At the muleteers, who whistle as they go
To the merry chime of their morning bells and all
The little smoking cots, and fields, and banks,
And copses, bright in the sun; my spirit wanders.
Hedge-rows for me still, living, hedge-rows, where
The bushes close, and clasp above, and keep
Thought in I am concentrated I feel; 
But my soul saddens when it looks beyond;
I cannot be immortal, nor taste all.
O God! where does this tend these straggling aims!1

What would I have? what is this �sleep,� which seems
To bound all? can there be a �waking� point
Of crowning life? The soul would never rule 
It would be first in all things it would have
Its utmost pleasure filled but that complete
Commanding for commanding sickens it.
The last point that I can trace is, rest beneath
Some better essence than itself in weakness;
This is �myself� not what I think should be,
And what is that I hunger for but God?
My God, my God! let me for once look on thee
As tho� nought else existed: we alone.
And as creation crumbles, my soul�s spark
Expands till I can say, �Even from myself
�I need thee, and I feel thee, and I love thee;
�I do not plead my rapture in thy works
�For love of thee or that I feel as one
�Who cannot die but there is that in me
�Which turns to thee, which loves, or which should love.�

Why have I girt myself with this hell-dress?
Why have I laboured to put out my life?
Is it not in my nature to adore,
And e�en for all my reason do I not
Feel him, and thank him, and pray to him? Now.
Can I forego the trust that he loves me?
Do I not feel a love which only ONE . . .
O thou pale form, so dimly seen, deep-eyed,
I have denied thee calmly do I not
Pant when I read of thy consummate deeds,
And burn to see thy calm pure truths out-flash
The brightest gleams of earth�s philosophy?
Do I not shake to hear aught question thee? . . .

If I am erring save me, madden me,
Take from me powers, and pleasures let me die
Ages, so I see thee: I am knit round
As with a charm, by sin and lust and pride,
Yet tho� my wandering dreams have seen all shapes
Of strange delight, oft have I stood by thee 
Have I been keeping lonely watch with thee,
In the damp night by weeping Olivet,
Or leaning on thy bosom, proudly less 
Or dying with thee on the lonely cross 
Or witnessing thy bursting from the tomb!

A mortal, sin�s familiar friend doth here
Avow that he will give all earth�s reward,
But to believe and humbly teach the faith,
In suffering, and poverty, and shame,
Only believing he is not unloved. . . .

And now, my Pauline, I am thine for ever!
I feel the spirit which has buoyed me up
Deserting me: and old shades gathering on;
Yet while its last light waits, I would say much,
And chiefly, I am glad that I have said
That love which I have ever felt for thee,
But seldom told; our hearts so beat together,
That speech is mockery, but when dark hours come:
And I feel sad; and thou, sweet, deem�st it strange;
A sorrow moves me, thou canst not remove.
Look on this lay I dedicate to thee,
Which thro� thee I began, and which I end,
Collecting the last gleams to strive to tell
That I am thine, and more than ever now 
That I am sinking fast yet tho� I sink
No less I feel that thou hast brought me bliss,
And that I still may hope to win it back.
Thou know�st, dear friend, I could not think all calm,
For wild dreams followed me, and bore me off,
And all was indistinct. Ere one was caught
Another glanced: so dazzled by my wealth,
Knowing not which to leave nor which to choose,
For all my thoughts so floated, nought was fixed 
And then thou said�st a perfect bard was one
Who shadowed out the stages of all life,
And so thou badest me tell this my first stage: 
�Tis done: and even now I feel all dim the shift
Of thought. These are my last thoughts; I discern
Faintly immortal life, and truth, and good.
And why thou must be mine is, that e�en now,
In the dim hush of night that I have done 
With fears and sad forebodings: I look thro�

And say, �E�en at the last I have her still,
�With her delicious eyes as clear as heaven,
�When rain in a quick shower has beat down mist,
�And clouds float white in the sun like broods of swans.�
How the blood lies upon her cheek, all spread
As thinned by kisses; only in her lips
It wells and pulses like a living thing,
And her neck looks, like marble misted o�er
With love-breath, a dear thing to kiss and love,
Standing beneath me looking out to me,
As I might kill her and be loved for it.

Love me love me, Pauline, love nought but me;
Leave me not. All these words are wild and weak,
Believe them not, Pauline. I stooped so low
But to behold thee purer by my side,
To show thou art my breath my life a last
Resource an extreme want: never believe
Aught better could so look to thee, nor seek
Again the world of good thoughts left for me.
There were bright troops of undiscovered suns.
Each equal in their radiant course. There were
Clusters of far fair isles, which ocean kept
For his own joy, and his waves broke on them
Without a choice. And there was a dim crowd
Of visions, each a part of the dim whole.
And a star left his peers and came with peace
Upon a storm, and all eyes pined for him,
And one isle harboured a sea-beaten ship,
And the crew wandered in its bowers, and plucked
Its fruits, and gave up all their hopes for home.
And one dream came to a pale poet�s sleep,
And he said, �I am singled out by God,
�No sin must touch me.� I am very weak,
But what I would express is, Leave me not,
Still sit by me with beating breast, and hair
Loosened watching earnest by my side,
Turning my books, or kissing me when I
Look up like summer wind. Be still to me
A key to music�s mystery, when mind fails,
A reason, a solution and a clue,
You see I have thrown off my prescribed rules:
I hope in myself and hope, and pant, and love 
You�ll find me better know me more than when
You loved me as I was. Smile not; I have
Much yet to gladden you to dawn on you.

No more of the past I�ll look within no more 
I have too trusted to my own wild wants 
Too trusted to myself to intuition.
Draining the wine alone in the still night,
And seeing how as gathering films arose,
As by an inspiration life seemed bare
And grinning in its vanity, and ends
Hard to be dreamed of, stared at me as fixed,
And others suddenly became all foul,
As a fair witch turned an old hag at night.
No more of this we will go hand in hand,
I will go with thee, even as a child,
Looking no further than thy sweet commands.
And thou hast chosen where this life shall be 
The land which gave me thee shall be our home,
Where nature lies all wild amid her lakes
And snow-swathed mountains, and vast pines all girt
With ropes of snow where nature lies all bare,
Suffering none to view her but a race
Most stinted and deformed like the mute dwarfs
Which wait upon a naked Indian queen.
And there (the time being when the heavens are thick
With storms) I�ll sit with thee while thou dost sing
Thy native songs, gay as a desert bird
Who crieth as he flies for perfect joy,
Or telling me old stories of dead knights,
Or I will read old lays to thee how she,
The fair pale sister, went to her chill grave
With power to love, and to be loved, and live.
Or will go together, like twin gods
Of the infernal world, with scented lamp
Over the dead to call and to awake 
Over the unshaped images which lie
Within my mind�s cave only leaving all
That tells of the past doubts. So when spring comes,
And sunshine comes again like an old smile,
And the fresh waters, and awakened birds,
And budding woods await us I shall be
Prepared, and we will go and think again,
And all old loves shall come to us but changed
As some sweet thought which harsh words veiled before;
Feeling God loves us, and that all that errs,
Is a strange dream which death will dissipate;
And then when I am firm we�ll seek again
My own land, and again I will approach
My old designs, and calmly look on all
The works of my past weakness, as one views
Some scene where danger met him long before
Ah! that such pleasant life should be but dreamed!

But whate�er come of it and tho� it fade,
And tho� ere the cold morning all be gone
As it will be; tho� music wait for me,
And fair eyes and bright wine, laughing like sin,
Which steals back softly on a soul half saved;
And I be first to deny all, and despise
This verse, and these intents which seem so fair;
Still this is all my own, this moment�s pride,
No less I make an end in perfect joy.
E�en in my brightest time, a lurking fear
Possessed me. I well knew my weak resolves,
I felt the witchery that makes mind sleep
Over its treasures as one half afraid
To make his riches definite but now
These feelings shall not utterly be lost,
I shall not know again that nameless care,
Lest leaving all undone in youth, some new
And undreamed end reveal itself too late:
For this song shall remain to tell for ever,
That when I lost all hope of such a change
Suddenly Beauty rose on me again.
No less I make an end in perfect joy,
For I, having thus again been visited,
Shall doubt not many another bliss awaits,
And tho� this weak soul sink, and darkness come,
Some little word shall light it up again,
And I shall see all clearer and love better;
I shall again go o�er the tracts of thought,
As one who has a right; and I shall live
With poets calmer purer still each time,
And beauteous shapes will come to me again,
And unknown secrets will be trusted me,
Which were not mine when wavering but now
I shall be priest and lover, as of old.

Sun-treader, I believe in God, and truth,
And love; and as one just escaped from death
Would bind himself in bands of friends to feel
He lives indeed so, I would lean on thee;
Thou must be ever with me most in gloom
When such shall come but chiefly when I die,
For I seem dying, as one going in the dark
To fight a giant and live thou for ever,
And be to all what thou hast been to me 
All in whom this wakes pleasant thoughts of me,
Know my last state is happy free from doubt,
Or touch of fear. Love me and wish me well!
