She bewitched me in my childhood,
 And the witch's charm is hidden - 
Far beyond the wicked wildwood
 I shall find it, I am bidden.

She commands me, she who bound me
 With soft sorcery to follow;
In a golden snare who wound me
 To her bosom's snowy hollow....

Comes a night-dark stallion sired
 Of the wind; a mare his mother
Whom Thessalian madness fired,
 And the hurricane his brother.

Then my soul delays no longer:
 Though the night around is scowling,
Keenly mount him blacker, stronger
 Than the tempest that is howling.

At our ears wild shadows whistle;
 Brazen forks the lightning o'er us
Flames; and huge the thunder's missile
 Bursts behind us, drags before us.

Over fire-scorched fields of stubble;
 Iron forests dark with wonder;
Evil marshes black with trouble;
 Nightmare torrents thundering under:

In the thorn that past us races,
 Harelipped hags like crows are rocking;
Stunted oaks have dwarf-like faces
 Gnarled that leer an impish mocking:

Rocks, in which the storm is hooting,
 Thrust a humpbacked murder over;
Bristling heaths, dead thistles shooting,
 Raven-haunted gibbets cover:

Each and all are passed, like water
 Under-rolled into a cavern,
Till we see the Devil's daughter
 Waiting at the Devil's tavern.

And we stay; I drain the beaker
 In her hand; the draught is fire;
World-remembrances grow weaker,
 And my spirit, one desire.

Course it! course it! Darkness passes
 Like an uprolled banner tattered;
Walled before us mountain masses
 Rise like centuries unscattered.

And the storm flies ragged. Slowly
 Comes a moon of copper-color,
And the evil night grows holy,
 Mists the wild ride growing duller.

In the round moon's angry scanning,
 Demon-swift cross spider arches
Of the web-thick bridges spanning
 Chasms of her kingdom's marches.

We have reached her kingdom, olden
 As the sea that sighs its sadness;
Rocks and trees and sands are golden,
 And the air a golden gladness.

Shapely ingots are the flowers,
 And the waters, amber brightness;
Gold-bright, song-birds in the bowers
 Sing with eyes of diamond whiteness.

And she meets me with a chalice
 Like the Giamschid ruby burning,
And I drain it without malice,
 To her towers of topaz turning.

Many hundred years forgetting
 All that's earth: within her power
I possess her: naught regretting
 Since each year is as an hour.
