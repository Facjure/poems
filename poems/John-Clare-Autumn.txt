 Syren of sullen moods and fading hues,
 Yet haply not incapable of joy,
 Sweet Autumn! I thee hail
 With welcome all unfeigned;

 And oft as morning from her lattice peeps
 To beckon up the sun, I seek with thee
 To drink the dewy breath
 Of fields left fragrant then,

 In solitudes, where no frequented paths
 But what thine own foot makes betray thine home,
 Stealing obtrusive there
 To meditate thy end;

 By overshadowed ponds, in woody nooks,
 With ramping sallows lined, and crowding sedge,
 Which woo the winds to play,
 And with them dance for joy;

 And meadow pools, torn wide by lawless floods,
 Where waterlilies spread their oily leaves,
 On which, as wont, the fly
 Oft battens in the sun;

 Where leans the mossy willow half way o'er,
 On which the shepherd crawls astride to throw
 His angle, clear of weeds
 That crown the water's brim;

 Or crispy hills and hollows scant of sward,
 Where step by step the patient, lonely boy,
 Hath cut rude flights of stairs
 To climb their steepy sides;

 * * * * *

 Now filtering winds thin winnow through the woods
 With tremulous noise, that bids, at every breath,
 Some sickly cankered leaf
 Let go its hold and die.

 And now the bickering storm, with sudden start,
 In flirting fits of anger carps aloud,
 Thee urging to thine end,
 Sore wept by troubled skies.

 And yet, sublime in grief, thy thoughts delight
 To show me visions of most gorgeous dyes,
 Haply forgetting now
 They but prepare thy shroud;

 Thy pencil dashing its excess of shades,
 Improvident of wealth, till every bough
 Burns with thy mellow touch
 Disorderly divine.

 Soon must I view thee as a pleasant dream
 Droop faintly, and so reckon for thine end,
 As sad the winds sink low
 In dirges for their queen;

 While in the moment of their weary pause,
 To cheer thy bankrupt pomp, the willing lark
 Starts from his shielding clod,
 Snatching sweet scraps of song.

 Thy life is waning now, and Silence tries
 To mourn, but meets no sympathy in sounds,
 As stooping low she bends,
 Forming with leaves thy grave;

 To sleep inglorious there mid tangled woods,
 Till parch-lipped Summer pines in drought away;
 Then from thine ivied trance
 Awake to glories new.
