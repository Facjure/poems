 (Min River, Fo Kien.)


 Up in the misty morning,
Up past the gardened hills,
 With the rhythmic stroke of the rowers,
While the blue deep pales and thrills!

 Past the rice-fields green low-lying,
Where the sea-gull's winging down
 From the fleets of junks and sampans
And the ancient Chinese Town!
