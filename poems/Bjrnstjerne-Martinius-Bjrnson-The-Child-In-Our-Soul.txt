title: The Child In Our Soul
---

 Toward God in heaven spacious
With artless faith a boy looks free,
 As toward his mother gracious,
And top of Christmas-tree.
But early in the storm of youth
There wounds him deep the serpent's tooth;
 His childhood's faith is doubted
 And flouted.

 Soon stands in radiant splendor
With bridal wreath his boyhood's dream;
 Her loving eyes and tender
The light of heaven's faith stream.
As by his mother's knee of yore
God's name he stammers yet once more,
 The rue of tears now paying
 And praying.

 When now life's conflict stirring
Leads him along through doubtings wild,
 Then upward points unerring
Close by his side his child.
With children he a child is still
And whatsoe'er his heart may chill,
 Prayer for his son is warming,
 Transforming.

 The greatest man in wonder
Must ward the child within his breast,
 And list 'mid loudest thunder
Its whisperings unrepressed.
Where oft a hero fell with shame,
The child it was restored his name,
 His better self revealing,
 And healing.

 All great things thought created
In child-like joy sprang forth and grew;
 All strength with goodness mated,
Obeyed the child's voice true.
When beauty in the soul held sway,
The child gave it in artless play; - 
 All wisdom worldly-minded
 Is blinded.

 Hail him, who forward presses
So far that he a home is worth
 For there alone possesses
The child-life peace on earth.
Though worn we grieve and hardened grow,
What solace 't is our home to know
 With children's laughter ringing
 And singing.
