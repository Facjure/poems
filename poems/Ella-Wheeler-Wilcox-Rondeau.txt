As you forgot I may forget,
When summer dews cease to be wet.
 When whippoorwills disdain the night,
 When sun and moon are no more bright,
And all the stars at midnight set.

When jay birds sing, and thrushes fret,
When snowfalls come in flakes of jet,
 When hearts that shelter love are light,
I may forget.

When mortal life no cares beset,
When April brings no violet,
 When wrong no longer wars with right,
 When all hope's ships shall heave in sight,
And memory holds no least regret,
I may forget.
