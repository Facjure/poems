title: Spirit Of A Great Control
---

Spirit of a Great Control,
 Gird me with thy strength and might,
Essence of the Over-Soul -
 Fill me, thrill me with thy light;
Though the waves of sorrow beat
 Madly at my very feet,
Though the night and storm are near,
 Teach me that I need not fear.

Though the clouds obscure the sky,
 When the tempest sweeps the lands,
Still about, below, on high,
 God's great solar system stands.
Never yet a star went out.
 What have I to fear or doubt? -
I, a part of this great whole,
 Governed by the Over-Soul.

Like the great eternal hills,
 Like the rock that fronts the wave,
Let me meet all earthly ills
 With a fearless heart and brave;
Like the earth that drinks the rain,
 Let me welcome floods of pain,
Till I grow in strength to be
 Worthy of my source in Thee.
