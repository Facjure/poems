I cried, 'Dear Angel, lead me to the heights,
 And spur me to the top.'
 The Angel answered, 'Stop
And set thy house in order; make it fair
For absent ones who may be speeding there.
 Then will we talk of heights.'

I put my house in order.'Now lead on!'
 The Angel said, 'Not yet;
 Thy garden is beset
By thorns and tares; go weed it, so all those
Who come to gaze may find the unvexed rose;
 Then will we journey on.'

I weeded well my garden.'All is done.'
 The Angel shook his head.
 'A beggar stands,' he said,
'Outside thy gates; till thou hast given heed
And soothed his sorrow, and supplied his need,
 Say not that all is done.'

The beggar left me singing.'Now at last - 
 At last the path is clear.'
 'Nay, there is one draws near
Who seeks, like thee, the difficult highway.
He lacks thy courage; cheer him through the day
 Then will we cry, "At last!"'

I helped my weaker brother.'Now the heights;
 Oh, Guide me, Angel, guide!'
 The Presence at my side,
With radiant face, said, 'Look, where are we now?'
And lo! we stood upon the mountain's brow - 
 The heights, the shining heights!
