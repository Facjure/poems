Here comes Kate Summers, who, for gold,
 Takes any man to bed:
"You knew my friend, Nell Barnes," she said;
 "You knew Nell Barnes - she's dead.

"Nell Barnes was bad on all you men,
 Unclean, a thief as well;
Yet all my life I have not found
 A better friend than Nell.

"So I sat at her side at last,
 For hours, till she was dead;
And yet she had no sense at all
 Of any word I said.

"For all her cry but came to this -
 'Not for the world! Take care:
Don't touch that bird of paradise,
 Perched on the bed-post there!'

"I asked her would she like some grapes,
 Some damsons ripe and sweet;
A custard made with new-laid eggs,
 Or tender fowl to eat.

"I promised I would follow her,
 To see her in her grave;
And buy a wreath with borrowed pence,
 If nothing I could save.

"Yet still her cry but came to this -
 'Not for the world! Take care:
Don't touch that bird of paradise,
 Perched on the bed-post there!'"
