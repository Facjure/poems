�Man is blind because of sin;
�Revelation makes him sure.
�Without that, who looks within,
�Looks in vain, for all�s obscure.�

Nay, look closer into man!
Tell me, can you find indeed
Nothing sure, no moral plan
Clear prescribed, without your creed?

�No, I nothing can perceive;
�Without that, all�s dark for men.
�That, or nothing, I believe.�
For God�s sake, believe it then!
