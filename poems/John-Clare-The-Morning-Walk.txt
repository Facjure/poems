title: The Morning Walk

 The linnet sat upon its nest,
 By gales of morning softly prest,
 His green wing and his greener breast
 Were damp with dews of morning:
 The dog-rose near the oaktree grew,
 Blush'd swelling 'neath a veil of dew,
 A pink's nest to its prickles grew,
 Right early in the morning.

 The sunshine glittered gold, the while
 A country maiden clomb the stile;
 Her straw hat couldn't hide the smile
 That blushed like early morning.
 The lark, with feathers all wet through,
 Looked up above the glassy dew,
 And to the neighbouring corn-field flew,
 Fanning the gales of morning.

 In every bush was heard a song,
 On each grass blade, the whole way long,
 A silver shining drop there hung,
 The milky dew of morning.
 Where stepping-stones stride o'er the brook
 The rosy maid I overtook.
 How ruddy was her healthy look,
 So early in the morning!

 I took her by the well-turned arm,
 And led her over field and farm,
 And kissed her tender cheek so warm,
 A rose in early morning.
 The spiders' lacework shone like glass,
 Tied up to flowers and cat-tail grass;
 The dew-drops bounced before the lass,
 Sprinkling the early morning.

 Her dark curls fanned among the gales,
 The skylark whistled o'er the vales,
 I told her love's delightful tales
 Among the dews of morning.
 She crop't a flower, shook oft' the dew,
 And on her breast the wild rose grew;
 She blushed as fair, as lovely, too--
 The living rose of morning.
