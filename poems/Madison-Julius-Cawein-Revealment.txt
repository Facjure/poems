 At moonset when ghost speaks with ghost,
 And spirits meet where once they sinned,
 Between the bournes of found and lost,
 My soul met her soul on the wind,
 My late-lost Evalind.

 I kissed her mouth. Her face was wild.
 Two burning shadows were her eyes,
 Wherefrom the maiden love, that smiled
 A heartbreak smile of severed ties,
 Gazed with a wan surprise.

 Then suddenly I seemed to see
 No more her shape where beauty bloomed ...
 My own sad self gazed up at me
 My sorrow, that had so assumed
 The form of her entombed.
