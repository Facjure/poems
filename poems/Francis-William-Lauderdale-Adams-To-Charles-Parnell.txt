 One thing we praise you for that is past praise - 
The dauntless eyes that faced the rain and night,
The hand that never wearied in the fight,
 Till, through the dark's despair, the dawn's delays,
 It rose, that vision of forgotten days,
Ireland, a nation in her right and might,
As fearless of the lightning as the Light, - 
 Freedom, the noon-tide sun that shines and stays!
 O brave, O pure, O hater of the wrong,
(The wrong that is as one with England's name,
Tyranny with cant of liberty, and shame
 With boast of righteousness), to you belong
Trust for the hate that blinds our foes like flame,
 Love for the hope that makes our hearts so strong!
