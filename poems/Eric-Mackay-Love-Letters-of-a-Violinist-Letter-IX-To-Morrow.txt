Letter IX. To-Morrow.


I.

O Love! O Love! O Gateway of Delight!
 Thou porch of peace, thou pageant of the prime
 Of all God's creatures! I am here to climb
Thine upward steps, and daily and by night
To gaze beyond them, and to search aright
 The far-off splendour of thy track sublime.


II.

For, in thy precincts, on the further side,
 Beyond the turret where the bells are rung,
 Beyond the chapel where the rites are sung,
There is a garden fit for any bride.
O Love! by thee, by thee are sanctified
 The joys thereof to keep our spirits young.


III.

By thee, dear Love! by thee, if all be well -
 And we be wise enough to own the touch
 Of some bright folly that has thrill'd us much -
By thee, till death, we may regain the spell
Of wizard Merlin, and in every dell
 Confront a Muse, and bow to it as such.


IV.

Love! Happy Love! Behold me where I stand
 This side thy portal, with my straining eyes
 Turn'd to the Future. Cloudless are the skies,
And, far adown the road which thou hast spann'd,
I see the groves of that elected land
 Which is the place I call my paradise.


V.

But what is this? The plains are known to me;
 The hills are known, the fields, the little fence,
 The noisy brook as clear as innocence,
And this old oak, the wonder of the lea,
Which stops the wind to know if there shall be
 Sorrow for men, or pride, or recompense.


VI.

I know these things, yet hold it little blame
 To know them not, though in their proud array,
 The flowers advance to make the world so gay.
Ah, what a change! The things I know by name
Look unfamiliar all, and, like a flame,
 The roses burn upon the hedge to-day.


VII.

The grass is velvet. There are pearls thereon,
 And golden signs, and braid that doth appear
 Made for a bridal. This is fairy gear
If I mistake not. I shall know anon.
Nature herself will teach me how to con
 The new-found words to thank the glowing year.


VIII.

This is the path that led me to the brook;
 And this the mead, and this the mossy slope,
 And this the place where breezes did elope
With giddy moths, enamour'd of a look;
And here I sat alone, or with a book,
 Dreaming the dreams of constancy and hope.


IX.

I loved the river well; but not till now
 Did I perceive the marvels of the shore.
 This is a cave, and this an emerald floor;
And here Sir Englantine might make a vow,
And here a king, a guilty king, might bow
 Before a child, and break his word no more.


X.

The day is dying. I shall see him die,
 And I shall watch the sunset, and the red
 Of all that splendour when the day is dead.
And I shall see the stars upon the sky,
And think them torches that are lit on high
 To light the Lord Apollo to his bed.


XI.

And sweet To-morrow, like a golden bark,
 Will call for me, and lead me on apace
 To where I shall behold, in all her grace,
Mine own true Lady, whom a happy lark
Did late salute, appointing, after dark,
 A nightingale to carol in his place.


XII.

Oh, come to me! Oh, come, belovï¿½d day,
 O sweet To-morrow! Youngest of the sons
 Of old King Time, to whom Creation runs
As men to God. Oh, quickly with thy ray
Anoint my head, and teach me how to pray,
 As gentle Jesus taught the little ones.


XIII.

I am aweary of the waiting hours,
 I am aweary of the tardy night.
 The hungry moments rob me of delight,
The crawling minutes steal away my powers;
And I am sick at heart, as one who cowers,
 In lonely haunts, remov'd from human sight.


XIV.

How shall I think the night was meant for sleep,
 When I must count the dreadful hours thereof,
 And cannot beat them down, or bid them doff
Their hateful masks? A man may wake and weep
From hour to hour, and, in the silence deep,
 See shadows move, and almost hear them scoff.


XV.

Oh, come to me, To-morrow! like a friend,
 And not as one who bideth for the clock.
 Be swift to come, and I will hear thee knock,
And though the night refuse to make an end
Of her dull peace, I promptly will descend
 And let thee in, and thank thee for the shock.


XVI.

Dear, good To-morrow! in my life, till now,
 I did not think to need thee quite so soon.
 I did not think that I should hate the moon,
Or new or old, or that my fevered brow
Requir'd the sun to cool it. I will bow
 To this new day, that he may grant the boon.


XVII.

Yes, 'twill consent. The day will dawn at last.
 Day and the tide approach. They cannot rest.
 They must approach. They must by every test
Of all men's knowledge, neither slow nor fast,
Approach and front us. When the night is past,
 The morrow's dawn will lead me to my quest.


XVIII.

Then shall I tremble greatly, and be glad,
 For I shall meet my true-love all alone,
 And none shall tell me of her dainty zone,
And none shall say how sweetly she is clad;
But I shall know it. Men may call me mad;
 But I shall know how bright the world has grown.


XIX.

There is a grammar of the lips and eyes,
 And I have learnt it. There are tokens sure
 Of trust in love; and I have found them pure.
Is love the guerdon then? Is love the prize?
It is! It is! We find it in the skies,
 And here on earth 'tis all that will endure.


XX.

All things for love. All things in some divine
 And wish'd for way, conspire, as Nature knows,
 To some great good. Where'er a daisy grows
There grows a joy. The forest-trees combine
To talk of peace when mortals would repine;
 And he is false to God who flouts the rose.
