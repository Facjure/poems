 Destruction of the Ram Albermarle by the Torpedo-Launch.
 (October, 1864.)


 Palely intent, he urged his keel
 Full on the guns, and touched the spring;
 Himself involved in the bolt he drove
 Timed with the armed hull's shot that stove
 His shallop - die or do!
 Into the flood his life he threw,
 Yet lives - unscathed - a breathing thing
 To marvel at.

 He has his fame;
 But that mad dash at death, how name?

 Had Earth no charm to stay the Boy
 From the martyr-passion? Could he dare
 Disdain the Paradise of opening joy
 Which beckons the fresh heart every where?
 Life has more lures than any girl
 For youth and strength; puts forth a share
 Of beauty, hinting of yet rarer store;
 And ever with unfathomable eyes,
 Which baffingly entice,
 Still strangely does Adonis draw.
 And life once over, who shall tell the rest?
 Life is, of all we know, God's best.
 What imps these eagles then, that they
 Fling disrespect on life by that proud way
 In which they soar above our lower clay.

 Pretense of wonderment and doubt unblest:
 In Cushing's eager deed was shown
 A spirit which brave poets own - 
 That scorn of life which earns life's crown;
 Earns, but not always wins; but he - 
 The star ascended in his nativity.
