 So easy 'tis to make a rhyme,
 That did the world but know it,
 Your coachman might Parnassus climb,
 Your butler be a poet.

 Then, oh, how charming it would be
 If, when in haste hysteric
 You called the page, you learned that he
 Was grappling with a lyric.

 Or else what rapture it would yield,
 When cook sent up the salad,
 To find within its depths concealed
 A touching little ballad.

 Or if for tea and toast you yearned,
 What joy to find upon it
 The chambermaid had coyly laid
 A palpitating sonnet.

 Your baker could the fashion set;
 Your butcher might respond well;
 With every tart a triolet,
 With every chop a rondel.

 Your tailor's bill . . . well, I'll be blowed!
 Dear chap! I never knowed him . . .
 He's gone and written me an ode,
 Instead of what I owed him.

 So easy 'tis to rhyme . . . yet stay!
 Oh, terrible misgiving!
 Please do not give the game away . . .
 I've got to make my living.
