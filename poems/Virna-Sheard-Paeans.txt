Oh! I will hold fast to Joy!
 I will not let him depart - 
He shall close his beautiful rainbow wings
 And sing his song in my heart.

And I will live with Delight!
 I will know what the children know
When they dance along with the April wind
 To find where the catkins grow!

I will dream the old, old dreams,
 And look for pixie and fay
In shadowy woods - and out on the hills - 
 As we did but yesterday.

Love I will keep in my soul - 
 Ay! even by lock and key!
There is nothing to fear in all of the world
 If Love will but stay with me.

No, I will not let Faith go!
 I will say with my latest breath - 
I know there's a new and radiant road
 On the other side of Death.
