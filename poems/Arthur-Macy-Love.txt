[TRIO]


 Oh, love hits all humanity, humanity, my dear;
 But after all it's vanity, a vanity, I fear;
 And sometimes 'tis insanity, insanity, so queer;
Humanity, yes, a vanity, yes, insanity so queer.
 And love is often curious, so curious to see,
 And oftentimes is spurious, so spurious, ah, me!
 And surely 'tis injurious, injurious when free,
So curious, yes, and spurious, yes, injurious when free.

 Oh, love brings much anxiety, anxiety and grief,
 But seasoned with propriety, propriety, relief,
 It's mixed with joy and piety, but piety is brief;
Anxiety, yes, propriety, yes, but piety is brief.
 Oh, young love's all timidity, timidity, I'm told,
 Gains courage with rapidity, rapidity, so bold,
 With traces of acidity, acidity, when old;
Timidity, yes, rapidity, yes, acidity, when old.
