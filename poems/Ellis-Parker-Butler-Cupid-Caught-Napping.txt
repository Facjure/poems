title: Cupid Caught Napping
---

Cupid on a summer day,
Wearied by unceasing play,
In a rose heart sleeping lay,
While, to guard the tricksy fellow,
Close above the fragrant bed
Back and forth a gruff bee sped,
And, to lull the sleepy head,
Played �Zoom! Zoom!� upon his �cello.

Little did the god surmise
That sweet Anna�s cerule eyes
Gazed on him with glad surprise,
Or that he was in such danger;
But the watchman bee, in haste,
Left his post that he might taste
of the honey nature placed
On the lips of that fair stranger.

Thus unwatched, from Cupid�s side
Anna stole the boy god�s pride,
All his love darts, and then hied
Far away from capture�s chances
And today she wields the prize;
For Love�s quiver still supplies
Darts that speed from Anna�s eyes
In her love compelling glances!
