title: The Fog
---

Out of the lamp-bestarred and clouded dusk - 
Snaring, illuding, concealing,
Magically conjuring - 
Turning to fairy-coaches
Beetle-backed limousines
Scampering under the great Arch - 
Making a decoy of blue overalls
And mystery of a scarlet shawl - 
Indolently - 
Knowing no impediment of its sure advance - 
Descends the fog.
