title: In The Heart Of June
---

 In the heart of June, love,
You and I together,
 On from dawn till noon, love,
Laughing with the weather;
 Blending both our souls, love,
In the selfsame tune,
 Drinking all life holds, love,
In the heart of June.

 In the heart of June, love,
With its golden weather,
 Underneath the moon, love,
You and I together.
 Ah! how sweet to seem, love,
Drugged and half aswoon
 With this luscious dream, love,
In the heart of June.
