A toast to thee, 0 dear old year,
 While the last moments fly,
A toast to thy sweet memory - 
 We'll lift the glasses high,
And bid to thee a fond farewell
 As thou art passing by!

A toast to those who reaped success
 In this good year of grace;
A toast to every one of them - 
 Come! Give the victors place!
Come, wish them well with right good will - 
 The winners in the race!

And one toast more! To those who failed
 Wherever they may be; - 
With faces white they fought the fight,
 But missed the victory;
So here's to them - the ones who strove - 
 On land and on the sea!

Fair dreams to thee, 0 grey old year,
 Thy working time is done,
And gone for thee the silver moon,
 And golden noon-day sun;
Yet sad old year - and glad old year - 
 We'll know no better one.
