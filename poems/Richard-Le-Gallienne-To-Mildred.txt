 Always thy book, too late acknowledged thine,
 Now when thine eyes no earthly page may read;
 Blinded with death, or blinded with the shine
 Of love's own lore celestial. Small need,
 Forsooth, for thee to read my earthly line,
 That on immortal flowers of fancy feed;
 What should my angel do to stoop to mine,
 Flowers of decay of no immortal seed.

 Yet, love, if in thy lofty dwelling-place,
 Higher than notes of any soaring bird,
 Beyond the beam of any solar light,
 A song of earth may scale the awful height,
 And at thy heavenly window find thy face - 
 know my voice shall never fall unheard.

December 6th, 1894.
