An Excellent New Song.


Tune. "Buy broom besoms."

Wha will buy my troggin,
Fine election ware;
Broken trade o' Broughton,
A' in high repair.
Buy braw troggin,
Frae the banks o' Dee;
Wha wants troggin
Let him come to me.

There's a noble Earl's[1]
Fame and high renown
For an auld sang,
It's thought the gudes were stown.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here's the worth o' Broughton[2]
In a needle's ee;
Here's a reputation
Tint by Balmaghie.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here's an honest conscience
Might a prince adorn;
Frae the downs o' Tinwald,[3]
So was never worn.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here's its stuff and lining,
Cardoness'[4] head;
Fine for a sodger
A' the wale o' lead.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here's a little wadset
Buittle's[5] scrap o' truth,
Pawn'd in a gin-shop
Quenching holy drouth.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here's armorial bearings
Frae the manse o' Urr;[6]
The crest, an auld crab-apple
Rotten at the core.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here is Satan's picture,
Like a bizzard gled,
Pouncing poor Redcastle,[7]
Sprawlin' as a taed.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here's the worth and wisdom
Collieston[8] can boast;
By a thievish midge
They had been nearly lost.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Here is Murray's fragments
O' the ten commands;
Gifted by black Jock[9]
To get them aff his hands.
Buy braw troggin, &amp;c.

Saw ye e'er sic troggin?
If to buy ye're slack,
Hornie's turnin' chapman,
He'll buy a' the pack.
Buy braw troggin,
Frae the banks o' Dee;
Wha wants troggin
Let him come to me.
