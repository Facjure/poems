Maud Muller all that summer day
Raked the meadow sweet with hay;

Yet, looking down the distant lane,
She hoped the Judge would come again.

But when he came, with smile and bow,
Maud only blushed, and stammered, �Ha-ow?�

And spoke of her �pa,� and wondered whether
He�d give consent they should wed together.

Old Muller burst in tears, and then
Begged that the Judge would lend him �ten;�

For trade was dull, and wages low,
And the �craps,� this year, were somewhat slow.

And ere the languid summer died,
Sweet Maud became the Judge�s bride.

But on the day that they were mated,
Maud�s brother Bob was intoxicated;

And Maud�s relations, twelve in all,
Were very drunk at the Judge�s hall.

And when the summer came again,
The young bride bore him babies twain;

And the Judge was blest, but thought it strange
That bearing children made such a change;

For Maud grew broad and red and stout,
And the waist that his arm once clasped about

Was more than he now could span; and he
Sighed as he pondered, ruefully,

How that which in Maud was native grace
In Mrs. Jenkins was out of place;

And thought of the twins, and wished that they
Looked less like the men who raked the hay

On Muller�s farm, and dreamed with pain
Of the day he wandered down the lane.

And looking down that dreary track,
He half regretted that he came back;

For, had he waited, he might have wed
Some maiden fair and thoroughbred;

For there be women fair as she,
Whose verbs and nouns do more agree.

Alas for maiden! alas for judge!
And the sentimental, that�s one-half �fudge;�

For Maud soon thought the Judge a bore,
With all his learning and all his lore;

And the Judge would have bartered Maud�s fair face
For more refinement and social grace.

If, of all words of tongue and pen,
The saddest are, �It might have been,�

More sad are these we daily see:
�It is, but hadn�t ought to be.�
