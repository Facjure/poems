 You who to the rounded prime
Of a life of toil and stress,
 Still have kept the morning-time
 Of glad youth in heart and spirit,
 So your laugh, as children hear it,
Seems their own, no less, - 
 Take this book of childish rhyme - 
The Book of Joyous Children.

 Their first happiness on earth
Here is echoed - their first glee:
 Rich, in sooth, the volume's worth - 
 Not in classic lore, but rich in
 The child-sagas of the kitchen; - 
Therefore, take from me
 To your heart of childish mirth
The Book of Joyous Children.
