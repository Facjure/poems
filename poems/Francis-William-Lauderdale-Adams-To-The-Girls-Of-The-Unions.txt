title: To The Girls Of The Unions.

 Girls, we love you, and love
Asks you to give again
 That which draws it above,
Beautiful, without stain.

 Give us weariless faith
In our Cause pure, passionate,
 Dearer than life and death,
Dear as the love that's it!

 Give to the man who turns
Traitrous hands or forlorn
 Back from the plough that burns,
Give him pitiless scorn!

 Let him know that no wife
Would bear him a fearless child
 To hate and loathe the life
Of a leprous father defiled.

 Girls, we love you, and love
Asks you to give again
 That which draws it above,
Beautiful, without stain!
