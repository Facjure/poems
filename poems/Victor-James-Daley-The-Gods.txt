Last night, as one who hears a tragic jest,
I woke from dreams, half-laughing, half in tears;
Methought that I had journeyed in the spheres
And stood upon the Planet of the Blest!
And found thereon a folk who prayed with zest
Exceeding, and through all their painful years,
Like strong souls struggled on, �mid hopes and fears;
�Where dwell the gods,� they said, �we shall find rest.�
The gods? What gods, I thought, are these who so
Inspire their worshippers with faith that flowers
Immortal, and who make them keep aglow
The flames for ever on their altar-towers?
�Where dwell these gods of yours?� I asked, and lo!
They pointed upward to this earth of ours!
