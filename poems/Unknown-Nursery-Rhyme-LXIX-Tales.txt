A dog and a cock,
A journey once took,
They travell'd along till 'twas late;
The dog he made free
In the hollow of a tree,
And the cock on the boughs of it sate.

The cock nothing knowing,
In the morn fell a crowing,
Upon which comes a fox to the tree;
Says he, I declare,
Your voice is above,
All the creatures I ever did see.

Oh! would you come down
I the fav'rite might own,
Said the cock, there's a porter below;
If you will go in,
I promise I'll come down.
So he went - and was worried for it too.
