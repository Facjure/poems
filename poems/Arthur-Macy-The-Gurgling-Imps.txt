 The Gurgling Imps of Mummery Mum
 Lived in the Land of the Crimson Plum,
 And a language very strange had they,
 'Twas merely a chattering ricochet.

 The Gurgling Imps of Mummery Mum
 Caught hummingbirds for the sake of the hum,
 Their cheeks were flushed with a sable tinge,
 Their eyelids hung on a silver hinge.

 The Gurgling Imps of Mummery Mum
 Called each other "My charming chum,"
 And floated in tears of joy to see
 Their relatives hung in a cranberry tree.

 The Gurgling Imps of Mummery Mum
 Stole the whole of a half of a crumb,
 And a wind arose and blew the Imps
 Way off to the Land of the Lazy Limps.
