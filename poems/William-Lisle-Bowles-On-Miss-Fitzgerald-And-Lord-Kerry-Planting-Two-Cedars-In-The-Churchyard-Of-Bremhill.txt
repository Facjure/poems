title: On Miss Fitzgerald And Lord Kerry Planting Two Cedars In The Churchyard Of Bremhill.

 Yes, Pamela, this infant tree
 Planted in sacred earth by thee,
 Shall strike its root, and pleasant grow
 Whilst I am mouldering dust below.
 This churchyard turf shall still be green,
 When other pastors here are seen,
 Who, gazing on that dial gray,
 Shall mourn, like me, life's passing ray.
 What says its monitory shade?
 Thyself so blooming, now shalt fade;
 And even that fair and lightsome boy,
 Elastic as the step of joy,
 The future lord of yon domain,
 And all this wide extended plain,
 Shall yield to creeping time, when they
 Who loved him shall have passed away.
 Yet, planted by his youthful hand,
 The fellow-cedar still shall stand,
 And when it spreads its boughs around,
 Shading the consecrated ground,
 He may behold its shade, and say
 (Himself then haply growing gray),
 Yes, I remember, aged tree,
 When I was young who planted thee!
 But long may time, blithe maiden, spare
 Thy beaming eyes and crisped hair,
 Thy unaffected converse kind,
 Thy gentle and ingenuous mind.
 For him when I in dust repose,
 May virtue guide him as he grows;
 And may he, when no longer young,
 Resemble those from whom he sprung!
 Then let these trees extend their shade,
 Or live or die, or bloom or fade,
 Virtue, uninjured and sublime,
 Shall lift her brightest wreath, untouched by time.
