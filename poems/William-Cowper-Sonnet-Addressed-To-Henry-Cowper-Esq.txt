On His Emphatical And Interesting Delivery Of The Defence Of Warren Hastings, Esq., In The House Of Lords.


Cowper, whose silver voice, task�d sometimes hard,
Legends prolix delivers in the ears
(Attentive when thou read�st) of England�s peers,
Let verse at length yield thee thy just reward.


Thou wast not heard with drowsy disregard,
Expending late on all that length of plea
Thy generous powers, but silence honour�d thee,
Mute as e�er gazed on orator or bard.


Thou art not voice alone, but hast beside
Both heart and head; and couldst with music sweet
Of Attic phrase and senatorial tone,
Like thy renown�d forefathers, far and wide
Thy fame diffuse, praised not for utterance meet
Of others� speech, but magic of thy own.
