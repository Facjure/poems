title: The Curse Of The Wandering Foot.
---

All hope of rest withdrawn me? - 
What dread command hath put
This awful curse upon me - 
The curse of the wandering foot!
Forward and backward and thither,
And hither and yon again - 
Wandering ever!And whither?
Answer them, God!Amen.

The blue skies are far o'er me - -
The bleak fields near below:
Where the mother that bore me? - 
Where her grave in the snow? - 
Glad in her trough of a coffin - 
The sad eyes frozen shut
That wept so often, often,
The curse of the wandering foot!

Here in your marts I care not
Whatsoever ye think.
Good folk many who dare not
Give me to eat and drink:
Give me to sup of your pity - 
Feast me on prayers! - O ye,
Met I your Christ in the city
He would fare forth with me - 

Forward and onward and thither,
And hither again and yon,
With milk for our drink together
And honey to feed upon - 
Nor hope of rest withdrawn us,
Since the one Father put
The blessï¿½d curse upon us - 
The curse of the wandering foot.
