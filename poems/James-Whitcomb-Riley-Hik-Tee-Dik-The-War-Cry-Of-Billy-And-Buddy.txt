title: Hik-Tee-Dik! - The War-Cry Of Billy And Buddy
---

 When two little boys - renowned but for noise - 
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! - 
 May hurt a whole school, and the head it employs,
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
 Such loud and hilarious pupils indeed
 Need learning - and yet something further they need,
 Though fond hearts that love them may sorrow and bleed.
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!

 O the schoolmarm was cool, and in no wise a fool;
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
 And in ruling her ranks it was her rule to rule;
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
 So when these two pupils conspired, every day,
 Some mad piece of mischief, with whoop and hoo-ray,
 That hurt yet defied her, - how happy were they! - 
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!

 At the ring of the bell they 'd rush in with a yell - 
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
 And they'd bang the school-door till the plastering fell,
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
 They'd clinch as they came, and pretend not to see
 As they knocked her desk over - then, My! and O-me!
 How awfully sorry they'd both seem to be!
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!



 This trick seemed so neat and so safe a conceit, - 
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy! - 
 They played it three times - though the third they were beat;
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
 For the teacher, she righted her desk - raised the lid
 And folded and packed away each little kid - 
 Closed the incident so - yes, and locked it, she did - 
Hik-tee-dik! Billy and Buddy!
