title: How are You, Sanitary?
---

Down the picket-guarded lane
Rolled the comfort-laden wain,
Cheered by shouts that shook the plain,
Soldier-like and merry:
Phrases such as camps may teach,
Sabre-cuts of Saxon speech,
Such as �Bully!� �Them�s the peach!�
�Wade in, Sanitary!�

Right and left the caissons drew
As the car went lumbering through,
Quick succeeding in review
Squadrons military;
Sunburnt men with beards like frieze,
Smooth-faced boys, and cries like these,
�U. S. San. Com.� �That�s the cheese!�
�Pass in, Sanitary!�

In such cheer it struggled on
Till the battle front was won:
Then the car, its journey done,
Lo! was stationary;
And where bullets whistling fly
Came the sadder, fainter cry,
�Help us, brothers, ere we die,
Save us, Sanitary!�

Such the work. The phantom flies,
Wrapped in battle clouds that rise:
But the brave whose dying eyes,
Veiled and visionary,
See the jasper gates swung wide,
See the parted throng outside
Hears the voice to those who ride:
�Pass in, Sanitary!�
