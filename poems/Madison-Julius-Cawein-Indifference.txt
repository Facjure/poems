 She is so dear the wildflowers near
 Each path she passes by,
 Are over fain to kiss again
 Her feet and then to die.

 She is so fair the wild birds there
 That sing upon the bough,
 Have learned the staff of her sweet laugh,
 And sing no other now.

 Alas! that she should never see,
 Should never care to know,
 The wildflower's love, the bird's above,
 And his, who loves her so!
