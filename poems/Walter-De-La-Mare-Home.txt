 Rest, rest - there is no rest,
 Until the quiet grave
 Comes with its narrow arch
The heart to save
 From life's long cankering rust,
 From torpor, cold and still - 
 The loveless, saddened dust,
The jaded will.

 And yet, be far the hour
 Whose haven calls me home;
 Long be the arduous day
Till evening come;
 What sureness now remains
 But that through livelong strife
 Only the loser gains
An end to life?

 Then in the soundless deep
 Of even the shallowest grave
 Childhood and love he'll keep,
And his soul save;
 All vext desire, all vain
 Cries of a conflict done
 Fallen to rest again;
Death's refuge won.
