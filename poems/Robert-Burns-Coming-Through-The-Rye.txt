Tune - "Coming through the rye."


I.

Coming through the rye, poor body,
Coming through the rye,
She draiglet a' her petticoatie,
Coming through the rye.
Jenny's a' wat, poor body,
Jenny's seldom dry;
She draiglet a' her petticoatie,
Coming through the rye.

II.

Gin a body meet a body
Coming through the rye,
Gin a body kiss a body
Need a body cry?

III.

Gin a body meet a body
Coming through the glen,
Gin a body kiss a body
Need the world ken?
Jenny's a' wat, poor body;
Jenny's seldom dry;
She draiglet a' her petticoatie,
Coming through the rye.
