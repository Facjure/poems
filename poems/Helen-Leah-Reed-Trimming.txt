When your father, long ago, tried to train you - and you know
He thought mornings meant for school, and not for swimming - 
How your heart beat loud in dread as relentlessly he said,
"You'llremember - when you've had another trimming."

When your daughter buys a hat, and you're wondering thereat,
As before the glass she stands, its beauty hymning;
Ah! the mischief in her eyes, as she pleads, "Show no surprise
At thecost. One has to pay forpretty trimming."

When the butcher brings your bill, and you stare at it until
Your tongue with fervid words is fairly brimming,
Then you hear him meekly say, as your anger you display,
"It seems high, because there's so muchwaste in trimming."

So when politicians try your votes to beg or buy
With their sophistry - your common sense that's dimming - 
Justremember then thecost (and thewaste, should all be lost),
Of the smooth-tongued, wordy trimmer'spretty trimming.
