They bloom up the fresh, green trellis
 In airy, vigorous ease,
And their fragrant, sensuous honey
 Is best beloved of the bees.

Oh! the rose knows the dainty secret
 How the morning-glory blows,
For the rose told me the secret,
 And the jessamine told the rose.

And the jessamine said at midnight,
 Ere the red cock woke and crew,
That the fays of queen Titania
 Came there to bathe in the dew.

And the merry moonlight glistened
 On wet, long, yellow hair,
And their feet on the flowers drowsy
 Trod softer than any air.

And their petticoats, gay as bubbles,
 They hung up every one
On the morning-glories' tendrils
 Till their moonlight bath were done.

But the red cock crew too early,
 And the fays left hurriedly,
And this is why in the morning
 Their petticoats there you see.
