Who is Sylvia? What is she
 That early every morning
You desert your family
 And rush to see her, scorning
Your once cherished ma and me?

Are her playthings such a treat?
 I will steal 'em from her;
Better that than not to meet
 My son and heir all summer,
Save when he comes home to eat.

Or is she herself the one
 And only real attraction?
Has your little heart begun
 To get that sort of action?
Better wait a few years, son.
