 Not for thyself, but for the sake of Song,
 Strive to succeed as others have, who gave
 Their lives unto her; shaping sure and strong
 Her lovely limbs that made them god and slave.

 Not for thyself, but for the sake of Art,
 Strive to advance beyond the others' best;
 Winning a deeper secret from her heart
 To hang it moonlike 'mid the starry rest.
