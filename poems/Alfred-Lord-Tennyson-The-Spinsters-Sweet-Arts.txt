Milk for my sweet-arts, Bess! fur it mun be the time about now
When dolly cooms in fro� the far-end close wi� her pa�ils fro� the cow.
Eh! tha be new to the pla�ce�thou�rt ga�pin��doesn�t tha see
I calls �em arter the fellers es once was sweet upo� me?

II

Na�y to be sewer it be past �er time. What ma�kes �er sa la�te?
Goa to the la�ne at the back, an� loo�k thruf Maddison�s ga�te!

III

Sweet-arts! Molly belike may �a lighted to-night upo� one.
Sweet-arts! thanks to the Lord that I niver not listen�d to no�n!
So I sits i� my o�n armchair wi� my o�n kettle theere o� the hob,
An� Tommy the fust, an� Tommy the second, an� Steevie an� Rob.

IV

Rob, coom cop �ere o� my knee. Thou sees that i� spite o� the men
I �a kep� thruf thick an� thin my two �oonderd a-year to mysen;
Yis! thaw tha call�d me es pretty es ony lass i� the Shere;
An� thou be es pretty a Tabby, but Robby I seed thruf ya theere.

V

Feyther �ud sa�y I wur ugly es sin, an� I be�nt not va�in,
But I niver wur downright hugly, thaw soom �ud �a thowt ma pla�in,
An� I wasn�t sa pla�in i� pink ribbons, ye said I wur pretty i� pinks,
An� I liked to �ear it I did, but I brunt sich a fool as ye thinks;
Ye was stro�kin ma down wi� the �air, as I be a-stro�kin o� you,
But whiniver I loo�ked i� the glass I wur sewer that it couldn�t be true;
Niver wur pretty, not I, but ye knaw�d it wur pleasant to �ear,
Thaw it warn�t not me es wur pretty, but my two �oonderd a-year.

VI

D�ya mind the murnin� when we was a-walkin� togither, an� stood
By the cla�y�d-oop pond, that the foalk be sa scared at, i� Gigglesby wood,
Wheer the poor wench drowndid hersen, black Sal, es�ed been disgra�ced?
An� I feel�d thy arm es I stood wur a-cree�pin about my wa�ist;
An� me es wur allus afear�d of a man�s gittin� over fond,
I sidled awa�y an� awa�y till I plumpt foot fust i� the pond;
And, Robby, I niver �a liked tha sa well, as I did that da�y,
Fur tha joompt in thysen, an� tha hoickt my feet wi� a flop fro� the cla�y.
Ay, stick oop thy back, an� set oop thy ta�il, tha may gie ma a kiss,
Fur I walk�d wi� tha all the way hoam an� wur niver sa nigh sa�yin� Yis.
But wa boath was i� sich a clat we was sha�med to cross Gigglesby Gree�n,
Fur a cat may loo�k at a king thou knaws but the cat mun be clean.
Sa we bo�th on us kep out o� sight o� the winders o� Gigglesby Hinn�
Na�y, but the claws o� tha! quiet! they pricks clean thruf to the skin�
An� wa bo�th slinkt �o�m by the brokken shed i� the la�ne at the back,
Wheer the poodle runn�d at tha once, an� thou runn�d oop o� the thack;
An� tha squeedg�d my �and i� the shed, fur theere we was forced to �ide,
Fur I seed that Steevie wur coomin�, and one o� the Tommies beside.

VII

Theere now, what art �a mewin at, Steevie? for owt I can tell�
Robby wur fust to be sewer, or I mowt �a liked tha as well.

VIII

But, Robby, I thowt o� tha all the while I wur cha�ngin� my gown,
An� I thowt shall I cha�nge my sta�te? but, O Lord, upo� coomin� down�
My bran-new carpet es fresh es a midder o� flowers i� Ma�y�
Why �edn�t tha wiped thy shoes? it wur clatted all ower wi� cla�y.
An� I could �a cried ammost, fur I seed that it couldn�t be,
An� Robby I gied tha a ra�tin that sattled thy coortin o� me.
An� Molly an� me was agreed, as we was a-cleanin� the floor,
That a man be a durty thing an� a trouble an� plague wi� indoor.
But I rued it arter a bit, fur I stuck to tha moor na the rest,
But I couldn�t �a lived wi� a man an� I knaws it be all fur the best.

IX

Na�y�let ma stro�k tha down till I ma�kes tha es smooth es silk,
But if I �ed married tha, Robby, thou�d not �a been worth thy milk,
Thou�d niver �a cotch�d ony mice but �a left me the work to do,
And �a ta�en to the bottle beside, so es all that I �ears be true;
But I loovs tha to ma�ke thysen �appy, an� soa purr awa�y, my dear,
Thou �ed wellnigh purr�d ma awa�y fro� my o�n two �oonderd a-year.

X

Swe�rin agean, you Toms, as ye used to do twelve year sin�!
Ye niver �e�rd Steevie swear �cep� it wur at a dog coomin� in,
An� boath o� ye mun be fools to be hallus a-shawin� your claws,
Fur I niver cared nothink for neither�an� one o� ye de�d ye knaws!
Coom give ho�ver then, weant ye? I warrant ye soom fine da�y�
Theere, dig down�I shall hew to gie one or tother awa�y.
Can�t ye ta�ke pattern by Steevie? ye shant hew a drop fro� the pa�il.
Steevie be right good manners bang thruf to the tip o� the ta�il.

Xl.
Robby, git down wi�tha, wilt tha? let Steevie coom oop o� my knee.
Steevie, my lad, thou �ed very nigh been the Steevie fur me!
Robby wur fust to be sewer, �e wur burn an� bred i� the �ouse,
But thou be es �ansom a tabby es iver patted a mouse.

XII

An� I be�nt not va�in, but I knaws I �ed led tha a quieter life
Nor her wi� the hepitaph yonder! �A fa�ithfnl an� loovin� wife!�
An� �cos o� thy farm by the beck, an� thy windmill oop o� the croft,
Tha thowt tha would marry ma, did tha? but that wur a bit ower soft,
Thaw thou was es so�ber es da�y, wi� a niced red fa�ce, an� es cle�n
Es a shillin� fresh fro� the mint wi� a bran-new �e�d o� the Quee�n,
An� thy farmin� es cle�n es thysen�, fur, Steevie, tha kep� it sa ne�t
That I niver not spied sa much es a poppy along wi� the whe�t,
An� the wool of a thistle a-flyin� an� see�din� tha ha�ted to see;
�Twur es bad es a battle-twig1 �ere i� my o�n blue chaumber to me.
Ay, roob thy whiskers age�n ma, fur I could �a ta�en to tha well,
But fur thy bairns, poor Steevie, a bouncin� boy an� a gell.

XIII

An� thou was es fond o� thy bairns es I be mysen o� my cats,
But I niver not wish�d fur childer, I hevn�t naw likin� fur brats;
Pretty anew when ya dresses �em oop, an� they go�s fur a walk,
Or sits wi� their �ands afoor �em, an� doesn�t not �inder the talk!
But their bottles o� pap, an� their mucky bibs, an� the clats an� the clouts,
An� their mashin� their toys to pie�ces an� ma�kin� ma deaf wi� their shouts,
An� hallus a-joompin� about ma as if they was set upo� springs,
An� a haxin� ma hawkard questions, an� sa�yin� ondecent things,
Alt� a-callin� ma �hugly� mayhap to my fa�ce, or a te�rin� my gown�
Dear! dear! dear! I mun part them Tommies�Steevie git down.

XIV

Ye be wuss nor the men-tommies, you. I tell�d ya, na moor o� that!
Tom, lig theere o� the cushion, an� tother Tom �ere o� the mat.

XV

Theere! I ha� master�d them! Hed I married the Tommies�O Lord,
To loove an� oba�y the Tommies! I couldn�t �a stuck by my word.
To be horder�d about, an� wa�ked, when Molly �d put out the light,
By a man coomin� in wi� a hiccup at ony hour o� the night!
An� the ta�ble sta�in�d wi� �is a�le, an� the mud o� �is boots o� the stairs,
An� the stink o� �is pipe i� the �ouse, an� the mark o� �is �e�d o� the chairs!
An� noun o� my four sweet-arts �ud �a let me �a led my o�n wa�y,
Sa I likes �em best wi� ta�ils when they �evn�t a word to sa�y.

XVII

An� I sits i� my o�n little parlour, an� sarved by my o�n little lass,
Wi� my o�n little garden outside, an� my o�n bed o� sparrow-grass,
An� my o�n door-poorch wi the woodbine an� jessmine a-dressin� it gree�n,
An� my o�n fine Jackman i� purple a ro�bin� the �ouse like a Quee�n.

XVII

An� the little gells bobs to ma hoffens es I be abroad i� the la�nes,
When I go�s fur to coomfut the poor es be down wi� their ha�ches an� their pa�ins:
An� a ha�f-pot o� jam, or a mossel o� me�t when it be�nt too dear,
They ma�kes ma a gra�ter La�dy nor �er i� the mansion theer,
Hes �es hallus to hax of a man how much to spare or to spend;
An� a spinster I be an� I will be, if so� ple�se God, to the hend.

XVIII

Mew! mew!�Bess wi� the milk! what ha ma�de our Molly sa la�te?
It should �a been �ere by seven, an� theere�it be strikin� height�
�Cushie wur cra�zed fur�er cauf� well�I �e�rd �er a ma�kin� �er mo�n,
An� I thowt to mysen �thank God that I hevn�t naw cauf o� my o�n.�
Theere!
Set it down!
Now Robby!
You Tommies shall wa�it to-night
Till Robby an� Steevie �es �ed their lap�an� it sarves ye right.
