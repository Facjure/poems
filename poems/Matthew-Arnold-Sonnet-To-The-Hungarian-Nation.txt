title: Sonnet To The Hungarian Nation
---

Not in sunk Spain�s prolong�d death agony;
Not in rich England, bent but to make pour
The flood of the world�s commerce on her shore;
Not in that madhouse, France, from whence the cry
Afflicts grave Heaven with its long senseless roar;
Not in American vulgarity,
Nor wordy German imbecility
Lies any hope of heroism more.
Hungarians! Save the world! Renew the stories
Of men who against hope repell�d the chain,
And make the world�s dead spirit leap again
On land renew that Greek exploit, whose glories
Hallow the Salaminian promontories,
And the Armada flung to the fierce main
