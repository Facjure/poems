The old days - the far days -
 The overdear and fair! -
The old days - the lost days -
 How lovely they were!
The old days of Morning,
 With the dew-drench on the flowers
And apple-buds and blossoms
 Of those old days of ours.

Then was the real gold
 Spendthrift Summer flung;
Then was the real song
 Bird or Poet sung!
There was never censure then, -
 Only honest praise -
And all things were worthy of it
 In the old days.

There bide the true friends -
 The first and the best;
There clings the green grass
 Close where they rest:
Would they were here? No; -
 Would we were there!...
The old days - the lost days -
 How lovely they were!
