title: At Christmas Time
---

 For that old love I once adored
 I decked my halls and spread my board
 At Christmas time.
 With all the winter�s flowers that grow
 I wreathed my room, and mistletoe
 Hung in the gloom of my doorway,
 Wherein my dear lost love might stray
 When joy-bells chime.

 What phantom was it entered there
 And drank his wine and took his chair
 At Christmas time?
 With holly boughs and mistletoe
 He crowned his head, and at my woe
 And tears I shed laughed long and loud;
 �Get back, O phantom! to thy shroud
 When joy-bells chime.�
