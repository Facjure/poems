title: God's Warmth Is She.
---

O glad sun, creeping through the casement wide,
 A million blossoms have you kissed since morn,
But none so fair as this one at my side - 
 Touch soft the bit of love, the babe new born.

Towards all the world my love and pity flow,
 With high resolves, with trust, with sympathy.
This happy heart of mine is all aglow - 
 This heart that was so cold - God's warmth is she.
