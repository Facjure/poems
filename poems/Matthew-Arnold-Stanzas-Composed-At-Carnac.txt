title: Stanzas Composed At Carnac

Far on its rocky knoll descried
Saint Michael�s chapel cuts the sky.
I climb�d; beneath me, bright and wide,
Lay the lone coast of Brittany.

Bright in the sunset, weird and still,
It lay beside the Atlantic wave,
As if the wizard Merlin�s will
Yet charm�d it from his forest grave.

Behind me on their grassy sweep,
Bearded with lichen, scrawl�d and grey,
The giant stones of Carnac sleep,
In the mild evening of the May.

No priestly stern procession now
Streams through their rows of pillars old;
No victims bleed, no Druids bow;
Sheep make the furze-grown aisles their fold.

From bush to bush the cuckoo flies,
The orchis red gleams everywhere;
Gold broom with furze in blossom vies,
The blue-bells perfume all the air.

And o�er the glistening, lonely land,
Rise up, all round, the Christian spires.
The church of Carnac, by the strand,
Catches the westering sun�s last fires.

And there across the watery way,
See, low above the tide at flood,
The sickle-sweep of Quiberon bay
Whose beach once ran with loyal blood!

And beyond that, the Atlantic wide!
All round, no soul, no boat, no hail!
But, on the horizon�s verge descried,
Hangs, touch�d with light, one snowy sail!

Ah, where is he, who should have come
Where that far sail is passing now,
Past the Loire�s mouth, and by the foam
Of Finist�re�s unquiet brow,

Home, round into the English wave?
He tarries where the Rock of Spain
Mediterranean waters lave;
He enters not the Atlantic main.

Oh, could he once have reach�d this air
Freshen�d by plunging tides, by showers!
Have felt this breath he loved, of fair
Cool northern fields, and grass, and flowers!

He long�d for it, press�d on! In vain.
At the Straits fail�d that spirit brave.
The South was parent of his pain,
The South is mistress of his grave.
