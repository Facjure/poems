However the battle is ended,
 Though proudly the victor comes
With fluttering flags and prancing nags
 And echoing roll of drums,
Still truth proclaims this motto
 In letters of living light, - 
No question is ever settled
 Until it is settled right.

Though the heel of the strong oppressor
 May grind the weak in the dust;
And the voices of fame with one acclaim
 May call him great and just,
Let those who applaud take warning.
 And keep this motto in sight, - 
No question is ever settled
 Until it is settled right.

Let those who have failed take courage;
 Though the enemy seems to have won,
Though his ranks are strong, if he be in the wrong
 The battle is not yet done;
For, sure as the morning follows
 The darkest hour of the night,
No question is ever settled
 Until it is settled right.

O man bowed down with labour!
 O woman young, yet old!
O heart oppressed in the toiler's breast
 And crushed by the power of gold
Keep on with your weary battle
 Against triumphant might;
No question is ever settled
 Until it is settled right.
