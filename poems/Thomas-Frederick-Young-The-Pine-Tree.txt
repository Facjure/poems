The wind last night was wild and strong,
 It shriek'd, it whistl'd and it roar'd,
And went with whirl and swoop along,
 'Mid falling trees and crashing board.

The timbers creak'd, the rafters sway'd,
 And e'en some roofs, upheav'd and torn,
Came crashing to the earth, and laid
 Before the view, upon the morn.

The air seem'd like some monstrous thing,
 By its uncurbed passion held;
Like dreadful dragon on the wing,
 So horribly it scream'd and yell'd.

Now venting a triumphant shout,
 And ever and anon a groan,
Like fiend from prison lately out,
 Or like unhappy chain'd one's moan.

There was a lofty pine I knew;
 Each morn and eve I passed it by;
To such a lofty height it grew,
 It caught at once each passing eye.

It stood alone, and proudly stood,
 With straight, and clean, and lofty stem;
All other trees it seemed to view,
 As though it scorn'd to live with them.

Full many a winter's snow had whirl'd
 About its base, and settl'd there,
And many an autumn mist had curl'd
 About its head, so high in air.

Full many a blast had spent, in vain,
 Its force, for, ever like a rock,
It stood each persevering strain,
 And long defied the tempest's shock.

But yesternight it crashing fell,
 And now, this morn, I see it lie.
I knew the brave old tree so well,
 A tear almost bedims my eye.

But brave old trees, like brave old men,
 Must feel at last the fatal stroke,
That dashest them to earth again,
 Tho' lofty pine, or mighty oak.

I'll miss, old tree, thy lofty stem
 Outlin'd against the distant sky,
But 'tis no gain to fret for them - 
 For men, or trees, that fall and die.
