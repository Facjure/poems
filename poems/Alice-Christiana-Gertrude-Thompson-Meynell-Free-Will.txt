 Dear are some hidden things
My soul has sealed in silence; past delights,
 Hope unconfessed; desires with hampered wings,
Remembered in the nights.

 But my best treasures are
Ignoble, undelightful, abject, cold;
 Yet O! profounder hoards oracular
No reliquaries hold.

 There lie my trespasses,
Abjured but not disowned.Iï¿½ll not accuse
 Determinism, nor, as the Master {26} says,
Charge even "the poor Deuce."

 Under my hand they lie,
My very own, my proved iniquities,
 And though the glory of my life go by
I hold and garner these.

 How else, how otherwhere.
How otherwise, shall I discern and grope
 For lowliness?How hate, how love, how dare,
How weep, how hope?
