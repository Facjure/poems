title: How Will It Be?
---

How will it be when one of us alone
 Goes on that strange last journey of the soul?
That certain search for an uncertain goal,
 That voyage on which no comradeship is known?
Will our dear sea sing with the old sweet tone,
 Though one sits stricken where its billows roll?
Will space be dumb, or from the mystic pole
 Will spirit-messages be backward blown?
When our united lives are wrenched apart,
 And day no more means fond companionship,
When fervent night, and lovely languorous dawn,
 Are only memories to one sad heart,
And but in dreams love-kisses burn the lip, - 
 Dear God, how can this same fair world move on?
