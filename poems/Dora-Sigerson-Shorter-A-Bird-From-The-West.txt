title: A Bird From The West
---

 At the grey dawn, amongst the felling leaves,
A little bird outside my window swung,
 High on a topmost branch he trilled his song,
And �Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!� ever sung.

 Take me, I cried, back to my island home;
Sweet bird, my soul shall ride between thy wings;
 For my lone spirit wide his pinions spread,
And home and home and home he ever sings.

 We lingered over Ulster stern and wild.
I called: �Arise! doth none remember me?�
 One turn�d in the darkness murmuring,
�How loud upon the breakers sobs the sea!�

 We rested over Connaught-whispering said:
�Awake, awake, and welcome!I am here.�
 One woke and shivered at the morning grey;
�The trees, I never heard them sigh so drear.�

 We flew low over Munster.Long I wept:
�You used to love me, love me once again!�
 They spoke from out the shadows wondering;
�You�d think of tears, so bitter falls the rain.�

 Long over Leinster lingered we. �Good-bye!
My best beloved, good-bye for evermore.�
 Sleepless they tossed and whispered to the dawn;
�So sad a wind was never heard before.�

 Was it a dream I dreamt?For yet there swings
In the grey morn a bird upon the bough,
 And �Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!� ever sings.
Oh! fair the breaking day in Ireland now.
