Flower! Flower, why repine?
 God knows each creature's place;
He hides within me when I shine,
 And your leaves hide His face.

And you are near as I to Him,
 And you reveal as much
Of that eternal soundless hymn
 Man's words may never touch.

God sings to man through all my rays
 That wreathe the brow of night,
And walks with me thro' all my ways --
 The everlasting light.

Flower! Flower, why repine?
 He chose on lowly earth,
And not in heaven where I shine,
 His Bethlehem and birth.

Flower! Flower, I see Him pass
 Each hour of night and day,
Down to an altar and a Mass
 Go thou! and fade away.

Fade away upon His shrine!
 Thy light is brighter far
Than all the light wherewith I shine
 In heaven, as a star.
