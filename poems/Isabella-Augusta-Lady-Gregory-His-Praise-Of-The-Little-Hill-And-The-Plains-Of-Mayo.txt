title: His Praise Of The Little Hill And The Plains Of Mayo

	After the Christmas, with the help of Christ, I will never stop if I am alive; I will go to the sharp-edged little hill; for it is a fine place without fog falling; a blessed placethatthe sun shines on, and the wind doesn't rise there or anything of the sort.

	And if you were a year there you would get no rest, only sitting up at night and forever drinking.The lamb and the sheep are there; the cow and the calf are there, fine lands are there withoutheath and without bog. Ploughing &amp; seed-sowing in the right month, plough and harrow prepared and ready; the rent that is called for there, they have means to pay it. There is oats and flax &amp; large eared barley. There are beautifulvalleys with good growth in them and hay. Rods grow there, and bushes and tufts, white fields are there and respect for trees; shade and shelter from wind and rain; priests and friars reading their book; spending and getting is there, and nothing scarce.

	I leave it in my will that my heart rises as the wind rises, and as the fog scatters, when I think upon Carra and the two towns below it, on the two-mile bush and on the plains of Mayo. And if I were standing in the middle of my people, age would go from me and I would be young again.
