I flow beneath the columns that upbear
 The world, and all the tracts of heaven and hell;
 Foamless I sweep, where sounds nor glimmers tell
My motion nadir-ward; no moment's flare
Gives each to each the shapes that, unaware,
 Commingle at my verge, to test the spell
 Of waves intense with night, whose deeps compel
One face from pain, and rapture, and despair.

The fruitless earth's denied and cheated sons
 Meet here, where fruitful and unfruitful cease.
And when their lords, the mightier, hidden Ones,
 Have drained all worlds till being's wine is low,
 Shall they not come, and from the oblivious flow
 Drink at one draught a universe of peace?
