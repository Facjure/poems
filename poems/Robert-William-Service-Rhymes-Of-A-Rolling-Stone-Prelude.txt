title: Rhymes Of A Rolling Stone - Prelude
---

 I sing no idle songs of dalliance days,
 No dreams Elysian inspire my rhyming;
 I have no Celia to enchant my lays,
 No pipes of Pan have set my heart to chiming.
 I am no wordsmith dripping gems divine
 Into the golden chalice of a sonnet;
 If love songs witch you, close this book of mine,
Waste no time on it.

 Yet bring I to my work an eager joy,
 A lusty love of life and all things human;
 Still in me leaps the wonder of the boy,
 A pride in man, a deathless faith in woman.
 Still red blood calls, still rings the valiant fray;
 Adventure beacons through the summer gloaming:
 Oh long and long and long will be the day
Ere I come homing!

 This earth is ours to love: lute, brush and pen,
 They are but tongues to tell of life sincerely;
 The thaumaturgic Day, the might of men,
 O God of Scribes, grant us to grave them clearly!
 Grant heart that homes in heart, then all is well.
 Honey is honey-sweet, howe'er the hiving.
 Each to his work, his wage at evening bell
The strength of striving.
