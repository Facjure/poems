 And so when he reached my bed
 The General made a stand:
 "My brave young fellow," he said,
 "I would shake your hand."

 So I lifted my arm, the right,
 With never a hand at all;
 Only a stump, a sight
 Fit to appal.

 "Well, well. Now that's too bad!
 That's sorrowful luck," he said;
 "But there! You give me, my lad,
 The left instead."

 So from under the blanket's rim
 I raised and showed him the other,
 A snag as ugly and grim
 As its ugly brother.

 He looked at each jagged wrist;
 He looked, but he did not speak;
 And then he bent down and kissed
 Me on either cheek.

 You wonder now I don't mind
 I hadn't a hand to offer. . . .
 They tell me (you know I'm blind)
 'TWAS GRAND-PE�RE JOFFRE.
