title: Lightnings May Flicker Round My Head
---

Lightnings may flicker round my head,
And all the world seem doom,
If you, like a wild rose, will walk
Strangely into the room.

If only my sad heart may hear
Your voice of faery laughter - 
What matters though the heavens fall,
And hell come thundering after.
