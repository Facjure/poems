"How beautiful it is, mamma,
That God should love us all;
That He should listen to their prayer,
When little children call!

"What shall I do for him, mamma?
For He's so kind to me,--
How shall I show my love to Him
Who made bird, flower and tree?"

"The only thing which you can do
Is this, my darling child,
Be always gentle, full of love,
In words and actions mild.

"Thus you will show your love to God
Who is so kind to you;
And you will live with Him at last
In His bright heaven, too."
