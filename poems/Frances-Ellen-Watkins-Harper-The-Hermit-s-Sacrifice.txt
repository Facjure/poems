 From Rome's palaces and villas
 Gaily issued forth a throng;
 From her humbler habitations
 Moved a human tide along.

 Haughty dames and blooming maidens,
 Men who knew not mercy's sway,
 Thronged into the Coliseum
 On that Roman holiday.

 From the lonely wilds of Asia,
 From her jungles far away,
 From the distant torrid regions,
 Rome had gathered beasts of prey.

 Lions restless, roaring, rampant,
 Tigers with their stealthy tread,
 Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery,
 Met in conflict wild and dread.

 Fierce and fearful was the carnage
 Of the maddened beasts of prey,
 As they fought and rent each other
 Urged by men more fierce than they.

 Till like muffled thunders breaking
 On a vast and distant shore,
 Fainter grew the yells of tigers,
 And the lions' dreadful roar.

 On the crimson-stained arena
 Lay the victims of the fight;
 Eyes which once had glared with anguish,
 Lost in death their baleful light.

 Then uprose the gladiators
 Armed for conflict unto death,
 Waiting for the prefect's signal,
 Cold and stern with bated breath.

 "Ave Caesar, morituri,
 Te, salutant," rose the cry
 From the lips of men ill-fated,
 Doomed to suffer and to die.

 Then began the dreadful contest,
 Lives like chaff were thrown away,
 Rome with all her pride and power
 Butchered for a holiday.

 Eagerly the crowd were waiting,
 Loud the clashing sabres rang;
 When between the gladiators
 All unarmed a hermit sprang.


 "Cease your bloodshed," cried the hermit,
 "On this carnage place your ban;"
 But with flashing swords they answered,
 "Back unto your place, old man."

 From their path the gladiators
 Thrust the strange intruder back,
 Who between their hosts advancing
 Calmly parried their attack.

 All undaunted by their weapons,
 Stood the old heroic man;
 While a maddened cry of anger
 Through the vast assembly ran.

 "Down with him," cried out the people,
 As with thumbs unbent they glared,
 Till the prefect gave the signal
 That his life should not be spared.

 Men grew wild with wrathful passion,
 When his fearless words were said
 Cruelly they fiercely showered
 Stones on his devoted head.

 Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit,
 Victor in that hour of strife;
 Gaining in his death a triumph
 That he could not win in life.

 Had he uttered on the forum
 Struggling thoughts within him born,
 Men had jeered his words as madness,
 But his deed they could not scorn.

 Not in vain had been his courage,
 Nor for naught his daring deed;
 From his grave his mangled body
 Did for wretched captives plead.

 From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful,
 Ceased her sport in human gore;
 And into her Coliseum
 Gladiators came no more.
