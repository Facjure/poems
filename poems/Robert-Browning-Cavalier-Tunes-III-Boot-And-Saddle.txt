title: Cavalier Tunes - III - Boot And Saddle
---

I.
Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!
Rescue my castle before the hot day
Brightens to blue from its silvery grey,

(Chorus). Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!

II.
Ride past the suburbs, asleep as you�d say;
Many�s the friend there, will listen and pray
�God�s luck to gallants that strike up the lay,

(Chorus). �Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!�

III.
Forty miles off, like a roebuck at bay,
Flouts Castle Brancepeth the Roundheads� array:
Who laughs, �Good fellows ere this, by my fay,

(Chorus). �Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!�

IV.
Who? My wife Gertrude; that, honest and gay,
Laughs when you talk of surrendering, �Nay!
�I�ve better counsellors; what counsel they?

(Chorus). �Boot, saddle, to horse, and away!�
