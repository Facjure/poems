author: William Cowper 
title: Epitaph On Dr. Johnson.
---

Here Johnson lies�a sage by all allow�d,
Whom to have bred may well make England proud,
Whose prose was eloquence, by wisdom taught,
The graceful vehicle of virtuous thought;
Whose verse may claim�grave, masculine, and strong�
Superior praise to the mere poet�s song;
Who many a noble gift from heaven possess�d,
And faith at last, alone worth all the rest.
O man, immortal by a double prize,
By fame on earth�by glory in the skies!
