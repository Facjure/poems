A happy day at Whitsuntide,
As soon �s the zun begun to vall,
We all stroll�d up the steep hill-zide
To Meldon, gret an� small;
Out where the Castle wall stood high
A-mwoldren to the zunny sky.

An� there wi� Jenny took a stroll
Her youngest sister, Poll, so gay,
Bezide John Hind, ah! merry soul,
An� mid her wedlock fay;
An� at our zides did play an� run
My little maid an� smaller son.

Above the baten mwold upsprung
The driven doust, a-spreaden light,
An� on the new-leav�d thorn, a-hung,
Wer wool a-quiv�ren white;
An� corn, a-sheenen bright, did bow,
On slopen Meldon�s zunny brow.

There, down the roofless wall did glow
The zun upon the grassy vloor,
An� weakly-wandren winds did blow,
Unhinder�d by a door;
An� smokeless now avore the zun
Did stan� the ivy-girded tun.

My bwoy did watch the daws� bright wings
A-flappen vrom their ivy bow�rs;
My wife did watch my maid�s light springs,
Out here an� there vor flow�rs;
And John did zee noo tow�rs, the place
Vor him had only Polly�s face.

An� there, of all that pried about
The walls, I overlook�d em best,
An� what o� that? Why, I made out
Noo mwore than all the rest:
That there wer woonce the nest of zome
That wer a-gone avore we come.

When woonce above the tun the smoke
Did wreathy blue among the trees,
An� down below, the liven vo�k
Did tweil as brisk as bees:
Or zit wi� weary knees, the while
The sky wer lightless to their tweil.
