title: My Neighbour�s Garden
---

 Why in my neighbour�s garden
 Are the flowers more sweet than mine?
 I had never such bloom of roses,
 Such yellow and pink woodbine.

 Why in my neighbour�s garden
 Are the fruits all red and gold,
 While here the grapes are bitter
 That hang for my fingers� hold?

 Why in my neighbour�s garden
 Do the birds all fly to sing?
 Over the fence between us
 One would think �twas always spring.

 I thought my own wide garden
 Once more sweet and fair than all,
 Till I saw the gold and crimson
 Just over my neighbour�s wall.

 But now I want his thrushes,
 And now I want his vine,
 If I cannot have his cherries
 That grow more red than mine.

 The serpent �neath his apples
 Will tempt me to my fall,
 And then-I�ll steal my neighbour�s fruit
 Across the garden wall.
