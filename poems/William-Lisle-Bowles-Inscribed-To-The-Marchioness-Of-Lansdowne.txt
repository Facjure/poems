 Go to assemblies of the rich and gay,
 The blazing hall of grandeur, and the throng
 Of cities, and there listen to the song
 Of festive harmony; then pause, and say,
 Where is she found, who in her sphere might shine,
 Attracting all? Where is she found, whose place
 And dignity the proudest court might grace?
 Go, where the desolate and dying pine
 On their cold bed; open the cottage door;
 Ask of that aged pair, who feebly bend
 O'er their small evening fire, who is their friend;
 Ask of these children of the village poor;
 For this, at the great judgment, thou shalt find
 Heaven's mercy, Lady, merciful and kind.
