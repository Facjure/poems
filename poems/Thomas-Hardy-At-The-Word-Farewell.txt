title: At The Word "Farewell"
---

She looked like a bird from a cloud
 On the clammy lawn,
Moving alone, bare-browed
 In the dim of dawn.
The candles alight in the room
 For my parting meal
Made all things withoutdoors loom
 Strange, ghostly, unreal.

The hour itself was a ghost,
 And it seemed to me then
As of chances the chance furthermost
 I should see her again.
I beheld not where all was so fleet
 That a Plan of the past
Which had ruled us from birthtime to meet
 Was in working at last:

No prelude did I there perceive
 To a drama at all,
Or foreshadow what fortune might weave
 From beginnings so small;
But I rose as if quicked by a spur
 I was bound to obey,
And stepped through the casement to her
 Still alone in the gray.

"I am leaving you . . . Farewell!" I said,
 As I followed her on
By an alley bare boughs overspread;
 "I soon must be gone!"
Even then the scale might have been turned
 Against love by a feather,
- But crimson one cheek of hers burned
 When we came in together.
