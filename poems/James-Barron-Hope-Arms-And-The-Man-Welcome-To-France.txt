title: Arms And The Man. - Welcome To France.

But, in that fiery zone
She upriseth not alone,
Over all the bloody fields
Glitter Amazonian shields;
While through the mists of years
Another form appears,
And as I bow my head
Already you have said: - 
'Tis France!

Welcome to France!
From sea to sea,
With heart and hand!
Welcome to all within the land - 
Thrice welcome let her be!

And to France
The Union here to-day
Gives the right of this array,
And folds her to her breast
As the friend that she loves best.
Yes to France.
The proud Ruler of the West
Bows her sun-illumined crest,
Grave and slow,
In a passion of fond memories of
One hundred years ago!

France's colors wave again
High above this tented plain,
Stream and flaunt, and blaze and shine,
O'er the banner-painted brine,
Float and flow!
And the brazen trumpets blow
While upon her serried lines,
Full the light of Freedom shines
In a broad, effulgent glow.
And here this day I see
The fairest dream that ever yet
Was dreamt by History!

As in cadence, and in time,
To the martial throb and rhyme
Of her bugles and her drums
Forth a stately vision comes - 
Comes majestically slow - 
Comes a fair and stately vision of
One hundred years ago!

Welcome to France!
From sea to sea,
With heart and hand!
Welcome to all within the land!
Thrice welcome let her be!
Of Freedom's Guild made free!
Welcome!
Thrice Welcome!
Welcome let her be!

And as in days of old
Walter Raleigh did unfold
His gay cloak, with all its hems
Wrought in braided gold and gems,
That his Queen might passing tread
On the sumptuous cloth outspread,
And step on the shining fold
Or fair samnite rich in gold.
So for France - 
Splendid, grand, majestic France! - 
May Fortune down her mantle throw
To mend the way that she may go!

May GLORY leap before to reap - 
Up to the shoulders turned her sleeves - 
And FAME behind follow to bind
Unnumbered honors in unnumbered sheaves!
And may that mantle forever be
Under thy footfall, oh France the Free!
Forever and forever!
