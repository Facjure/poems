 I curtseyed to the dovecote.
I curtseyed to the well.
 I twirled me round and round about,
The morning sweets to smell.
 When out I came from spinning so,
Lo, betwixt green and blue
 Was the ghost of me - a Fairy Child - 
A-dancing - dancing, too.

 Nought was of her wearing
That is the earth's array.
 Her thistledown feet beat airy fleet
Yet set no blade astray.
 The gossamer shining dews of June
Showed grey against the green;
 Yet never so much as a bird-claw print
Of footfall to be seen.

 Fading in the mounting sun
That image soon did pine.
 Fainter than moonlight thinned the locks
That shone as clear as mine.
 Vanished! Vanished! O, sad it is
To spin and spin - in vain;
 And never to see the ghost of me
A-dancing there again.
