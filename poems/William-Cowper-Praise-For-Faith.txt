title: Praise For Faith.
---

Of all the gifts thine hand bestows,
Thou Giver of all good!
Not heaven itself a richer knows
Than my Redeemer�s blood.


Faith too, the blood-receiving grace,
From the same hand we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
That gift had been in vain.


Till thou thy teaching power apply,
Our hearts refuse to see,
And weak, as a distemper�d eye,
Shut out the view of thee.


Blind to the merits of thy Son,
What misery we endure!
Yet fly that hand from which alone
We could expect a cure.


We praise thee, and would praise thee more,
To thee our all we owe;
The precious Saviour, and the power
That makes him precious too.
