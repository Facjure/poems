 I.

Fleet swallows soared and darted
 'Neath empty vaults of blue;
Thick leaves close clung or parted
 To let the sunlight through;
Each wild rose, honey-hearted,
 Bowed full of living dew.


 II.

Down deep, fair fields of Heaven,
 Beat wafts of air and balm,
From southmost islands driven
 And continents of calm;
Bland winds by which were given
 Hid hints of rustling palm.


 III.

High birds soared high to hover;
 Thick leaves close clung to slip;
Wild rose and snowy clover
 Were warm for winds to dip,
And one ungentle lover,
 A bee with robber lip.


 IV.

Dart on, O buoyant swallow!
 Kiss leaves and willing rose!
Whose musk the sly winds follow,
 And bee that booming goes; - 
But in this quiet hollow
 I'll walk, which no one knows.


 V.

None save the moon that shineth
 At night through rifted trees;
The lonely flower that twineth
 Frail blooms that no one sees;
The whippoorwill that pineth;
 The sad, sweet-swaying breeze;


 VI.

The lone white stars that glitter;
 The stream's complaining wave;
Gray bats that dodge and flitter;
 Black crickets hid that rave;
And me whose life is bitter,
 And one white head stone grave.
