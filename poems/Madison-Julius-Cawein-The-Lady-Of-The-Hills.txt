 Though red my blood hath left its trail
 For five far miles, I shall not fail,
 As God in Heaven wills!
 The way was long through that black land.
 With sword on hip and horn in hand,
 At last before thy walls I stand,
 O Lady of the Hills!

 No seneschal shall put to scorn
 The summons of my bugle-horn!
 No man-at-arms shall stay!
 Yea! God hath helped my strength too far
 By bandit-caverned wood and scar
 To give it pause now, or to bar
 My all-avenging way.

 This hope still gives my body strength
 To kiss her eyes and lips at length
 Where all her kin can see;
 Then 'mid her towers of crime and gloom,
 Sin-haunted like the Halls of Doom,
 To smite her dead in that wild room
 Red-lit with revelry.

 Madly I rode; nor once did slack.
 Before my face the world rolled, black
 With nightmare wind and rain.
 Witch-lights mocked at me on the fen;
 And through the forest followed then
 Gaunt eyes of wolves; and ghosts of men
 Moaned by me on the plain.

 Still on I rode. My way was clear
 From that wild time when, spear to spear,
 Deep in the wind-torn wood,
 I met him!... Dead he lies beneath
 Their trysting oak. I clenched my teeth
 And rode. My wound scarce let me breathe,
 That filled my eyes with blood.

 And here I am. The blood may blind
 My eyesight now ... yet I shall find
 Her by some inner eye!
 For God, He hath this deed in care!
 Yea! I shall kiss again her hair,
 And tell her of her leman there,
 Then smite her dead, and die.
