 Argument Of The Nineteenth Book.


Achilles is reconciled to Agamemnon, and clothed in new armor forged by Vulcan, leads out the Myrmidons to battle.



 Now rose the morn in saffron vest attired
 From ocean, with new day for Gods and men,
 When Thetis at the fleet of Greece arrived,
 Bearing that gift divine. She found her son
 All tears, and close enfolding in his arms
 Patroclus, while his Myrmidons around
 Wept also;[1] she amid them, graceful, stood,
 And seizing fast his hand, him thus bespake.
 Although our loss be great, yet, oh my son!
 Leave we Patroclus lying on the bier
 To which the Gods ordain'd him from the first.
 Receive from Vulcan's hands these glorious arms,
 Such as no mortal shoulders ever bore.
 So saying, she placed the armor on the ground
 Before him, and the whole bright treasure rang.
 A tremor shook the Myrmidons; none dared
 Look on it, but all fled. Not so himself.
 In him fresh vengeance kindled at the view,
 And, while he gazed, a splendor as of fire
 Flash'd from his eyes. Delighted, in his hand
 He held the glorious bounty of the God,
 And, wondering at those strokes of art divine,
 His eager speech thus to his mother turn'd.[2]
 The God, my mother! hath bestow'd in truth
 Such armor on me as demanded skill
 Like his, surpassing far all power of man.
 Now, therefore, I will arm. But anxious fears
 Trouble me, lest intrusive flies, meantime,
 Breed worms within the spear-inflicted wounds
 Of Menoetiades, and fill with taint
 Of putrefaction his whole breathless form.[3]
 But him the silver-footed Goddess fair
 Thus answer'd. Oh, my son! chase from thy mind
 All such concern. I will, myself, essay
 To drive the noisome swarms which on the slain
 In battle feed voracious. Should he lie
 The year complete, his flesh shall yet be found
 Untainted, and, it may be, fragrant too.
 But thou the heroes of Achaia's host
 Convening, in their ears thy wrath renounce
 Against the King of men, then, instant, arm
 For battle, and put on thy glorious might.
 So saying, the Goddess raised his courage high.
 Then, through the nostrils of the dead she pour'd
 Ambrosia, and the ruddy juice divine
 Of nectar, antidotes against decay.
 And now forth went Achilles by the side
 Of ocean, calling with a dreadful shout
 To council all the heroes of the host.[4]
 Then, even they who in the fleet before
 Constant abode, helmsmen and those who held
 In stewardship the food and public stores,
 All flock'd to council, for that now at length
 After long abstinence from dread exploits
 Of war, Achilles had once more appear'd.
 Two went together, halting on the spear,
 (For still they felt the anguish of their wounds)
 Noble Ulysses and brave Diomede,
 And took an early seat; whom follow'd last
 The King of men, by Co�n in the field
 Of furious battle wounded with a lance.
 The Grecians all assembled, in the midst
 Upstood the swift Achilles, and began.
 Atrides! we had doubtless better sped
 Both thou and I, thus doing, when at first
 With cruel rage we burn'd, a girl the cause.
 I would that Dian's shaft had in the fleet
 Slain her that self-same day when I destroy'd
 Lyrnessus, and by conquest made her mine!
 Then had not many a Grecian, lifeless now,
 Clench'd with his teeth the ground, victim, alas!
 Of my revenge; whence triumph hath accrued
 To Hector and his host, while ours have cause
 For long remembrance of our mutual strife.
 But evils past let pass, yielding perforce
 To sad necessity. My wrath shall cease
 Now; I resign it; it hath burn'd too long.
 Thou therefore summon forth the host to fight,
 That I may learn meeting them in the field,
 If still the Trojans purpose at our fleet
 To watch us this night also. But I judge
 That driven by my spear to rapid flight,
 They shall escape with weary limbs[5] at least.
 He ended, and the Grecians brazen-greaved
 Rejoiced that Peleus' mighty son had cast
 His wrath aside. Then not into the midst
 Proceeding, but at his own seat, upstood
 King Agamemnon, and them thus bespake.
 Friends! Grecian heroes! Ministers of Mars!
 Arise who may to speak, he claims your ear;
 All interruption wrongs him, and distracts,
 Howe'er expert the speaker. Who can hear
 Amid the roar of tumult, or who speak?
 The clearest voice, best utterance, both are vain
 I shall address Achilles. Hear my speech
 Ye Argives, and with understanding mark.
 I hear not now the voice of your reproach[6]
 First; ye have oft condemn'd me. Yet the blame
 Rests not with me; Jove, Destiny, and she
 Who roams the shades, Erynnis, caused the offence.
 She fill'd my soul with fury on that day
 In council, when I seized Achilles' prize.
 For what could I? All things obey the Gods.
 Ate, pernicious Power, daughter of Jove,
 By whom all suffer, challenges from all
 Reverence and fear. Delicate are her feet
 Which scorn the ground, and over human heads
 She glides, injurious to the race of man,
 Of two who strive, at least entangling one.
 She injured, on a day, dread Jove himself
 Most excellent of all in earth or heaven,
 When Juno, although female, him deceived,
 What time Alcmena should have brought to light
 In bulwark'd Thebes the force of Hercules.
 Then Jove, among the gods glorying, spake.
 Hear all! both Gods and Goddesses, attend!
 That I may make my purpose known. This day
 Birth-pang-dispensing Ilithya brings
 An hero forth to light, who, sprung from those
 That sprang from me, his empire shall extend
 Over all kingdoms bordering on his own.
 To whom, designing fraud, Juno replied.
 Thou wilt be found false, and this word of thine
 Shall want performance. But Olympian Jove!
 Swear now the inviolable oath, that he
 Who shall, this day, fall from between the feet
 Of woman, drawing his descent from thee,
 Shall rule all kingdoms bordering on his own.
 She said, and Jove, suspecting nought her wiles,
 The great oath swore, to his own grief and wrong.
 At once from the Olympian summit flew
 Juno, and to Achaian Argos borne,
 There sought the noble wife[7] of Sthenelus,
 Offspring of Perseus. Pregnant with a son
 Six months, she now the seventh saw at hand,
 But him the Goddess premature produced,
 And check'd Alcmena's pangs already due.
 Then joyful to have so prevail'd, she bore
 Herself the tidings to Saturnian Jove.
 Lord of the candent lightnings! Sire of all!
 I bring thee tidings. The great prince, ordain'd
 To rule the Argive race, this day is born,
 Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, the son
 Of Perseus; therefore he derives from thee,
 Nor shall the throne of Argos shame his birth.
 She spake; then anguish stung the heart of Jove
 Deeply, and seizing by her glossy locks
 The Goddess Ate, in his wrath he swore
 That never to the starry skies again
 And the Olympian heights he would permit
 The universal mischief to return.
 Then, whirling her around, he cast her down
 To earth. She, mingling with all works of men,
 Caused many a pang to Jove, who saw his son
 Laborious tasks servile, and of his birth
 Unworthy, at Eurystheus' will enjoin'd.
 So when the hero Hector at our ships
 Slew us, I then regretted my offence
 Which Ate first impell'd me to commit.
 But since, infatuated by the Gods
 I err'd, behold me ready to appease
 With gifts of price immense whom I have wrong'd.
 Thou, then, arise to battle, and the host
 Rouse also. Not a promise yesternight
 Was made thee by Ulysses in thy tent
 On my behalf, but shall be well perform'd.
 Or if it please thee, though impatient, wait
 Short season, and my train shall bring the gifts
 Even now; that thou may'st understand and know
 That my peace-offerings are indeed sincere.
 To whom Achilles, swiftest of the swift.
 Atrides! Agamemnon! passing all
 In glory! King of men! recompense just
 By gifts to make me, or to make me none,
 That rests with thee. But let us to the fight
 Incontinent. It is no time to play
 The game of rhetoric, and to waste the hours
 In speeches. Much remains yet unperform'd.
 Achilles must go forth. He must be seen
 Once more in front of battle, wasting wide
 With brazen spear, the crowded ranks of Troy.
 Mark him--and as he fights, fight also ye.
 To whom Ulysses ever-wise replied.
 Nay--urge not, valiant as thou art thyself,
 Achaia's sons up to the battlements
 Of Ilium, by repast yet unrefresh'd,
 Godlike Achilles!--For when phalanx once
 Shall clash with phalanx, and the Gods with rage
 Both hosts inspire, the contest shall not then
 Prove short. Bid rather the Achaians take
 Both food and wine, for they are strength and might.
 To stand all day till sunset to a foe
 Opposed in battle, fasting, were a task
 Might foil the best; for though his will be prompt
 To combat, yet the power must by degrees
 Forsake him; thirst and hunger he must feel,
 And his limbs failing him at every step.
 But he who hath his vigor to the full
 Fed with due nourishment, although he fight
 All day, yet feels his courage unimpair'd,
 Nor weariness perceives till all retire.
 Come then--dismiss the people with command
 That each prepare replenishment. Meantime
 Let Agamemnon, King of men, his gifts
 In presence here of the assembled Greeks
 Produce, that all may view them, and that thou
 May'st feel thine own heart gladden'd at the sight.
 Let the King also, standing in the midst,
 Swear to thee, that he renders back the maid
 A virgin still, and strange to his embrace,
 And let thy own composure prove, the while,
 That thou art satisfied. Last, let him spread
 A princely banquet for thee in his tent,
 That thou may'st want no part of just amends.
 Thou too, Atrides, shalt hereafter prove
 More just to others; for himself, a King,
 Stoops not too low, soothing whom he hath wrong'd.
 Him Agamemnon answer'd, King of men.
 Thou hast arranged wisely the whole concern,
 O L�ertiades, and I have heard
 Thy speech, both words and method with delight.
 Willing I am, yea more, I wish to swear
 As thou hast said, for by the Gods I can
 Most truly. Let Achilles, though of pause
 Impatient, suffer yet a short delay
 With all assembled here, till from my tent
 The gifts arrive, and oaths of peace be sworn.
 To thee I give it in peculiar charge
 That choosing forth the most illustrious youths
 Of all Achaia, thou produce the gifts
 from my own ship, all those which yesternight
 We promised, nor the women leave behind.
 And let Talthybius throughout all the camp
 Of the Achaians, instant, seek a boar
 For sacrifice to Jove and to the Sun.
 Then thus Achilles matchless in the race.
 Atrides! most illustrious! King of men!
 Expedience bids us to these cares attend
 Hereafter, when some pause, perchance, of fight
 Shall happen, and the martial rage which fires
 My bosom now, shall somewhat less be felt.
 Our friends by Priameian Hector slain,
 Now strew the field mangled, for him hath Jove
 Exalted high, and given him great renown.
 But haste, now take refreshment; though, in truth
 Might I direct, the host should by all means
 Unfed to battle, and at set of sun
 All sup together, this affront revenged.
 But as for me, no drop shall pass my lips
 Or morsel, whose companion lies with feet
 Turn'd to the vestibule, pierced by the spear,
 And compass'd by my weeping train around.
 No want of food feel I. My wishes call
 For carnage, blood, and agonies and groans.
 But him, excelling in all wisdom, thus
 Ulysses answer'd. Oh Achilles! son
 Of Peleus! bravest far of all our host!
 Me, in no scanty measure, thou excell'st
 Wielding the spear, and thee in prudence, I
 Not less. For I am elder, and have learn'd
 What thou hast yet to learn. Bid then thine heart
 Endure with patience to be taught by me.
 Men, satiate soon with battle, loathe the field
 On which the most abundant harvest falls,
 Reap'd by the sword; and when the hand of Jove
 Dispenser of the great events of war,
 Turns once the scale, then, farewell every hope
 Of more than scanty gleanings. Shall the Greeks
 Abstain from sustenance for all who die?
 That were indeed severe, since day by day
 No few expire, and respite could be none.
 The dead, die whoso may, should be inhumed.
 This, duty bids, but bids us also deem
 One day sufficient for our sighs and tears.
 Ourselves, all we who still survive the war,
 Have need of sustenance, that we may bear
 The lengthen'd conflict with recruited might,
 Case in enduring brass.--Ye all have heard
 Your call to battle; let none lingering stand
 In expectation of a farther call,
 Which if it sound, shall thunder prove to him
 Who lurks among the ships. No. Rush we all
 Together forth, for contest sharp prepared,
 And persevering with the host of Troy.
 So saying, the sons of Nestor, glorious Chief,
 He chose, with Meges Phyleus' noble son,
 Thoas, Meriones, and Melanippus
 And Lycomedes. These, together, sought
 The tent of Agamemnon, King of men.
 They ask'd, and they received. Soon they produced
 The seven promised tripods from the tent,
 Twice ten bright caldrons, twelve high-mettled steeds,
 Seven lovely captives skill'd alike in arts
 Domestic, of unblemish'd beauty rare,
 And last, Bris�is with the blooming cheeks.
 Before them went Ulysses, bearing weigh'd
 Ten golden talents, whom the chosen Greeks
 Attended laden with the remnant gifts.
 Full in the midst they placed them. Then arose
 King Agamemnon, and Talthybius
 The herald, clear in utterance as a God,
 Beside him stood, holding the victim boar.
 Atrides, drawing forth his dagger bright,
 Appendant ever to his sword's huge sheath,
 Sever'd the bristly forelock of the boar,
 A previous offering. Next, with lifted hands
 To Jove he pray'd, while, all around, the Greeks
 Sat listening silent to the Sovereign's voice.
 He look'd to the wide heaven, and thus he pray'd.
 First, Jove be witness! of all Powers above
 Best and supreme; Earth next, and next the Sun!
 And last, who under Earth the guilt avenge
 Of oaths sworn falsely, let the Furies hear!
 For no respect of amorous desire
 Or other purpose, have I laid mine hand
 On fair Bris�is, but within my tent
 Untouch'd, immaculate she hath remain'd.
 And if I falsely swear, then may the Gods
 The many woes with which they mark the crime
 Of men forsworn, pour also down on me!
 So saying, he pierced the victim in his throat
 And, whirling him around, Talthybius, next,
 Cast him into the ocean, fishes' food.[8]
 Then, in the centre of Achaia's sons
 Uprose Achilles, and thus spake again.
 Jove! Father! dire calamities, effects
 Of thy appointment, fall on human-kind.
 Never had Agamemnon in my breast
 Such anger kindled, never had he seized,
 Blinded by wrath, and torn my prize away,
 But that the slaughter of our numerous friends
 Which thence ensued, thou hadst, thyself, ordained.
 Now go, ye Grecians, eat, and then to battle.
 So saying, Achilles suddenly dissolved
 The hasty council, and all flew dispersed
 To their own ships. Then took the Myrmidons
 Those splendid gifts which in the tent they lodged
 Of swift Achilles, and the damsels led
 Each to a seat, while others of his train
 Drove forth the steeds to pasture with his herd.
 But when Bris�is, bright as Venus, saw
 Patroclus lying mangled by the spear,
 Enfolding him around, she shriek'd and tore
 Her bosom, her smooth neck and beauteous cheeks.
 Then thus, divinely fair, with tears she said.
 Ah, my Patroclus! dearest friend of all
 To hapless me, departing from this tent
 I left thee living, and now, generous Chief!
 Restored to it again, here find thee dead.
 How rapid in succession are my woes!
 I saw, myself, the valiant prince to whom
 My parents had betroth'd me, slain before
 Our city walls; and my three brothers, sons
 Of my own mother, whom with long regret
 I mourn, fell also in that dreadful field.
 But when the swift Achilles slew the prince
 Design'd my spouse, and the fair city sack'd
 Of noble Mynes, thou by every art
 Of tender friendship didst forbid my tears,
 Promising oft that thou would'st make me bride
 Of Peleus' godlike son, that thy own ship
 Should waft me hence to Phthia, and that thyself
 Would'st furnish forth among the Myrmidons
 Our nuptial feast. Therefore thy death I mourn
 Ceaseless, for thou wast ever kind to me.
 She spake, and all her fellow-captives heaved
 Responsive sighs, deploring each, in show,
 The dead Patroclus, but, in truth, herself.[9]
 Then the Achaian Chiefs gather'd around
 Achilles, wooing him to eat, but he
 Groan'd and still resolute, their suit refused--
 If I have here a friend on whom by prayers
 I may prevail, I pray that ye desist,
 Nor longer press me, mourner as I am,
 To eat or drink, for till the sun go down
 I am inflexible, and will abstain.
 So saying, the other princes he dismiss'd
 Impatient, but the sons of Atreus both,
 Ulysses, Nestor and Idomeneus,
 With Phoenix, hoary warrior, in his tent
 Abiding still, with cheerful converse kind
 Essay'd to soothe him, whose afflicted soul
 All soothing scorn'd till he should once again
 Rush on the ravening edge of bloody war.
 Then, mindful of his friend, groaning he said
 Time was, unhappiest, dearest of my friends!
 When even thou, with diligent dispatch,
 Thyself, hast spread a table in my tent,
 The hour of battle drawing nigh between
 The Greeks and warlike Trojans. But there lies
 Thy body now, gored by the ruthless steel,
 And for thy sake I neither eat nor drink,
 Though dearth be none, conscious that other wo
 Surpassing this I can have none to fear.
 No, not if tidings of my father's death
 Should reach me, who, this moment, weeps, perhaps,
 In Phthia tears of tenderest regret
 For such a son; while I, remote from home
 Fight for detested Helen under Troy.
 Nor even were he dead, whom, if he live,
 I rear in Scyros, my own darling son,
 My Neoptolemus of form divine.[10]
 For still this hope I cherish'd in my breast
 Till now, that, of us two, myself alone
 Should fall at Ilium, and that thou, restored
 To Phthia, should'st have wafted o'er the waves
 My son from Scyros to his native home,
 That thou might'st show him all his heritage,
 My train of menials, and my fair abode.
 For either dead already I account
 Peleus, or doubt not that his residue
 Of miserable life shall soon be spent,
 Through stress of age and expectation sad
 That tidings of my death shall, next, arrive.
 So spake Achilles weeping, around whom
 The Chiefs all sigh'd, each with remembrance pain'd
 Of some loved object left at home. Meantime
 Jove, with compassion moved, their sorrow saw,
 And in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake.
 Daughter! thou hast abandon'd, as it seems,
 Yon virtuous Chief for ever; shall no care
 Thy mind engage of brave Achilles more?
 Before his gallant fleet mourning he sits
 His friend, disconsolate; the other Greeks
 Sat and are satisfied; he only fasts.
 Go then--instil nectar into his breast,
 And sweets ambrosial, that he hunger not.
 So saying, he urged Minerva prompt before.
 In form a shrill-voiced Harpy of long wing
 Through ether down she darted, while the Greeks
 In all their camp for instant battle arm'd.
 Ambrosial sweets and nectar she instill'd
 Into his breast, lest he should suffer loss
 Of strength through abstinence, then soar'd again
 To her great Sire's unperishing abode.
 And now the Grecians from their gallant fleet
 All pour'd themselves abroad. As when thick snow
 From Jove descends, driven by impetuous gusts
 Of the cloud-scattering North, so frequent shone
 Issuing from the fleet the dazzling casques,
 Boss'd bucklers, hauberks strong, and ashen spears.
 Upwent the flash to heaven; wide all around
 The champain laugh'd with beamy brass illumed,
 And tramplings of the warriors on all sides
 Resounded, amidst whom Achilles arm'd.
 He gnash'd his teeth, fire glimmer'd in his eyes,
 Anguish intolerable wrung his heart
 And fury against Troy, while he put on
 His glorious arms, the labor of a God.
 First, to his legs his polish'd greaves he clasp'd
 Studded with silver, then his corselet bright
 Braced to his bosom, his huge sword of brass
 Athwart his shoulder slung, and his broad shield
 Uplifted last, luminous as the moon.
 Such as to mariners a fire appears,
 Kindled by shepherds on the distant top
 Of some lone hill; they, driven by stormy winds,
 Reluctant roam far off the fishy deep,
 Such from Achilles' burning shield divine
 A lustre struck the skies; his ponderous helm
 He lifted to his brows; starlike it shone,
 And shook its curling crest of bushy gold,
 By Vulcan taught to wave profuse around.
 So clad, godlike Achilles trial made
 If his arms fitted him, and gave free scope
 To his proportion'd limbs; buoyant they proved
 As wings, and high upbore his airy tread.
 He drew his father's spear forth from his case,
 Heavy and huge and long. That spear, of all
 Achaia's sons, none else had power to wield;
 Achilles only could the Pelian spear
 Brandish, by Chiron for his father hewn
 From Pelion's top for slaughter of the brave.
 His coursers, then, Automedon prepared
 And Alcimus, adjusting diligent
 The fair caparisons; they thrust the bits
 Into their mouths, and to the chariot seat
 Extended and made fast the reins behind.
 The splendid scourge commodious to the grasp
 Seizing, at once Automedon upsprang
 Into his place; behind him, arm'd complete
 Achilles mounted, as the orient sun
 All dazzling, and with awful tone his speech
 Directed to the coursers of his Sire.
 Xanthus, and Balius of Podarges' blood
 Illustrious! see ye that, the battle done,
 Ye bring whom now ye bear back to the host
 Of the Achaians in far other sort,
 Nor leave him, as ye left Patroclus, dead.[11]
 Him then his steed unconquer'd in the race,
 Xanthus answer'd from beneath his yoke,
 But, hanging low his head, and with his mane
 Dishevell'd all, and streaming to the ground.
 Him Juno vocal made, Goddess white-arm'd.
 And doubtless so we will. This day at least
 We bear thee safe from battle, stormy Chief!
 But thee the hour of thy destruction swift
 Approaches, hasten'd by no fault of ours,
 But by the force of fate and power divine.
 For not through sloth or tardiness on us
 Aught chargeable, have Ilium's sons thine arms
 Stript from Patroclus' shoulders, but a God
 Matchless in battle, offspring of bright-hair'd
 Latona, him contending in the van
 Slew, for the glory of the Chief of Troy.
 We, Zephyrus himself, though by report
 Swiftest of all the winds of heaven, in speed
 Could equal, but the Fates thee also doom
 By human hands to fall, and hands divine.
 The interposing Furies at that word
 Suppress'd his utterance,[12] and indignant, thus,
 Achilles, swiftest of the swift, replied.
 Why, Xanthus, propheciest thou my death?
 It ill beseems thee. I already know
 That from my parents far remote my doom
 Appoints me here to die; yet not the more
 Cease I from feats if arms, till Ilium's host
 Shall have received, at length, their fill of war.
 He said, and with a shout drove forth to battle.
