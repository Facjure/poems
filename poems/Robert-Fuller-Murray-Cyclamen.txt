I had a plant which would not thrive,
 Although I watered it with care,
 I could not save the blossoms fair,
Nor even keep the leaves alive.

I strove till it was vain to strive.
 I gave it light, I gave it air,
 I sought from skill and counsel rare
The means to make it yet survive.

A lady sent it me, to prove
 She held my friendship in esteem;
I would not have it as she said,
I wanted it to be for love;
 And now not even friends we seem,
And now the cyclamen is dead.
