Crinkled oak-leaves, twinkling in the sun,
Splashed by midday showers, dripping cold - 
Serrate oak-leaves, silvered by the sun
That has brushed yon dull brown grass with gold.

Green and crinkled oak leaves, tremble now - 
Strong you would be, strong would be and bold,
Ah! green oak-leaves, you are trembling now - 
By the saucy wind deceived - cajoled!

Trembling oak leaves - you are soon to fall,
Soon to hide the earth with yellowing mould
Twinkling, crinkling oak-leaves, soon you'll fall
For the autumn sun is shining cold.
