News!
What is the word that they tell now, now, now!
The little drums beating in the bazaars?
They beat (among, the buyers and the sellers)
�Nimrud, ah, Nimrud!
God tends a gnat against Nimrud!�
Watchers, O Watchers a thousand!

News!
At the edge of the crops, now, now, where the well-wheels are halted,
One prepares to loose the bullocks and one scrapes his hoe,
They beat (among the Bowers and the reapers)
�Nimrud, ah, Nimrud!
God prepares an ill day far Nimrud!�
Watchers, O Watchers ten thousand.

News!
By the fires of the camps, now, now, where the travellers meet,
Where the camels come in and the horses: their men conferring,
They beat (among the packmen and the drivers)
�Nimrud, ah, Nimrud!
Thus it befell last noon to Nimrud!�
Watchers, O Watchers an hundred thousand!

News!
Under the shadow of the border-peels, now, now, now!
In the rocks of the passes where the expectant shoe their horses,
They beat (among the rifles and the riders)
�Nimrud, ah, Nimrud!
Shall we go up against Nimrud?�
Watchers, O Watchers a thousand thousand!

News!
Bring out the heaps of grain, open the account-books again!
Drive forward the well-bullocks against the taxable harvest!
Eat and lie under the trees, pitch the police-guarded fair-grounds, O dancers!
Hide away the rifles and let down the ladders from the watch-towers!
They beat (among all the peoples)
�Now, now, now!
God has reserved the Sword for Nimrud!
God has given Victory to Nimrud!
Let us abide under Nimrud!�
O Well-disposed and Heedful, an hundred thousand thousand
