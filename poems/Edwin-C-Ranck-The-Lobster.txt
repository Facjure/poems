 Lobsters haven't any feet,
But they have lots of claws;
 Yet lobster meat is good to eat,
And this is strange, because--
 A dog is never good to eat,
And yet a dog has paws,
 And so have cats, and so have rats
And so have other kind of brats.

 A lobster then, so to speak,
Is, my child, an awful freak;
 For if you get him in a stew,
He'll blush quite red and glare at you.
 Yet if you eat much lobster salad,
It will make you very pallid.
