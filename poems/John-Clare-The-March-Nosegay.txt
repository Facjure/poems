title: The March Nosegay
---

 The bonny March morning is beaming
 In mingled crimson and grey,
 White clouds are streaking and creaming
 The sky till the noon of the day;
 The fir deal looks darker and greener,
 And grass hills below look the same;
 The air all about is serener,
 The birds less familiar and tame.

 Here's two or three flowers for my fair one,
 Wood primroses and celandine too;
 I oft look about for a rare one
 To put in a posy for you.
 The birds look so clean and so neat,
 Though there's scarcely a leaf on the grove;
 The sun shines about me so sweet,
 I cannot help thinking of love.

 So where the blue violets are peeping,
 By the warm sunny sides of the woods,
 And the primrose, 'neath early morn weeping,
 Amid a large cluster of buds,
 (The morning it was such a rare one,
 So dewy, so sunny, and fair,)
 I sought the wild flowers for my fair one,
 To wreath in her glossy black hair.
