They lift their faces to the light,
 And aye they are a gallant band;
The queen of all is snowy white - 
 A stately thing, and tall and grand.

See, close beside, in yellow drest,
 Is the prince consort of the hour;
A bit of God's own sunshine prest
 Into a glorious golden flower!

And mark the courtiers' noble grace - 
 Gay courtiers these, in raiment fine - 
Their satin doublets slashed with lace,
 Their velvet cloaks as red as wine.

Each maid-in-waiting is most fair - 
 Note well the graces she unfurls - 
The winds have tossed her fluffy hair,
 And left it in a thousand curls.

And yonder quaint, old-fashioned one,
 Arrayed in palest lavender,
Ah! few there are, when all is done,
 In beauty can compare with her.

The pink - I've seen at eventide
 A something very like to this,
A cloud adrift upon the sky,
 All rosy from the sun's last kiss.

Without the court, the chill and gloom
 Of autumn twilight o'er the land;
Within, the grandeur and the bloom
 Of queen, of prince, and courtiers grand.
