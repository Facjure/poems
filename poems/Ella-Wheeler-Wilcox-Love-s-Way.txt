title: Love's Way
---

Love gives us copious potions of delight,
 Of pain and ecstasy, and peace and care;
Love leads us upward, to the mountain height,
 And, like an angel, stands beside us there;
Then thrusts us, demon-like, in some abyss:
 Where, in the darkness of despair, we grope,
Till, suddenly, Love greets us with a kiss
 And guides us back to flowery fields of hope.

Love makes all wisdom seem but poorest folly,
 And yet the simplest mind with Love grows wise,
The gayest heart he teaches melancholy,
 Yet glorifies the erstwhile brooding eyes.
Love lives on change, and yet at change Love mocks,
 For Love's whole life is one great paradox.
