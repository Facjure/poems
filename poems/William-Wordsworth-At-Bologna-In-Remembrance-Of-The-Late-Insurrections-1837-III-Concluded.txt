title: At Bologna, In Remembrance Of The Late Insurrections, 1837 - III - Concluded

 As leaves are to the tree whereon they grow
 And wither, every human generation
 Is, to the Being of a mighty nation,
 Locked in our world's embrace through weal and woe;
 Thought that should teach the zealot to forego
 Rash schemes, to abjure all selfish agitation,
 And seek through noiseless pains and moderation
 The unblemished good they only can bestow.
 Alas! with most, who weigh futurity
 Against time present, passion holds the scales:
 Hence equal ignorance of both prevails,
 And nations sink; or, struggling to be free,
 Are doomed to flounder on, like wounded whales
 Tossed on the bosom of a stormy sea.
