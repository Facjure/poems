Close the book and dim the light,
I shall read no more to-night.
No - I am not sleepy, dear - 
Do not go: sit by me here
In the darkness and the deep
Silence of the watch I keep.
Something in your presence so
Soothes me - as in long ago
I first felt your hand - as now - 
In the darkness touch my brow;
I've no other wish than you
Thus should fold mine eyelids to,
Saying nought of sigh or tear - 
Just as God were sitting here.
