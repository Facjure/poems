A prayer of love, O Father!
 A fair and flowery way
Life stretches out before these
 On this their marriage day.
O pour Thy choicest blessing,
 Withhold no gift of Thine,
Fill all their world with beauty
 And tenderness divine!

A prayer of love, O Father!
 This holy love and pure,
That thrills the soul to rapture,
 O may it e'er endure!
The richest of earth's treasures,
 The gold without alloy,
The flower of faith unfading,
 The full, the perfect joy!

No mist of tears or doubting,
 But in their steadfast eyes
The light divine, the light of love,
 The light of Paradise.
A prayer of love, O Father!
 A prayer of love to Thee,
God's best be theirs for life, for death,
 And all Eternity!
