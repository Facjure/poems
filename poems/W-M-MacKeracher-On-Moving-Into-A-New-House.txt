title: On Moving Into A New House.
---

Heaven bless this new abode; defend its doors
 Against the entry of malignant sprites -
 Gaunt Poverty, pale Sickness, Care that blights;
And o'er its thresholds, like the enchanted shores
Of faery isles, serene amid the roars
 Of baffled seas, let in all fair delights
 (Such as make happy days and restful nights)
To tread familiarly its charmï¿½d floors.

Within its walls let moderate Plenty reign,
 And gracious Industry, and cheerful Health:
 Plenish its chambers with Contentment's wealth,
Nor let high Joy its humble roof disdain;
 Here let us make renewal of Love's lease,
 And dwell with Piety, who dwells with Peace.
