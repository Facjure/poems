Sheldrake, a magician
 - the mandrake
a mythic plant whose shriek
drove listeners wild....
this lake, Sheldrake
and its windsong-heartswoon
counterpart, Skootematta
with Shabomeka &amp;
a whiff of Buckshot Lake to boot,
waves lapping the
prayerful stones - 
water's edge
the earth's bones....
Lakes an art-form
hardscrabble scribble
shorthand on a blessed land.

The mysticism of basic shadows,
occult shapes of ourselves.
