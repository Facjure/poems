Now the shiades o� the elems da stratch muore an muore,
Vrom the low-zink�n zun in the west o� the sky;
An� the m�idens da stan out in clusters avore
The doors, var to chatty an� zee vo�ke goo by.

An� ther cuombs be a-zet in ther bunches o� hiair,
An� ther curdles1 da hang roun� ther necks lily-white,
An� ther che�aks tha be ruosy, ther shoulders be biare,
Ther looks tha be merry, ther lims tha be light.

An� the times have a been but tha c�ant be noo muore
When I, too, had my j�y under evemen�s dim sky,
When my Fanny did stan� out wi� others avore
Her door, var to chatty an� zee vo�ke goo by.

An� up there, in the green, is her own honey-zuck,
That her brother tr�in�d up roun� her winder; an� there
Is the ruose an� the jessamy, where she did pluck
A flow�r var her buzom ar bud var her hiair.

An� zoo smile, happy m�idens! var every fiace,
As the zummers da come an� the years da roll by,
Wull soon sadden, ar goo vur awoy vrom the pliace,
Ar else, lik� my Fanny, wull wither an� die.

But when you be a-lost vrom the parish, some muore
Wull come on in y�ur pliazen to bloom an� to die;
An� zoo zummer wull always have m�idens avore
Ther doors, var to chatty an� zee vo�ke goo by.

Var d�a�ters ha� marnen when mothers ha� night,
An� there�s beauty alive when the fiairest is dead;
As when oon sparkl�n wiave da zink down vrom the light,
Another da come up an� catch it instead.

Zoo smile on, happy m�idens! but I shall noo muore
Zee the m�id I da miss under evemen�s dim sky;
An� my heart is a-touch�d to zee you out avore
The doors, var to chatty and zee vo�ke goo by.
