 What is the secret of your life, browsing ox,
 Ox the sweet grass eating?
 Who strung the mighty sinews in your flesh?
 Who set that great heart beating?

 What is the secret of your death, soulless ox,
 Ox so patiently waiting?
 Why hath pain wove her net for your brain�s anguish
 If for you Death will gain no life�s creating?
