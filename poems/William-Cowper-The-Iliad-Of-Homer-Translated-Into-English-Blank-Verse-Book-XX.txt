 Argument Of The Twentieth Book.


By permission of Jupiter the Gods descend into the battle, and range themselves on either side respectively. Neptune rescues �neas from death by the hand of Achilles, from whom Apollo, soon after, rescues Hector. Achilles slays many Trojans.



 The Grecians, thus, before their lofty ships
 Stood arm'd around Achilles, glorious Chief
 Insatiable with war, and opposite
 The Trojans on the rising-ground appear'd.[1]
 Meantime, Jove order'd Themis, from the head
 Of the deep-fork'd Olympian to convene
 The Gods in council. She to every part
 Proceeding, bade them to the courts of Jove.[2]
 Nor of the Floods was any absent thence
 Oceanus except, or of the Nymphs
 Who haunt the pleasant groves, or dwell beside
 Stream-feeding fountains, or in meadows green.
 Within the courts of cloud-assembler Jove
 Arrived, on pillar'd thrones radiant they sat,
 With ingenuity divine contrived
 By Vulcan for the mighty Sire of all.
 Thus they within the Thunderer's palace sat
 Assembled; nor was Neptune slow to hear
 The voice of Themis, but (the billows left)
 Came also; in the midst his seat he took,
 And ask'd, incontinent, the mind of Jove.[3]
 King of the lightnings! wherefore hast thou call'd
 The Gods to council? Hast thou aught at heart
 Important to the hosts of Greece and Troy?
 For on the battle's fiery edge they stand.
 To whom replied Jove, Sovereign of the storms,
 Thou know'st my council, Shaker of the shores!
 And wherefore ye are call'd. Although ordain'd
 So soon to die, they interest me still.
 Myself, here seated on Olympus' top,
 With contemplation will my mind indulge
 Of yon great spectacle; but ye, the rest,
 Descend into the field, Trojan or Greek
 Each to assist, as each shall most incline.
 For should Achilles in the field no foe
 Find save the Trojans, quickly should they fly
 Before the rapid force of Peleus' son.
 They trembled ever at his look, and since
 Such fury for his friend hath fired his heart,
 I fear lest he anticipate the will
 Of Fate, and Ilium perish premature.
 So spake the son of Saturn kindling war
 Inevitable, and the Gods to fight
 'Gan move with minds discordant. Juno sought
 And Pallas, with the earth-encircling Power
 Neptune, the Grecian fleet, with whom were join'd
 Mercury, teacher of all useful arts,
 And Vulcan, rolling on all sides his eyes
 Tremendous, but on disproportion'd legs,
 Not without labor hard, halting uncouth.
 Mars, warrior-God, on Ilium's part appear'd
 With Phoebus never-shorn, Dian shaft-arm'd,
 Xanthus, Latona, and the Queen of smiles,
 Venus. So long as the immortal Gods
 Mixed not with either host, Achaia's sons
 Exulted, seeing, after tedious pause,
 Achilles in the field, and terror shook
 The knees of every Trojan, at the sight
 Of swift Achilles like another Mars
 Panting for blood, and bright in arms again.
 But when the Olympian Powers had enter'd once
 The multitude, then Discord, at whose voice
 The million maddens, vehement arose;
 Then, Pallas at the trench without the wall
 By turns stood shouting, and by turns a shout
 Sent terrible along the sounding shore,
 While, gloomy as a tempest, opposite,
 Mars from the lofty citadel of Troy
 Now yell'd aloud, now running o'er the hill
 Callicolone, on the Simois' side.
 Thus the Immortals, ever-blest, impell'd
 Both hosts to battle, and dire inroad caused
 Of strife among them. Sudden from on high
 The Sire of Gods and men thunder'd; meantime,
 Neptune the earth and the high mountains shook;
 Through all her base and to her topmost peak
 Ida spring-fed the agitation felt
 Reeling, all Ilium and the fleet of Greece.
 Upstarted from his throne, appall'd, the King
 Of Erebus, and with a cry his fears
 Through hell proclaim'd, lest Neptune, o'er his head
 Shattering the vaulted earth, should wide disclose
 To mortal and immortal eyes his realm
 Terrible, squalid, to the Gods themselves
 A dreaded spectacle; with such a sound
 The Powers eternal into battle rush'd.[4]
 Opposed to Neptune, King of the vast Deep,
 Apollo stood with his wing'd arrows arm'd;
 Pallas to Mars; Diana shaft-expert,
 Sister of Phoebus, in her golden bow
 Rejoicing, with whose shouts the forests ring
 To Juno; Mercury, for useful arts
 Famed, to Latona; and to Vulcan's force
 The eddied River broad by mortal men
 Scamander call'd, but Xanthus by the Gods.
 So Gods encounter'd Gods. But most desire
 Achilles felt, breaking the ranks, to rush
 On Priameian Hector, with whose blood
 Chiefly his fury prompted him to sate
 The indefatigable God of war.
 But, the encourager of Ilium's host
 Apollo, urged �neas to assail
 The son of Peleus, with heroic might
 Inspiring his bold heart. He feign'd the voice
 Of Priam's son Lycaon, and his form
 Assuming, thus the Trojan Chief address'd.
 �neas! Trojan leader! where are now
 Thy vaunts, which, banqueting erewhile among
 Our princes, o'er thy brimming cups thou mad'st,
 That thou would'st fight, thyself, with Peleus' son?
 To whom �neas answer thus returned.
 Offspring of Priam! why enjoin'st thou me
 Not so inclined, that arduous task, to cope
 With the unmatch'd Achilles? I have proved
 His force already, when he chased me down
 From Ida with his spear, what time he made
 Seizure of all our cattle, and destroy'd
 Pedasus and Lyrnessus; but I 'scaped
 Unslain, by Jove himself empower'd to fly,
 Else had I fallen by Achilles' hand,
 And by the hand of Pallas, who his steps
 Conducted, and exhorted him to slay
 Us and the Leleges.[5] Vain, therefore, proves
 All mortal force to Peleus' son opposed;
 For one, at least, of the Immortals stands
 Ever beside him, guardian of his life,
 And, of himself, he hath an arm that sends
 His rapid spear unerring to the mark.
 Yet, would the Gods more equal sway the scales
 Of battle, not with ease should he subdue
 Me, though he boast a panoply of brass.
 Him, then, Apollo answer'd, son of Jove.
 Hero! prefer to the immortal Gods
 Thy Prayer, for thee men rumor Venus' son
 Daughter of Jove; and Peleus' son his birth
 Drew from a Goddess of inferior note.
 Thy mother is from Jove; the offspring, his,
 Less noble of the hoary Ocean old.
 Go, therefore, and thy conquering spear uplift
 Against him, nor let aught his sounding words
 Appal thee, or his threats turn thee away.
 So saying, with martial force the Chief he fill'd,
 Who through the foremost combatants advanced
 Radiant in arms. Nor pass'd Anchises' son
 Unseen of Juno, through the crowded ranks
 Seeking Achilles, but the Powers of heaven
 Convened by her command, she thus address'd.
 Neptune, and thou, Minerva! with mature
 Deliberation, ponder the event.
 Yon Chief, �neas, dazzling bright in arms;
 Goes to withstand Achilles, and he goes
 Sent by Apollo; in despite of whom
 Be it our task to give him quick repulse,
 Or, of ourselves, let some propitious Power
 Strengthen Achilles with a mind exempt
 From terror, and with force invincible.
 So shall he know that of the Gods above
 The mightiest are his friends, with whom compared
 The favorers of Ilium in time past,
 Who stood her guardians in the bloody strife,
 Are empty boasters all, and nothing worth.
 For therefore came we down, that we may share
 This fight, and that Achilles suffer nought
 Fatal to-day, though suffer all he must
 Hereafter, with his thread of life entwined
 By Destiny, the day when he was born.
 But should Achilles unapprized remain
 Of such advantage by a voice divine,
 When he shall meet some Deity in the field,
 Fear then will seize him, for celestial forms
 Unveil'd are terrible to mortal eyes.
 To whom replied the Shaker of the shores.
 Juno! thy hot impatience needs control;
 It ill befits thee. No desire I feel
 To force into contention with ourselves
 Gods, our inferiors. No. Let us, retired
 To yonder hill, distant from all resort,
 There sit, while these the battle wage alone.
 But if Apollo, or if Mars the fight
 Entering, begin, themselves, to interfere
 Against Achilles, then will we at once
 To battle also; and, I much misdeem,
 Or glad they shall be soon to mix again
 Among the Gods on the Olympian heights,
 By strong coercion of our arms subdued.
 So saying, the God of Ocean azure-hair'd
 Moved foremost to the lofty mound earth-built
 Of noble Hercules, by Pallas raised
 And by the Trojans for his safe escape,
 What time the monster of the deep pursued
 The hero from the sea-bank o'er the plain.
 There Neptune sat, and his confederate Gods,
 Their shoulders with impenetrable clouds
 O'ermantled, while the city-spoiler Mars
 Sat with Apollo opposite on the hill
 Callicolone, with their aids divine.
 So, Gods to Gods in opposite aspect
 Sat ruminating, and alike the work
 All fearing to begin of arduous war,
 While from his seat sublime Jove urged them on.
 The champain all was fill'd, and with the blaze
 Illumined wide of men and steeds brass-arm'd,
 And the incumber'd earth jarr'd under foot
 Of the encountering hosts. Then, two, the rest
 Surpassing far, into the midst advanced
 Impatient for the fight, Anchises' son
 �neas and Achilles, glorious Chief!
 �neas first, under his ponderous casque
 Nodding and menacing, advanced; before
 His breast he held the well-conducted orb
 Of his broad shield, and shook his brazen spear.
 On the other side, Achilles to the fight
 Flew like a ravening lion, on whose death
 Resolved, the peasants from all quarters meet;
 He, viewing with disdain the foremost, stalks
 Right on, but smitten by some dauntless youth
 Writhes himself, and discloses his huge fangs
 Hung with white foam; then, growling for revenge,
 Lashes himself to battle with his tail,
 Till with a burning eye and a bold heart
 He springs to slaughter, or himself is slain;
 So, by his valor and his noble mind
 Impell'd, renown'd Achilles moved toward
 �neas, and, small interval between,
 Thus spake the hero matchless in the race.
 Why stand'st thou here, �neas! thy own band
 Left at such distance? Is it that thine heart
 Glows with ambition to contend with me
 In hope of Priam's honors, and to fill
 His throne hereafter in Troy steed-renown'd?
 But shouldst thou slay me, not for that exploit
 Would Priam such large recompense bestow,
 For he hath sons, and hath, beside, a mind
 And disposition not so lightly changed.
 Or have the Trojans of their richest soil
 For vineyard apt or plow assign'd thee part
 If thou shalt slay me? Difficult, I hope,
 At least, thou shalt experience that emprize.
 For, as I think, I have already chased
 Thee with my spear. Forgettest thou the day
 When, finding thee alone, I drove thee down
 Headlong from Ida, and, thy cattle left
 Afar, thou didst not dare in all thy flight
 Turn once, till at Lyrnessus safe arrived,
 Which city by Jove's aid and by the aid
 Of Pallas I destroy'd, and captive led
 Their women? Thee, indeed, the Gods preserved
 But they shall not preserve thee, as thou dream'st
 Now also. Back into thy host again;
 Hence, I command thee, nor oppose in fight
 My force, lest evil find thee. To be taught
 By suffering only is the part of fools.
 To whom �neas answer thus return'd.
 Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,
 With words to scare me. I have also taunts
 At my command, and could be sharp as thou.
 By such reports as from the lips of men
 We oft have heard, each other's birth we know
 And parents; but my parents to behold
 Was ne'er thy lot, nor have I thine beheld.
 Thee men proclaim from noble Peleus sprung
 And Thetis, bright hair'd Goddess of the Deep;
 I boast myself of lovely Venus born
 To brave Anchises; and his son this day
 In battle slain thy sire shall mourn, or mine;
 For I expect not that we shall depart
 Like children, satisfied with words alone.
 But if it please thee more at large to learn
 My lineage (thousands can attest it true)
 Know this. Jove, Sovereign of the storms, begat
 Dardanus, and ere yet the sacred walls
 Of Ilium rose, the glory of this plain,
 He built Dardania; for at Ida's foot
 Dwelt our progenitors in ancient days.
 Dardanus was the father of a son,
 King Ericthonius, wealthiest of mankind.
 Three thousand mares of his the marish grazed,
 Each suckling with delight her tender foal.
 Boreas, enamor'd of no few of these,
 The pasture sought, and cover'd them in form
 Of a steed azure-maned. They, pregnant thence,
 Twelve foals produced, and all so light of foot,
 That when they wanton'd in the fruitful field
 They swept, and snapp'd it not, the golden ear;
 And when they wanton'd on the boundless deep,
 They skimm'd the green wave's frothy ridge, secure.
 From Ericthonius sprang Tros, King of Troy,
 And Tros was father of three famous sons,
 Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede
 Loveliest of human kind, whom for his charms
 The Gods caught up to heaven, there to abide
 With the immortals, cup-bearer of Jove.
 Ilus begat Laomedon, and he
 Five sons, Tithonus, Priam, Clytius,
 Lampus, and Hicetaon, branch of Mars.
 Assaracus a son begat, by name
 Capys, and Capys in due time his son
 Warlike Anchises, and Anchises me.
 But Priam is the noble Hector's sire.[6]
 Such is my lineage, and such blood I boast;
 But valor is from Jove; he, as he wills,
 Increases or reduces it in man,
 For he is lord of all. Therefore enough--
 Too long like children we have stood, the time
 Consuming here, while battle roars around.
 Reproach is cheap. Easily might we cast
 Gibes at each other, till a ship that asks
 A hundred oars should sink beneath the load.
 The tongue of man is voluble, hath words
 For every theme, nor wants wide field and long,
 And as he speaks so shall he hear again.
 But we--why should we wrangle, and with taunts
 Assail each other, as the practice is
 Of women, who with heart-devouring strife
 On fire, start forth into the public way
 To mock each other, uttering, as may chance,
 Much truth, much falsehood, as their anger bids?
 The ardor of my courage will not slack
 For all thy speeches; we must combat first;
 Now, therefore, without more delay, begin,
 That we may taste each other's force in arms.[7]
 So spake �neas, and his brazen lance
 Hurl'd with full force against the dreadful shield.
 Loud roar'd its ample concave at the blow.
 Not unalarm'd, Pelides his broad disk
 Thrust farther from him, deeming that the force
 Of such an arm should pierce his guard with ease.
 Vain fear! he recollected not that arms
 Glorious as his, gifts of the immortal Gods,
 Yield not so quickly to the force of man.
 The stormy spear by brave �neas sent,
 No passage found; the golden plate divine
 Repress'd its vehemence; two folds it pierced,
 But three were still behind, for with five folds
 Vulcan had fortified it; two were brass;
 The two interior, tin; the midmost, gold;
 And at the golden one the weapon stood.[8]
 Achilles next, hurl'd his long shadow'd spear,
 And struck �neas on the utmost verge
 Of his broad shield, where thinnest lay the brass,
 And thinnest the ox-hide. The Pelian ash
 Started right through the buckler, and it rang.
 �neas crouch'd terrified, and his shield
 Thrust farther from him; but the rapid beam
 Bursting both borders of the ample disk,
 Glanced o'er his back, and plunged into the soil.
 He 'scaped it, and he stood; but, as he stood,
 With horror infinite the weapon saw
 Planted so near him. Then, Achilles drew
 His falchion keen, and with a deafening shout
 Sprang on him; but �neas seized a stone
 Heavy and huge, a weight to overcharge
 Two men (such men as are accounted strong
 Now) but he wielded it with ease, alone.
 Then had �neas, as Achilles came
 Impetuous on, smitten, although in vain,
 His helmet or his shield, and Peleus' son
 Had with his falchion him stretch'd at his feet,
 But that the God of Ocean quick perceived
 His peril, and the Immortals thus bespake.
 I pity brave �neas, who shall soon,
 Slain by Achilles, see the realms below,
 By smooth suggestions of Apollo lured
 To danger, such as he can ne'er avert.
 But wherefore should the Chief, guiltless himself,
 Die for the fault of others? at no time
 His gifts have fail'd, grateful to all in heaven.
 Come, therefore, and let us from death ourselves
 Rescue him, lest if by Achilles' arm
 This hero perish, Jove himself be wroth;
 For he is destined to survive, lest all
 The house of Dardanus (whom Jove beyond
 All others loved, his sons of woman born)
 Fail with �neas, and be found no more.
 Saturnian Jove hath hated now long time
 The family of Priam, and henceforth
 �neas and his son, and his sons' sons,
 Shall sway the sceptre o'er the race of Troy.
 To whom, majestic thus the spouse of Jove.
 Neptune! deliberate thyself, and choose
 Whether to save �neas, or to leave
 The hero victim of Achilles' ire.
 For Pallas and myself ofttimes have sworn
 In full assembly of the Gods, to aid
 Troy never, never to avert the day
 Of her distress, not even when the flames
 Kindled by the heroic sons of Greece,
 Shall climb with fury to her topmost towers.
 She spake; then Neptune, instant, through the throng
 Of battle flying, and the clash of spears,
 Came where Achilles and �neas fought.
 At once with shadows dim he blurr'd the sight
 Of Peleus' son, and from the shield, himself,
 Of brave �neas the bright-pointed ash
 Retracting, placed it at Achilles' feet.
 Then, lifting high �neas from the ground,
 He heaved him far remote; o'er many a rank
 Of heroes and of bounding steeds he flew,
 Launch'd into air from the expanded palm
 Of Neptune, and alighted in the rear
 Of all the battle where the Caucons stood.
 Neptune approach'd him there, and at his side
 Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus bespake.
 What God, �neas! tempted thee to cope
 Thus inconsiderately with the son
 Of Peleus, both more excellent in fight
 Than thou, and more the favorite of the skies?
 From him retire hereafter, or expect
 A premature descent into the shades.
 But when Achilles shall have once fulfill'd
 His destiny, in battle slain, then fight
 Fearless, for thou canst fall by none beside.
 So saying, he left the well-admonish'd Chief,
 And from Achilles' eyes scatter'd the gloom
 Shed o'er them by himself. The hero saw
 Clearly, and with his noble heart incensed
 By disappointment, thus conferring, said.
 Gods! I behold a prodigy. My spear
 Lies at my foot, and he at whom I cast
 The weapon with such deadly force, is gone!
 �neas therefore, as it seems, himself
 Interests the immortal Gods, although
 I deem'd his boast of their protection vain.
 I reck not. Let him go. So gladly 'scaped
 From slaughter now, he shall not soon again
 Feel an ambition to contend with me.
 Now will I rouse the Dana�, and prove
 The force in fight of many a Trojan more.
 He said, and sprang to battle with loud voice,
 Calling the Grecians after him.--Ye sons
 Of the Achaians! stand not now aloof,
 My noble friends! but foot to foot let each
 Fall on courageous, and desire the fight.
 The task were difficult for me alone,
 Brave as I boast myself, to chase a foe
 So numerous, and to combat with them all.
 Not Mars himself, immortal though he be,
 Nor Pallas, could with all the ranks contend
 Of this vast multitude, and drive the whole.
 With hands, with feet, with spirit and with might,
 All that I can I will; right through I go,
 And not a Trojan who shall chance within
 Spear's reach of me, shall, as I judge, rejoice.
 Thus he the Greeks exhorted. Opposite,
 Meantime, illustrious Hector to his host
 Vociferated, his design to oppose
 Achilles publishing in every ear.
 Fear not, ye valiant men of Troy! fear not
 The son of Peleus. In a war of words
 I could, myself, cope even with the Gods;
 But not with spears; there they excel us all.
 Nor shall Achilles full performance give
 To all his vaunts, but, if he some fulfil,
 Shall others leave mutilate in the midst.
 I will encounter him, though his hands be fire,
 Though fire his hands, and his heart hammer'd steel.
 So spake he them exhorting. At his word
 Uprose the Trojan spears, thick intermixt
 The battle join'd, and clamor loud began.
 Then thus, approaching Hector, Phoebus spake.
 Henceforth, advance not Hector! in the front
 Seeking Achilles, but retired within
 The stormy multitude his coming wait,
 Lest his spear reach thee, or his glittering sword.
 He said, and Hector far into his host
 Withdrew, admonish'd by the voice divine.
 Then, shouting terrible, and clothed with might,
 Achilles sprang to battle. First, he slew
 The valiant Chief Iphition, whom a band
 Numerous obey'd. Otrynteus was his sire.
 Him to Otrynteus, city-waster Chief,
 A Naiad under snowy Tmolus bore
 In fruitful Hyda.[9] Right into his front
 As he advanced, Achilles drove his spear,
 And rived his skull; with thundering sound he fell,
 And thus the conqueror gloried in his fall.
 Ah Otryntides! thou art slain. Here lies
 The terrible in arms, who born beside
 The broad Gyg�an lake, where Hyllus flows
 And Hermus, call'd the fertile soil his own.
 Thus gloried he. Meantime the shades of death
 Cover'd Iphition, and Achaian wheels
 And horses ground his body in the van.
 Demoleon next, Antenor's son, a brave
 Defender of the walls of Troy, he slew.
 Into his temples through his brazen casque
 He thrust the Pelian ash, nor could the brass
 Such force resist, but the huge weapon drove
 The shatter'd bone into his inmost brain,
 And his fierce onset at a stroke repress'd.
 Hippodamas his weapon next received
 Within his spine, while with a leap he left
 His steeds and fled. He, panting forth his life,
 Moan'd like a bull, by consecrated youths
 Dragg'd round the Heliconian King,[10] who views
 That victim with delight. So, with loud moans
 The noble warrior sigh'd his soul away.
 Then, spear in hand, against the godlike son
 Of Priam, Polydorus, he advanced.
 Not yet his father had to him indulged
 A warrior's place, for that of all his sons
 He was the youngest-born, his hoary sire's
 Chief darling, and in speed surpass'd them all.
 Then also, in the vanity of youth,
 For show of nimbleness, he started oft
 Into the vanward, till at last he fell.
 Him gliding swiftly by, swifter than he
 Achilles with a javelin reach'd; he struck
 His belt behind him, where the golden clasps
 Met, and the double hauberk interposed.
 The point transpierced his bowels, and sprang through
 His navel; screaming, on his knees he fell,
 Death-shadows dimm'd his eyes, and with both hands,
 Stooping, he press'd his gather'd bowels back.
 But noble Hector, soon as he beheld
 His brother Polydorus to the earth
 Inclined, and with his bowels in his hands,
 Sightless well-nigh with anguish could endure
 No longer to remain aloof; flame-like
 He burst abroad,[11] and shaking his sharp spear,
 Advanced to meet Achilles, whose approach
 Seeing, Achilles bounded with delight,
 And thus, exulting, to himself he said.
 Ah! he approaches, who hath stung my soul
 Deepest, the slayer of whom most I loved!
 Behold, we meet! Caution is at an end,
 And timid skulking in the walks of war.
 He ceased, and with a brow knit into frowns,
 Call'd to illustrious Hector. Haste, approach,
 That I may quick dispatch thee to the shades.
 Whom answer'd warlike Hector, nought appall'd.
 Pelides! hope not, as I were a boy,
 With words to scare me. I have also taunts
 At my command, and can be sharp as thou.
 I know thee valiant, and myself I know
 Inferior far; yet, whether thou shalt slay
 Me, or, inferior as I am, be slain
 By me, is at the pleasure of the Gods,
 For I wield also not a pointless beam.
 He said, and, brandishing it, hurl'd his spear,
 Which Pallas, breathing softly, wafted back
 From the renown'd Achilles, and it fell
 Successless at illustrious Hector's feet.
 Then, all on fire to slay him, with a shout
 That rent the air Achilles rapid flew
 Toward him; but him wrapt in clouds opaque
 Apollo caught with ease divine away.
 Thrice, swift Achilles sprang to the assault
 Impetuous, thrice the pitchy cloud he smote,
 And at his fourth assault, godlike in act,
 And terrible in utterance, thus exclaim'd.
 Dog! thou art safe, and hast escaped again;
 But narrowly, and by the aid once more
 Of Phoebus, without previous suit to whom
 Thou venturest never where the javelin sings.
 But when we next encounter, then expect,
 If one of all in heaven aid also me,
 To close thy proud career. Meantime I seek
 Some other, and assail e'en whom I may.
 So saying, he pierced the neck of Dryops through,
 And at his feet he fell. Him there he left,
 And turning on a valiant warrior huge,
 Philetor's son, Demuchus, in the knee
 Pierced, and detain'd him by the planted spear,
 Till with his sword he smote him, and he died.
 Laogonus and Dardanus he next
 Assaulted, sons of Bias; to the ground
 Dismounting both, one with his spear he slew,
 The other with his falchion at a blow.
 Tros too, Alastor's son--he suppliant clasp'd
 Achilles' knees, and for his pity sued,
 Pleading equality of years, in hope
 That he would spare, and send him thence alive.
 Ah dreamer! ignorant how much in vain
 That suit he urged; for not of milky mind,
 Or placable in temper was the Chief
 To whom he sued, but fiery. With both hands
 His knees he clasp'd importunate, and he
 Fast by the liver gash'd him with his sword.
 His liver falling forth, with sable blood
 His bosom fill'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 Then, drawing close to Mulius, in his ear
 He set the pointed brass, and at a thrust
 Sent it, next moment, through his ear beyond.
 Then, through the forehead of Agenor's son
 Echechlus, his huge-hafted blade he drove,
 And death and fate forever veil'd his eyes.
 Next, where the tendons of the elbow meet,
 Striking Deucalion, through his wrist he urged
 The brazen point; he all defenceless stood,
 Expecting death; down came Achilles' blade
 Full on his neck; away went head and casque
 Together; from his spine the marrow sprang,
 And at his length outstretch'd he press'd the plain.
 From him to Rhigmus, Pireus' noble son,
 He flew, a warrior from the fields of Thrace.
 Him through the loins he pierced, and with the beam
 Fixt in his bowels, to the earth he fell;
 Then piercing, as he turn'd to flight, the spine
 Of Areith�us his charioteer,
 He thrust him from his seat; wild with dismay
 Back flew the fiery coursers at his fall.
 As a devouring fire within the glens
 Of some dry mountain ravages the trees,
 While, blown around, the flames roll to all sides,
 So, on all sides, terrible as a God,
 Achilles drove the death-devoted host
 Of Ilium, and the champain ran with blood.
 As when the peasant his yoked steers employs
 To tread his barley, the broad-fronted pair
 With ponderous hoofs trample it out with ease,
 So, by magnanimous Achilles driven,
 His coursers solid-hoof'd stamp'd as they ran
 The shields, at once, and bodies of the slain;
 Blood spatter'd all his axle, and with blood
 From the horse-hoofs and from the fellied wheels
 His chariot redden'd, while himself, athirst
 For glory, his unconquerable hands
 Defiled with mingled carnage, sweat, and dust.
