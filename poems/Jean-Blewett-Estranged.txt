"It is good-bye," she said; "the world is wide,
 There's space for you and me to walk apart.
Though we have walked together side by side,
 My thoughts all yours, my resting-place your heart,
We now will go our different ways. Forget
 The happy past. I would not have you keep
One thought of me. Ah, yes, my eyes are wet;
 My love is great, my grief must needs be deep.

"Yet I have strength to look at you, and say:
 Forget it all, forget our souls were stirred,
Forget the sweetness of each dear, dead day,
 The warm, impassioned kiss, the tender word,
The clinging handclasp, and the love-filled eyes - 
 Forget all these; but, when we walk apart
Remember this, though wilful and unwise,
 No word of mine did ever hurt your heart."
