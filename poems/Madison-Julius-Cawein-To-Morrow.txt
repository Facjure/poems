A Lorelei full fair she sits
 Throned on the stream that dimly rolls;
Still, hope-thrilled, with her wild harp knits
 To her from year to year men's souls.

They hear her harp, they hear her song,
 Led by the wizard beauty high,
Like blind brutes maddened rush along,
 Sink at her cold feet, gasp and die.
