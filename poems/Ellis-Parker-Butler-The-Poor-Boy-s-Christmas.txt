title: The Poor Boy's Christmas
---

Observe, my child, this pretty scene,
And note the air of pleasure keen
With which the widowï¿½s orphan boy
Toots his tin horn, his only toy.
What need of costly gifts has he?
The widow has nowhere to flee.
And ample noise his horn emits
To drive the widow into fits.

Moral:

The philosophic mind can see
The uses of adversity.
