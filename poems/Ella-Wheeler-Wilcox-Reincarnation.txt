He slept as weary toilers do,
 She gazed up at the moon.
He stirred and said, "Wife, come to bed";
 She answered, "Soon, full soon."
(Oh! that strange mystery of the dead moon's face.)

Her cheek was wan, her wistful mouth
 Was lifted like a cup,
The moonful night dripped liquid light:
 She seemed to quaff it up.
(Oh! that unburied corpse that lies in space.)

Her life had held but drudgery - 
 She spelled her Bible thro';
Of books and lore she knew no more
 Than little children do.
(Oh! the weird wonder of that pallid sphere.)

Her youth had been a loveless waste,
 Starred by no holiday.
And she had wed for roof, and bread;
 She gave her work in pay.
(Oh! the moon-memories, vague and strange and dear.)

She drank the night's insidious wine,
 And saw another scene:
A stately room - rare flowers in bloom,
 Herself in silken sheen.
(Oh! vast the chambers of the moon, and wide.)

A step drew near, a curtain stirred;
 She shook with sweet alarms.
Oh! splendid face; oh! manly grace;
 Oh! strong impassioned arms.
(Oh! silent moon, what secrets do you hide!)

The warm red lips of thirsting love
 On cheek and brow were pressed;
As the bees know where honeys grow,
 They sought her mouth, her breast.
(Oh! the dead moon holds many a dead delight.)

The speaker stirred and gruffly spake,
 "Come, wife, where have you been?"
She whispered low, "Dear God, I go - 
 But 'tis the seventh sin."
(Oh! the sad secrets of that orb of white.)
