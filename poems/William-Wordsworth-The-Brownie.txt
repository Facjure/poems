 "How disappeared he?" Ask the newt and toad;
 Ask of his fellow-men, and they will tell
 How he was found, cold as an icicle,
 Under an arch of that forlorn abode;
 Where he, unpropped, and by the gathering flood
 Of years hemmed round, had dwelt, prepared to try
 Privation's worst extremities, and die
 With no one near save the omnipresent God.
 Verily so to live was an awful choice
 A choice that wears the aspect of a doom;
 But in the mould of mercy all is cast
 For Souls familiar with the eternal Voice;
 And this forgotten Taper to the last
 Drove from itself, we trust, all frightful gloom.
