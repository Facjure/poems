 Sing; how 'a would sing!
 How 'a would raise the tune
When we rode in the waggon from harvesting
 By the light o' the moon!

 Dance; how 'a would dance!
 If a fiddlestring did but sound
She would hold out her coats, give a slanting glance,
 And go round and round.

 Laugh; how 'a would laugh!
 Her peony lips would part
As if none such a place for a lover to quaff
 At the deeps of a heart.

 Julie, O girl of joy,
 Soon, soon that lover he came.
Ah, yes; and gave thee a baby-boy,
 But never his name . . .

 - Tolling for her, as you guess;
 And the baby too . . . 'Tis well.
You knew her in maidhood likewise? - Yes,
 That's her burial bell.

 "I suppose," with a laugh, she said,
 "I should blush that I'm not a wife;
But how can it matter, so soon to be dead,
 What one does in life!"

 When we sat making the mourning
 By her death-bed side, said she,
"Dears, how can you keep from your lovers, adorning
 In honour of me!"

 Bubbling and brightsome eyed!
 But now - O never again.
She chose her bearers before she died
 From her fancy-men.
