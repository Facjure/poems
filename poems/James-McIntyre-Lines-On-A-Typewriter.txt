title: Lines On A Typewriter.

Having received a letter from a gentleman glorying in his typewriter we replied as follows:


You glory in your typewriter,
And its virtues you rehearse,
But we prefer the old inditer,
For to write either prose or verse.

And let each man work his will,
But never never do abuse
The ancient and glorious quill
From the wing of a fine old goose.
