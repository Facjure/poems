(Moon Poems for the Children/Fairy-tales for the Children)
 (What the Carpenter Said)


 The moon's a cottage with a door.
 Some folks can see it plain.
 Look, you may catch a glint of light,
 A sparkle through the pane,
 Showing the place is brighter still
 Within, though bright without.
 There, at a cosy open fire
 Strange babes are grouped about.
 The children of the wind and tide - 
 The urchins of the sky,
 Drying their wings from storms and things
 So they again can fly.
