 It's easy to fight when everything's right,
 And you're mad with the thrill and the glory;
 It's easy to cheer when victory's near,
 And wallow in fields that are gory.
 It's a different song when everything's wrong,
 When you're feeling infernally mortal;
 When it's ten against one, and hope there is none,
 Buck up, little soldier, and chortle:

 Carry on! Carry on!
 There isn't much punch in your blow.
 You're glaring and staring and hitting out blind;
 You're muddy and bloody, but never you mind.
 Carry on! Carry on!
 You haven't the ghost of a show.
 It's looking like death, but while you've a breath,
 Carry on, my son! Carry on!

 And so in the strife of the battle of life
 It's easy to fight when you're winning;
 It's easy to slave, and starve and be brave,
 When the dawn of success is beginning.
 But the man who can meet despair and defeat
 With a cheer, there's the man of God's choosing;
 The man who can fight to Heaven's own height
 Is the man who can fight when he's losing.

 Carry on! Carry on!
 Things never were looming so black.
 But show that you haven't a cowardly streak,
 And though you're unlucky you never are weak.
 Carry on! Carry on!
 Brace up for another attack.
 It's looking like hell, but - you never can tell:
 Carry on, old man! Carry on!

 There are some who drift out in the deserts of doubt,
 And some who in brutishness wallow;
 There are others, I know, who in piety go
 Because of a Heaven to follow.
 But to labour with zest, and to give of your best,
 For the sweetness and joy of the giving;
 To help folks along with a hand and a song;
 Why, there's the real sunshine of living.

 Carry on! Carry on!
 Fight the good fight and true;
 Believe in your mission, greet life with a cheer;
 There's big work to do, and that's why you are here.
 Carry on! Carry on!
 Let the world be the better for you;
 And at last when you die, let this be your cry:
 CARRY ON, MY SOUL! CARRY ON!
