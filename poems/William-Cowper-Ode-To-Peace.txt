Come, peace of mind, delightful guest!
Return, and make thy downy nest
Once more in this sad heart:
Nor riches I nor power pursue,
Nor hold forbidden joys in view;
We therefore need not part.


Where wilt thou dwell, if not with me,
From avarice and ambition free,
And pleasure�s fatal wiles?
For whom, alas! dost thou prepare
The sweets that I was wont to share,
The banquet of thy smiles?


The great, the gay, shall they partake
The heaven that thou alone canst make?
And wilt thou quit the stream
That murmurs through the dewy mead,
The grove and the sequester�d shed,
To be a guest with them?


For thee I panted, thee I prized,
For thee I gladly sacrificed
Whate�er I loved before;
And shall I see thee start away,
And helpless, hopeless, hear thee say�
Farewell! we meet no more?
