Come, bring your sampler, and with art
Draw in't a wounded heart,
And dropping here and there;
Not that I think that any dart
Can make your's bleed a tear,
Or pierce it any where;
Yet do it to this end, that I
May by
This secret see,
Though you can make
That heart to bleed, your's ne'er will ache
For me,
