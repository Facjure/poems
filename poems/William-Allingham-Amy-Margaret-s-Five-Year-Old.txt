Amy Margaret's five years old, 
Amy Margaret's hair is gold, 
Dearer twenty-thousand-fold 
Than gold, is Amy Margaret. 
"Amy" is friend, is "Margaret" 
The pearl for crown or carkanet? 
Or peeping daisy, summer's pet? 
Which are you, Amy Margaret? 
A friend, a daisy, and a pearl, 
A kindly, simple, precious girl, 
Such, howsoe'er the world may twirl, 
Be ever, Amy Margaret!
