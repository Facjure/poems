title: After A Parting
---

Farewell has long been said; I have forgone thee;
 I never name thee even.
But how shall I learn virtues and yet shun thee?
 For thou art so near Heaven
That heavenward meditations pause upon thee.

Thou dost beset the path to every shrine;
 My trembling thoughts discern
Thy goodness in the good for which I pine;
 And if I turn from but one sin, I turn
Unto a smile of thine.

How shall I thrust thee apart
 Since all my growth tends to thee night and day--
To thee faith, hope, and art?
 Swift are the currents setting all one way;
They draw my life, my life, out of my heart.
