[1]

 A picture once was shown,
 In which one man, alone,
 Upon the ground had thrown
 A lion fully grown.
 Much gloried at the sight the rabble.
 A lion thus rebuked their babble: - 
 'That you have got the victory there,
 There is no contradiction.
 But, gentles, possibly you are
 The dupes of easy fiction:
 Had we the art of making pictures,
 Perhaps our champion had beat yours!'
