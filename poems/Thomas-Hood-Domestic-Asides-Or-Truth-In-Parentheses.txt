"I really take it very kind,
This visit, Mrs. Skinner!
I have not seen you such an age - 
(The wretch has come to dinner!)

"Your daughters, too, what loves of girls - 
What heads for painters' easels!
Come here and kiss the infant, dears - 
(And give it p'rhaps the measles!)

"Your charming boys I see are home
From Reverend Mr. Russell's;
'Twas very kind to bring them both - 
(What boots for my new Brussels!)

"What! little Clara left at home?
Well now I call that shabby:
I should have loved to kiss her so - 
(A flabby, dabby, babby!)

"And Mr. S., I hope he's well,
Ah! though he lives so handy,
He never now drops in to sup - 
(The better for our brandy!)

"Come, take a seat - I long to hear
About Matilda's marriage;
You're come of course to spend the day!
(Thank Heaven, I hear the carriage!)

"What! must you go? next time I hope
You'll give me longer measure;
Nay - I shall see you down the stairs - 
(With most uncommon pleasure!)

"Good-bye! good-bye! remember all,
Next time you'll take your dinners!
(Now, David, mind I'm not at home
In future to the Skinners!")
