Close by the threshold of a door nail�d fast
Three kittens sat; each kitten look�d aghast.
I, passing swift and inattentive by,
At the three kittens cast a careless eye;
Not much concern�d to know what they did there;
Not deeming kittens worth a poet�s care.
But presently a loud and furious hiss
Caused me to stop and to exclaim, �What�s this?�
When lo! upon the threshold met my view
With head erect, and eyes of fiery hue,
A viper long as Count de Grasse�s queue.
Forth from his head his forked tongue he throws,
Darting it full against a kitten�s nose;
Who, having never seen, in field or house,
The like, sat still and silent as a mouse;
Only projecting with attention due,
Her whisker�d face, she asked him, �Who are you?�
On to the hall went I, with pace not slow,
But swift as lightning, for a long Dutch hoe:
With which well arm�d I hasten�d to the spot,
To find the viper, but I found him not.
And, turning up the leaves and shrubs around,
Found only that he was not to be found.
But still the kittens, sitting as before,
Sat watching close the bottom of the door.
�I hope, � said I, �the villain I would kill
Has slipp�d between the door and the door-sill;
And if I make despatch, and follow hard,
No doubt but I shall find him in the yard:�
For long ere now it should have been rehearsed,
�Twas in the garden that I found him first.
E�en there I found him, there the full-grown cat,
His head, with velvet paw, did gently pat;
As curious as the kittens erst had been
To learn what this phenomenon might mean.
Fill�d with heroic ardour at the sight,
And fearing every moment he would bite,
And rob our household of our only cat
That was of age to combat with a rat;
With outstretch�d hoe I slew him at the door,
And taught him never to come there no more.
