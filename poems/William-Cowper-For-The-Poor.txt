When Hagar found the bottle spent,
And wept o�er Ishmael,
A message from the Lord was sent
To guide her to a well.[1]


Should not Elijah�s cake and cruse[2]
Convince us at this day,
A gracious God will not refuse
Provisions by the way?


His saints and servants shall be fed,
The promise is secure;
�Bread shall be given them,� he has said,
�Their water shall be sure.�[3]


Repasts far richer they shall prove,
Than all earth�s dainties are;
�Tis sweet to taste a Saviour�s love,
Though in the meanest fare.


To Jesus then your trouble bring,
Nor murmur at your lot;
While you are poor and he is King,
You shall not be forgot.
