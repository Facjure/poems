 Two little children sit by my side,
 I call them Lily and Daffodil;
 I gaze on them with a mother's pride,
 One is Edna, the other is Will.

 Both have eyes of starry light,
 And laughing lips o'er teeth of pearl.
 I would not change for a diadem
My noble boy and darling girl.

 To-night my heart o'erflows with joy;
 I hold them as a sacred trust;
 I fain would hide them in my heart,
 Safe from tarnish of moth and rust.

 What should I ask for my dear boy?
 The richest gifts of wealth or fame?
 What for my girl? A loving heart
 And a fair and a spotless name?

 What for my boy? That he should stand
 A pillar of strength to the state?
 What for my girl? That she should be
 The friend of the poor and desolate?

 I do not ask they shall never tread
 With weary feet the paths of pain.
 I ask that in the darkest hour
 They may faithful and true remain.

 I only ask their lives may be
 Pure as gems in the gates of pearl,
 Lives to brighten and bless the world -
 This I ask for my boy and girl.


 I ask to clasp their hands again
 'Mid the holy hosts of heaven,
 Enraptured say: "I am here, oh! God,
 "And the children Thou hast given."
