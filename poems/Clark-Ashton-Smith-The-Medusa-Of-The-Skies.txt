title: The Medusa Of The Skies
---

Haggard as if resurgent from a tomb,
 The moon uprears her ghastly, shrunken head,
 Crowned with such light as flares upon the dead
From pallid skies more death-like than the gloom.
Now fall her beams till slope and plain assume
 The whiteness of a land whence life is fled;
 And shadows that a sepulcher might shed
Move livid as the stealthy hands of doom.

O'er rigid hills and valleys locked and mute,
 A pallor steals as of a world made still
When Death, that erst had crept, stands absolute -
An earth now frozen fast by power of eyes
That malefice and purposed silence fill,
The gaze of that Medusa of the skies.
