The embers were blinking and clinking away,
The casement half open was thrown;
There was nothing but cloud on the skirts of the Day,
And I sat on the threshold alone!

And said to the river which flowed by my door
With its beautiful face to the hill,
�I have waited and waited, all wearied and sore,
But my love is a wanderer still!�

And said to the wind, as it paused in its flight
To look through the shivering pane,
�There are memories moaning and homeless to-night
That can never be tranquil again!�

And said to the woods, as their burdens were borne
With a flutter and sigh to the eaves,
�They are wrinkled and wasted, and tattered and torn,
And we too have our withering leaves.�

Did I hear a low echo of footfalls about,
Whilst watching those forest trees stark?
Or was it a dream that I hurried without
To clutch at and grapple the dark?

In the shadow I stood for a moment and spake
�Bright thing that was loved in the past,
Oh! am I asleep or abroad and awake?
And are you so near me at last?

�Oh, roamer from lands where the vanished years go,
Oh, waif from those mystical zones,
Come here where I long for you, broken and low,
On the mosses and watery stones!

�Come out of your silence and tell me if Life
Is so fair in that world as they say;
Was it worth all this yearning, and weeping, and strife
When you left it behind you to-day?

�Will it end all this watching, and doubting, and dread?
Do these sorrows die out with our breath?
Will they pass from our souls like a nightmare,� I said,
�While we glide through the mazes of Death?

�Come out of that darkness and teach me the lore
You have learned since I looked on your face;
By the summers that blossomed and faded of yore
By the lights which have fled to that place!

�You answer me not when I know that you could
When I know that you could and you should;
Though the storms be abroad on the wave;
Though the rain droppeth down with a wail to the wood,
And my heart is as cold as your grave!�
