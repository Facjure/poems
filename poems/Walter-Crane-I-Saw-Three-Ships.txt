title: I Saw Three Ships
---

1.
I saw three ships come sailing by,
Sailing by, sailing by,
I saw three ships come sailing by,
On New-year's Day in the morning.

2.
And what do you think was in them then,
In them then, in them then,
And what do you think was in them then,
On New-year's Day in the morning?

3.
Three pretty girls were in them then,
In them then, in them then,
Three pretty girls were in them then,
On New-year's Day in the morning.

4.
And one could whistle, and one could sing,
The other play on the violin;
Such joy there was at my wedding,
On New-year's Day in the morning.
