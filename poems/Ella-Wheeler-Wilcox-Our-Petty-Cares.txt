title: Our Petty Cares
---

Our petty cares wear on us so, -
More cruel than our great despairs,
More rasping than a mighty woe,
 Our petty cares.

Less need of strength hath he who bears
Courageously some stinging blow,
Of Fate which takes him unawares.

Not solitary griefs we know
Induce old age and whitening hairs;
But that malicious, endless row -
 Our petty cares.
