Most delicate Ariel! submissive thing,
Won by the mind's high magic to its hest - 
Invisible embassy, or secret guest, - 
Weighing the light air on a lighter wing; - 
Whether into the midnight moon, to bring
Illuminate visions to the eye of rest, - 
Or rich romances from the florid West, - 
Or to the sea, for mystic whispering, - 
Still by thy charm'd allegiance to the will,
The fruitful wishes prosper in the brain,
As by the fingering of fairy skill, - 
Moonlight, and waters, and soft music's strain,
Odors, and blooms, and my Miranda's smile,
Making this dull world an enchanted isle.
