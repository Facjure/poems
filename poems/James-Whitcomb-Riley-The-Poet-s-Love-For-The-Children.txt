---

 Kindly and warm and tender,
 He nestled each childish palm
 So close in his own that his touch was a prayer
 And his speech a blessed psalm.

 He has turned from the marvelous pages
 Of many an alien tome -
 Haply come down from Olivet,
 Or out from the gates of Rome -

 Set sail o'er the seas between him
 And each little beckoning hand
 That fluttered about in the meadows
 And groves of his native land, -

 Fluttered and flashed on his vision
 As, in the glimmering light
 Of the orchard-lands of childhood,
 The blossoms of pink and white.

 And there have been sobs in his bosom,
 As out on the shores he stept,
 And many a little welcomer
 Has wondered why he wept. -

 That was because, O children,
 Ye might not always be
 The same that the Savior's arms were wound
 About, in Galilee.
