Leonainie - Angels named her;
 And they took the light
Of the laughing stars and framed her
 In a smile of white;
And they made her hair of gloomy
Midnight, and her eyes of bloomy
Moonshine, and they brought her to me
 In the solemn night. - -

In a solemn night of summer,
 When my heart of gloom
Blossomed up to greet the comer
 Like a rose in bloom;
All forebodings that distressed me
I forgot as Joy caressed me -
(Lying Joy! that caught and pressed me
 In the arms of doom!)

Only spake the little lisper
 In the Angel-tongue;
Yet I, listening, heard her whisper -
 "Songs are only sung
Here below that they may grieve you -
Tales but told you to deceive you, -
So must Leonainie leave you
 While her love is young."

Then God smiled and it was morning.
 Matchless and supreme
Heaven's glory seemed adorning
 Earth with its esteem:
Every heart but mine seemed gifted
With the voice of prayer, and lifted
Where my Leonainie drifted
 From me like a dream.
