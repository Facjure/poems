 Say, I like toys,
Christmas toys.
 Remember when we were boys
Long ago?
 Then you were a kid
Not a beau.
 And on Christmas Day,
Oh, say,
 We got up in the dark
And had a jolly lark
 Round the fire.
The cold air was shocking
 As we peeped in our stocking--
And, way down in the toe,
 Now say this is so--
Dad placed a dollar.
 Made me holler.
Yes, sirree,

 They were good to me.
Remember Jim?
 Mean trick I did him.
You know Jim was surly?
 Well I got up early
Took his dollar out,
 And put a rock
In his sock.
 Gee, he was mad,
Went and told dad;
 But dad he just laughed
And said:
 Might's well be dead
If you couldn't have fun.
 Then for spite,
I kept that dollar 'til night.
 Funny, seein' these toys
Made me think of us boys.
 But now, Gee!
Christmas ain't like it used to be.
