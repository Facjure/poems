title: To The Accuser Who Is The God Of This World

Truly My Satan thou art but a Dunce
And dost not know the Garment from the Man
Every Harlot was a Virgin once
Nor canst thou ever change Kate into Nan

Tho thou art Worship'd by the Names Divine
Of Jesus &amp; Jehovah thou art still
The Son of Morn in weary Nights decline
The lost Travellers Dream under the Hill
