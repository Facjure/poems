I.

 The leaves are shivering on the thorn,
 Drearily;
 And sighing wakes the lean-eyed morn,
 Wearily.

 I press my thin face to the pane,
 Drearily;
 But never will he come again.
 (Wearily.)

 The rain hath sicklied day with haze,
 Drearily;
 My tears run downward as I gaze,
 Wearily.

 The mist and morn spake unto me,
 Drearily:
 "What is this thing God gives to thee?"
 (Wearily.)

 I said unto the morn and mist,
 Drearily:
 "The babe unborn whom sin hath kissed."
 (Wearily.)

 The morn and mist spake unto me,
 Drearily:
 "What is this thing which thou dost see?"
 (Wearily.)

 I said unto the mist and morn,
 Drearily:
 "The shame of man and woman's scorn."
 (Wearily.)

 "He loved thee not," they made reply.
 Drearily.
 I said, "Would God had let me die!"
 (Wearily.)


II.

 My dreams are as a closed up book,
 (Drearily.)
 Upon whose clasp of love I look,
 Wearily.

 All night the rain raved overhead,
 Drearily;
 All night I wept awake in bed,
 Wearily.

 I heard the wind sweep wild and wide,
 Drearily;
 I turned upon my face and sighed,
 Wearily.

 The wind and rain spake unto me,
 Drearily:
 "What is this thing God takes from thee?"
 (Wearily.)

 I said unto the rain and wind,
 Drearily:
 "The love, for which my soul hath sinned."
 (Wearily.)

 The rain and wind spake unto me,
 Drearily:
 "What are these things thou still dost see?"
 (Wearily.)

 I said unto the wind and rain,
 Drearily:
 "Regret, and hope despair hath slain."
 (Wearily.)

 "Thou lov'st him still," they made reply,
 Drearily.
 I said, "That God would let me die!"
 (Wearily.)
