title: Lovest Thou Me? - John xxi.16.
---

Hark, my soul! it is the Lord:
�Tis thy Saviour, hear his word;
Jesus speaks, and speaks to thee:
�Say, poor sinner, lovest thou me?


�I deliver�d thee when bound,
And when bleeding, heal�d thy wound;
Sought thee wandering, set thee right,
Turn�d thy darkness into light.


�Can a woman�s tender care
Cease towards the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee.


�Mine is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above;
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.


�Thou shalt see my glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of my throne shalt be: -
Say, poor sinner, lovest thou me?�


Lord, it is my chief complaint,
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love thee and adore:
Oh for grace to love thee more!
