title: Path Of Life. (From The Villager's Verse-Book.)

 O Lord, in sickness and in health,
To every lot resigned,
Grant me, before all worldly wealth,
A meek and thankful mind!

 As, life, thy upland path we tread,
And often pause in vain,
To think of friends and parents dead,
Oh, let us not complain!

 The Lord may give or take away,
But nought our faith can move,
Whilst we to heaven can look and say,
Our Father lives above.
