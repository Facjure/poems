Sleep, little baby, sleep, love, sleep!
 Evening is coming, and night is nigh;
Under the lattice the little birds cheep,
 All will be sleeping by and by.
Sleep, little baby, sleep.

Sleep, little baby, sleep, love, sleep!
 Darkness is creeping along the sky;
Stars at the casement glimmer and peep,
 Slowly the moon comes sailing by.
Sleep, little baby, sleep.

Sleep, little baby, sleep, love, sleep!
 Sleep till the dawning has dappled the sky;
Under the lattice the little birds cheep,
 All will be waking by and by.
Sleep, little baby, sleep.
