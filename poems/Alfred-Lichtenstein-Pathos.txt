You don't love me...I have never appealed to you...
Was never your type...
And my hard eyes annoy you, my darling...
I'm too dark for you.And too coarse - 
And my white teeth have such a brutal shine
And my bloody lips are so terribly like sickles.
Ah, what you say - 
Yes you are really right.I set you... free.
...And early in the morning I am going to an ocean
That is blue and eternal...
And lie on the beach...
And play with a smile on my face, until a death grabs me,
With sand and sun and with a white
Slender bitch.
