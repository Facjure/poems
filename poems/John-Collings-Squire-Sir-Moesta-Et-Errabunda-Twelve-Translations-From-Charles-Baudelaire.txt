 Agatha, tell me, does thy heart not ache,
 Plunged in this squalid city's filthy sea,
 For another ocean where the splendours break
 Blue, clear, and deep as is virginity.
 Agatha, tell me, does thy heart not ache?

 The sea, the sea unending, comforts us!
 What demon gave the hoarse old sea who sings
 To her mumbling hurricanes' organ thunderous
 The god-like power to cradle sorrowful things?
 The sea, the sea unending, comforts us.

 Carry me, wagon, bear me, barque, away!
 Far! Far! For here the mud is made of tears!
 Does Agatha's sad heart not sometimes say:
 "O far from shudderings and crimes and fears,
 Carry me, wagon; bear me barque, away?"

 How far thou art, O scented paradise,
 O paradise where all is love and joy,
 Where all is worthy love 'neath the azure skies,
 And the heart drowns in bliss without alloy!
 How far thou art, O scented paradise!

 But the green paradise of childish loves,
 The games, the songs, the kisses and the flowers,
 The laughing draughts of wine in hidden groves,
 The violins throbbing through the twilight hours,
 But the green paradise of childish loves,

 The artless paradise of stealthy joys,
 Is that already leagues beyond Cathay?
 And can one, with a little plaintive noise,
 Bring it again that is so far away, 
 The artless paradise of stealthy joys?
