TO KENNA.

 England, a long farewell! a long farewell,
 My country, to thy woods, and streams, and hills!
 Where I have heard in youth the Sabbath bell,
 For many a year now mute: affection fills
 Mine eyes with tears; yet resolute to wait,
 Whatever ills betide, whatever fate;
 Far from my native land, from sights of woe,
 From scaffolds drenched in generous blood, I go.[204]
 Sad, in a land of strangers, when I bend
 With grief of heart, without a home or friend,
 And chiefly when with weary thoughts oppressed,
 I see the sun sink slowly in the west;
 Then, doubly feeling my forsaken lot,
 I shall remember, far away, this cot
 Of humble piety, and prayer, and peace,
 And thee, dear friend, till my heart's beatings cease.
 Warm from that heart I breathe one parting prayer:
 My good old friend, may God Almighty spare - 
 Spare, for the sake of that poor child,[205] thy life, - 
 Long spare it for thy meek and duteous wife.
 Perhaps o'er them, when the hard storm blows loud,
 We both may be at rest and in our shroud;
 Or we may live to talk of these sad times,
 When virtue was reviled, and direst crimes
 Faith's awful name usurped. We may again
 Hear heavenly truths in the time-hallowed fane,
 And the full chant. Oh! if that day arrive,
 And we, old friend, though bowed with age, survive,
 How happy, whilst our days on earth shall last,
 To pray and think of seasons that are past,
 Till on our various way the night shall close,
 And in one hallowed pile, at last, our bones repose.[206]
