Only a spar from a broken ship
 Washed in by a careless wave;
But it brought back the smile of a vanished lip,
 And his past peered out of the grave.

Only a leaf that an idle breeze
 Tossed at her passing feet;
But she seemed to stand under the dear old trees,
 And life again was sweet.

Only the bar of a tender strain
 They sang in days gone by;
But the old love woke in her heart again,
 The love they had sworn should die.

Only the breath of a faint perfume
 That floated up from a rose;
But the bolts slid back from a marble tomb,
 And I looked on a dear dead face.

Who vaunts the might of a human will,
 When a perfume or a sound
Can wake a Past that we bade lie still,
 And open a long closed wound?
