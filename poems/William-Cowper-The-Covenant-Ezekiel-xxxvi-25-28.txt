The Lord proclaims his grace abroad!
Behold, I change your hearts of stone;
Each shall renounce his idol-god,
And serve, henceforth, the Lord alone.


My grace, a flowing stream, proceeds
To wash your filthiness away;
Ye shall abhor your former deeds,
And learn my statutes to obey.


My truth the great design ensures,
I give myself away to you;
You shall be mine, I will be yours,
Your God unalterably true.


Yet not unsought, or unimplored,
The plenteous grace shall I confer;[1]
No - your whole hearts shall seek the Lord,
Iï¿½ll put a praying spirit there.


From the first breath of life divine,
Down to the last expiring hour,
The gracious work shall all be mine,
Begun and ended in my power.
