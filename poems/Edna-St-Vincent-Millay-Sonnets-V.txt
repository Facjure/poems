 Once more into my arid days like dew,
 Like wind from an oasis, or the sound
 Of cold sweet water bubbling underground,
 A treacherous messenger, the thought of you
 Comes to destroy me; once more I renew
 Firm faith in your abundance, whom I found
 Long since to be but just one other mound
 Of sand, whereon no green thing ever grew.
 And once again, and wiser in no wise,
 I chase your colored phantom on the air,
 And sob and curse and fall and weep and rise
 And stumble pitifully on to where,
 Miserable and lost, with stinging eyes,
 Once more I clasp,--and there is nothing there.
