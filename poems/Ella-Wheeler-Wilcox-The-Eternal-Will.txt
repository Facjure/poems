title: The Eternal Will
---

There is no thing we cannot overcome
 Say not thy evil instinct is inherited,
Or that some trait inborn makes thy whole life forlorn,
 And calls down punishment that is not merited.

Back of thy parents and grandparents lies
 The Great Eternal Will.That, too, is thine
 Inheritance; strong, beautiful, divine,
Sure lever of success for one who tries.

Pry up thy faults with this great lever, Will.
 However deeply bedded in propensity,
However firmly set, I tell thee firmer yet
 Is that vast power that comes from Truth's immensity.

Thou art a part of that strange world, I say.
 Its forces lie within thee, stronger far
 Than all thy mortal sins and frailties are,
Believe thyself divine, and watch, and pray.

There is no noble height thou canst not climb.
 All triumphs may be thine in Time's futurity,
If whatso'er thy fault, thou dost not faint or halt,
 But lean upon the staff of God's security.

Earth has no claim the soul can not contest.
 Know thyself part of that Eternal Source,
 And naught can stand before thy spirit's force.
The soul's divine inheritance is best.
