'Twas a fit hour for parting,
 For athwart the leaden sky
The heavy clouds came gathering
 And sailing gloomily:
The earth was drunk with heaven's tears,
 And each moaning autumn breeze
Shook the burthen of its weeping
 Off the overladen trees.
The waterfall rushed swollen down,
 In the gloaming, still and gray;
With a foam-wreath on the angry brow
 Of each wave that flashed away.
My tears were mingling with the rain,
 That fell so cold and fast,
And my spirit felt thy low deep sigh
 Through the wild and roaring blast.
The beauty of the summer woods
 Lay rustling round our feet,
And all fair things had passed away - 
 'Twas an hour for parting meet.
