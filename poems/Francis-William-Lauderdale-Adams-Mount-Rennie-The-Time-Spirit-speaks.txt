 "Poor lads! And you for others' wrongs and sins
 Whose dead past greed and lust did never wince
To make your fathers, mothers, and now you
 Miserable fiends in hell, must expiate, since

"We the more guilty, we the strong, the few,
Whose triumph thrusts you down into the stew,
 Fear lest our victims rise and rend us, fear
This problem mad we will not listen to!

 "Victims, with her your fellow-victim here,
 Blind, deaf, dumb beasts, the hour shall yet appear
When men, when justicers resolute-terrible, you
 Shall speak and all men tremble as they hear!"
