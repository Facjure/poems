TALISMANS.

God is of the east possess'd,
God is ruler of the west;
North and south alike, each land
Rests within His gentle hand.
 -
He, the only righteous one,
Wills that right to each be done.
'Mongst His hundred titles, then,
Highest praised be this! Amen.
 -
Error seeketh to deceive me,
Thou art able to retrieve me;
Both in action and in song
Keep my course from going wrong.
