While before St. Agnes' shrine
 Knelt a true knight's lady-love,
From the wars of Palestine
 Came a gentle carrier-dove.
Round his neck a Silken string
 Fastened words the warrior writ:
At her call he stooped his wing,
 And upon her finger lit.

She, like one enchanted, pored
 O'er the contents of the scroll--
For that lady loved her lord
 With a pure, devoted soul.
To her heart her dove she drew,
 While she traced the burning line;
Then away his minion flew
 Back to sainted Palestine.

To and fro, from hand to hand
 Came and went a carrier-dove,
Till throughout the Holy Land
 War resigned his sword to Love.
Swift her dove, on wings of light,
 Brought the news from Palestine,
And the lady her true knight
 Wedded at St. Agnes' shrine.
