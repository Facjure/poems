title: No Man Goeth Alone
---

Where one is,
There am I,--
No man goeth alone!

Though he fly to earth's remotest bound,
Though his soul in the depths of sin be drowned,--
No man goeth alone!

Though he take him the wings of fear, and flee
Past the outermost realms of light;
Though he weave him a garment of mystery,
And hide in the womb of night,--
No man goeth alone!

Though apart in the city's heart he dwell,
Though he wander beyond the stars,
Though he bury himself in his nethermost hell,
And vanish behind the bars,--
No man goeth alone!

For I, God, am the soul of man,
And none can Me dethrone.
Where one is,
There am I,--
No man goeth alone!
