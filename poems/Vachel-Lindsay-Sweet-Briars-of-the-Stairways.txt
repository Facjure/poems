title: Sweet Briars of the Stairways

We are happy all the time
Even when we fight:
Sweet briars of the stairways,
Gay fairies of the grime;
WE, WHO ARE PLAYING TO-NIGHT.

"Our feet are in the gutters,
Our eyes are sore with dust,
But still our eyes are bright.
The wide street roars and mutters - 
We know it works because it must - 
WE, WHO ARE PLAYING TO-NIGHT!

"Dirt is everlasting. -We never, never fear it.
Toil is never ceasing. -We will play until we near it.
Tears are never ending. -When once real tears have come;

"When we see our people as they are - 
Our fathers - broken, dumb - 
Our mothers - broken, dumb - 
The weariest of women and of men;
Ah - then our eyes will lose their light - 
Then we will never play again - 
WE, WHO ARE PLAYING TO-NIGHT."
