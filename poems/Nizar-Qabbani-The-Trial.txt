title: The Trial

The East receives my songs, some praise, some curse
To each of them my gratitude I bear
For I've avenged the blood of each slain woman
and haven offered her who is in fear.

Woman's rebellious heart I have supported
ready to pay the price, content to die
if love should slay me, for I am love's champion
and if I ceased, then I would not be I.
