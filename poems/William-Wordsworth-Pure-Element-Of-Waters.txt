title: Pure Element Of Waters!
---

 Pure element of waters! wheresoe'er
 Thou dost forsake thy subterranean haunts,
 Green herbs, bright flowers, and berry-bearing plants,
 Rise into life and in thy train appear:
 And, through the sunny portion of the year,
 Swift insects shine, thy hovering pursuivants:
 And, if thy bounty fail, the forest pants;
 And hart and hind and hunter with his spear,
 Languish and droop together. Nor unfelt
 In man's perturbed soul thy sway benign;
 And, haply, far within the marble belt
 Of central earth, where tortured Spirits pine
 For grace and goodness lost, thy murmurs melt
 Their anguish, and they blend sweet songs with thine.
