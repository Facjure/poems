Ah, God! were I away, away,
 By woodland-belted hills!
There might be more in Thy bright day
 Than my poor spirit thrills.

The elder coppice, banks of blooms,
 The spice-wood brush, the field
Of tumbled clover, and perfumes
 Hot, weedy pastures yield.

The old rail-fence whose angles hold
 Bright briar and sassafras,
Sweet priceless wild flowers blue and gold
 Starred through the moss and grass.

The ragged path that winds unto
 Lone cow-behaunted nooks,
Through brambles to the shade and dew
 Of rocks and woody brooks.

To see the minnows turn and gleam
 White sparkling bellies, all
Shoot in gray schools adown the stream
 Let but a dead leaf fall.

The buoyant pleasure and delight
 Of floating feathered seeds.
Capricious wanderers soft and white
 Born of silk-bearing weeds.

Ah, God! were I away, away,
 Among wild woods and birds!
There were more soul within Thy day
 Than one might bless with words.
