title: The Fall Of The Year
---

 The Autumn's come again,
 And the clouds descend in rain,
 And the leaves are fast falling in the wood;
 The Summer's voice is still,
 Save the clacking of the mill
 And the lowly-muttered thunder of the flood.

 There's nothing in the mead
 But the river's muddy speed,
 And the willow leaves all littered by its side.
 Sweet voices are all still
 In the vale and on the hill,
 And the Summer's blooms are withered in their pride.

 Fled is the cuckoo's note
 To countries far remote,
 And the nightingale is vanished from the woods;
 If you search the lordship round
 There is not a blossom found,
 And where the hay-cock scented is the flood.

 My true love's fled away
 Since we walked 'mid cocks of hay,
 On the Sabbath in the Summer of the year;
 And she's nowhere to be seen
 On the meadow or the green,
 But she's coming when the happy Spring is near.

 When the birds begin to sing,
 And the flowers begin to spring,
 And the cowslips in the meadows reappear,
 When the woodland oaks are seen
 In their monarchy of green,
 Then Mary and love's pleasures will be here.
