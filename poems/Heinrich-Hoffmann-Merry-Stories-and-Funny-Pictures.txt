title: Merry Stories and Funny Pictures
---

When the children have been good,
That is, be it understood,
Good at meal-times, good at play,
Good all night and good all day--
They shall have the pretty things
Merry Christmas always brings.

Naughty, romping girls and boys
Tear their clothes and make a noise,
Spoil their pinafores and frocks,
And deserve no Christmas-box.
Such as these shall never look
At this pretty Picture-book.
