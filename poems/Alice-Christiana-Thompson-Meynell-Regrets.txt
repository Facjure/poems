As, when the seaward ebbing tide doth pour
 Out by the low sand spaces,
The parting waves slip back to clasp the shore
 With lingering embraces,--

So in the tide of life that carries me
 From where thy true heart dwells,
Waves of my thoughts and memories turn to thee
 With lessening farewells;

Waving of hands; dreams, when the day forgets;
 A care half lost in cares;
The saddest of my verses; dim regrets;
 Thy name among my prayers.

I would the day might come, so waited for,
 So patiently besought,
When I, returning, should fill up once more
 Thy desolated thought;

And fill thy loneliness that lies apart
 In still, persistent pain.
Shall I content thee, O thou broken heart,
 As the tide comes again,

And brims the little sea-shore lakes, and sets
 Seaweeds afloat, and fills
The silent pools, rivers and rivulets
 Among the inland hills?
