title: Go, Winter!
---

Go, Winter!Go thy ways!We want again
The twitter of the bluebird and the wren;
Leaves ever greener growing, and the shine
Of Summer's sun - not thine. - 

Thy sun, which mocks our need of warmth and love
And all the heartening fervencies thereof,
It scarce hath heat enow to warm our thin
Pathetic yearnings in.

So get thee from us!We are cold, God wot,
Even as thou art. - We remember not
How blithe we hailed thy coming. - That was O
Too long - too long ago!

Get from us utterly!Ho!Summer then
Shall spread her grasses where thy snows have been,
And thy last icy footprint melt and mold
In her first marigold.
