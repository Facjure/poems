This morning, while we sat in talk
 Of spring and apple-bloom,
Lo!Death stood in the garden walk,
 And peered into the room.

Your back was turned, you did not see
 The shadow that he made.
He bent his head and looked at me;
 It made my soul afraid.

The words I had begun to speak
 Fell broken in the air.
You saw the pallor of my cheek,
 And turned--but none was there.

He came as sudden as a thought,
 And so departed too.
What made him leave his task unwrought?
 It was the sight of you.

Though Death but seldom turns aside
 From those he means to take,
He would not yet our hearts divide,
 For love and pity's sake.
