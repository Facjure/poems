title: Among The Green Bushes
---

 Among the green bushes the songs of the thrushes
 Are answering each other in music and glee,
 While the magpies and rooks, in woods, hedges, near brooks,
 Mount their Spring dwellings on every high tree.
 There meet me at eve, love, we'll on grassy banks lean love,
 And crop a white branch from the scented may tree,
 Where the silver brook wimples and the rosy cheek dimples,
 Sweet will the time of that courting hour be.

 We'll notice wild flowers, love, that grow by thorn bowers, love,
 Though sinful to crop them now beaded with dew;
 The violet is thine, love, the primrose is mine, love,
 To Spring and each other so blooming and true.
 With dewdrops all beaded, the feather grass seeded,
 The cloud mountains turn to dark woods in the sky;
 The daisy bud closes, while sleep the hedge roses;
 There's nothing seems wakeful but you love and I.

 Larks sleep in the rushes, linnets perch on the bushes,
 While mag's on her nest with her tail peeping out;
 The moon it reveals her, yet she thinks night conceals her,
 Though birdnesting boys are not roving about.
 The night winds won't wrong her, nor aught that belong her,
 For night is the nurse of all Nature in sleep;
 The moon, love, is keeping a watch o'er the sleeping,
 And dews for real pleasure do nothing but weep.

 Among the green bushes we'll sit with the thrushes,
 And blackbirds and linnets, an hour or two long,
 That are up at the dawning, by times in the morning,
 To cheer thee when milking with music and song.
 Then come at the eve, love, and where the banks lean, love,
 By the brook that flows on in its dribbles of song;
 While the moon looks so pale, love, and the trees look so hale, love,
 I will tell thee a tale, love, an hour or two long.
