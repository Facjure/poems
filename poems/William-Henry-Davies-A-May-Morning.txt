title: A May Morning
---

The sky is clear,
 The sun is bright;
The cows are red,
 The sheep are white;
Trees in the meadows
Make happy shadows.

Birds in the hedge
 Are perched and sing;
Swallows and larks
 Are on the wing:
Two merry cuckoos
Are making echoes.

Bird and the beast
 Have the dew yet;
My road shines dry,
 Theirs bright and wet:
Death gives no warning,
On this May morning.

I see no Christ
 Nailed on a tree,
Dying for sin;
 No sin I see:
No thoughts for sadness,
All thoughts for gladness.
