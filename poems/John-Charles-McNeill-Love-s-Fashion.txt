 Oh, I can jest with Margaret
And laugh a gay good-night,
 But when I take my Helen's hand
I dare not clasp it tight.

 I dare not hold her dear white hand
More than a quivering space,
 And I should bless a breeze that blew
Her hair into my face.

 'T is Margaret I call sweet names:
Helen is too, too dear
 For me to stammer little words
Of love into her ear.

 So now, good-night, fair Margaret,
And kiss me e'er we part!
 But one dumb touch of Helen's hand,
And, oh, my heart, my heart!
