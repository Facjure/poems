title: The Purpose
---

Over and over the task was set,
 Over and over I slighted the work,
But ever and alway I knew that yet
 I must face and finish the toil I shirk.

Over and over the whip of pain
 Has spurred and punished with blow on blow;
As ever and alway I tried in vain
 To shun the labour I hated so.

Over and over I came this way
 For just one purpose:O stubborn soul!
Turn with a will to your work to-day,
 And learn the lesson of SELF-CONTROL.
