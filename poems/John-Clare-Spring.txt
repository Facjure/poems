 Come, gentle Spring, and show thy varied greens
 In woods, and fields, and meadows, by clear brooks;
 Come, gentle Spring, and bring thy sweetest scenes,
 Where peace, with solitude, the loveliest looks;
 Where the blue unclouded sky
 Spreads the sweetest canopy,
 And Study wiser grows without her books.

 Come hither, gentle May, and with thee bring
 Flowers of all colours, and the wild briar rose;
 Come in wind-floating drapery, and bring
 Fragrance and bloom, that Nature's love bestows--
 Meadow pinks and columbines,
 Kecksies white and eglantines,
 And music of the bee that seeks the rose.

 Come, gentle Spring, and bring thy choicest looks,
 Thy bosom graced with flowers, thy face with smiles;
 Come, gentle Spring, and trace thy wandering brooks,
 Through meadow gates, o'er footpath crooked stiles;
 Come in thy proud and best array,
 April dews and flowers of May,
 And singing birds that come where heaven smiles.
