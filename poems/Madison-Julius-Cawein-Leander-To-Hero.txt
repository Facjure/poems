I.

 Brows wan thro' blue-black tresses
Wet with sharp rain and kisses;
 Locks loose the sea-wind scatters,
Like torn wings fierce for flight;
 Cold brows, whose sadness flatters,
One kiss and then - good-night.


II.

 Can this thy love undo me
When in the heavy waves?
 Nay; it must make unto me
Their groaning backs but slaves!
 For its magic doth indue me
With strength o'er all their graves.


III.

 Weep not as heavy-hearted
Before I go! For thou
 Wilt follow as we parted - 
 A something hollow-hearted,
 Dark eyes whence cold tears started,
 Gray, ghostly arms out-darted
To take me, even as now,
 To drag me, their weak lover,
 To caves where sirens hover,
 Deep caves the dark waves cover,
Down! throat and hair and brow.


IV.

 But in thy sleep shalt follow - 
Thy bosom fierce to mine,
 Long arms wound warm and hollow, - 
 In sleep, in sleep shalt follow, - 
To save me from the brine;
Dim eyes on mine divine;
Deep breath at mine like wine;
 Sweet thou, with dream-soft kisses
To dream me onward home,
 White in white foam that hisses,
Love's creature safe in foam.


V.

 What, Hero, else for weeping
 Than long, lost hours of sleeping
 And vestal-vestured Dreams,
 Where thy Leander stooping
 Sighs; no dead eyelids drooping;
 No harsh, hard looks accusing;
 No curls with ocean oozing;
 But then as now he seems,
Sweet-favored as can make him
 Thy smile, which is a might,
A hope, a god to take him
 Thro' all this hell of night.


VI.

 Then where thy breasts are hollow
One kiss! one kiss! I go!
 Sweet soul! a kiss to follow
 Up whence thy breasts bud hollow,
 Cheeks than wood-blossoms whiter,
 Eyes than dark waters brighter
Wherein the far stars glow.
 Look lovely when I leave thee! - 
I go, my love, I go!
 Look lovely, love, nor grieve thee,
That I must leave thee so.
