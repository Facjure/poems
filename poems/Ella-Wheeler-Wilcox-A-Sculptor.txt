title: A Sculptor.

 As the ambitious sculptor, tireless, lifts
 Chisel and hammer to the block at hand,
 Before my half-formed character I stand
 And ply the shining tools of mental gifts.
 I'll cut away a huge, unsightly side
 Of selfishness, and smooth to curves of grace
 The angles of ill-temper.

 And no trace
 Shall my sure hammer leave of silly pride.
 Chip after chip must fall from vain desires,
 And the sharp corners of my discontent
 Be rounded into symmetry, and lent
 Great harmony by faith that never tires.
 Unfinished still, I must toil on and on,
 Till the pale critic, Death, shall say, "'Tis done."
