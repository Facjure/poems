title: Wisdom. - Proverbs viii.22-31.
---

Ere God had built the mountains,
Or raised the fruitful hills;
Before he fill�d the fountains
That feed the running rills;
In me, from everlasting,
The wonderful I AM,
Found pleasures never-wasting,
And Wisdom is my name.


When, like a tent to dwell in,
He spread the skies abroad,
And swathed about the swelling
Of Ocean�s mighty flood;
He wrought by weight and measure,
And I was with him then:
Myself the Father�s pleasure,
And mine, the sons of men,


Thus Wisdom�s words discover
Thy glory and thy grace,
Thou everlasting lover
Of our unworthy race!
Thy gracious eye survey�d us
Ere stars were seen above;
In wisdom thou hast made us,
And died for us in love.


And couldst thou be delighted
With creatures such as we,
Who, when we saw thee, slighted
And nail�d thee to a tree?
Unfathomable wonder,
And mystery divine!
The voice that speaks in thunder,
Says, �Sinner, I am thine!�
