Tainted with death? Ah then, the taint is sweet!
As if God took the essences of life
And burned them in a brazier at his feet,
The smoke of them ascending rich and rife
To please his nostrils! What if man be loath
To your deep bosom, and would have the Spring
His bride forever! He who made you both
Knoweth your beauty for as fair a thing;
Like that of one who long hath been a wife.
And mothered men! As piercing as a knife,
And rich beyond all mortal imaging!
