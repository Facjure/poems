After the event the rockslide
realized,
in a still diversity of completion,
grain and fissure,
declivity
&amp;
force of upheaval,
whether rain slippage,
ice crawl, root
explosion or
stream erosive undercut:

well I said it is a pity:
one swath of sight will never
be the same: nonetheless,
this
shambles has
relived a bind, a taut of twist,
revealing streaks &amp;
scores of knowledge
now obvious and quiet.
