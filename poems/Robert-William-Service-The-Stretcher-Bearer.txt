title: The Stretcher-Bearer
---

 My stretcher is one scarlet stain,
 And as I tries to scrape it clean,
 I tell you wot - I'm sick with pain
 For all I've 'eard, for all I've seen;
 Around me is the 'ellish night,
 And as the war's red rim I trace,
 I wonder if in 'Eaven's height,
 Our God don't turn away 'Is Face.

 I don't care 'oose the Crime may be;
 I 'olds no brief for kin or clan;
 I 'ymns no 'ate: I only see
 As man destroys his brother man;
 I waves no flag: I only know,
 As 'ere beside the dead I wait,
 A million 'earts is weighed with woe,
 A million 'omes is desolate.

 In drippin' darkness, far and near,
 All night I've sought them woeful ones.
 Dawn shudders up and still I 'ear
 The crimson chorus of the guns.
 Look! like a ball of blood the sun
 'Angs o'er the scene of wrath and wrong. . . .
 "Quick! Stretcher-bearers on the run!"
 O PRINCE OF PEACE! 'OW LONG, 'OW LONG?
