And can you tell me Love is blind
Because your faults he will not find,
Because the image that he sees
Is one of splendid mysteries?
And if he lack the power to look
On what he will, as on a book,
And read therein the heart of it,
Why are his ways with wonder lit?
Why think you he should bind his eyes
And hide the many-tinted skies,
But that he sees too well to trust
The shadows on an orb of dust?
For he hath vision keener far
Than poring Thought�s and Fancy�s are
An inward vision, full and clear
When night has flung her mantle sheer
Across the world we stumble through
In search of Truth�s evasive clue.
He looks, and straight there fall away
The flutt�ring rags of your array,
The far-fet gem, th� indecent drape,
The pads that mar the perfect shape,
And naked to his reverent view
Is beauty�s self, essential you.
