An unkind tale was whispered in his ear.
 He paused to hear.
His thoughts were food that helped a falsehood thrive,
 And keep alive.

Years dawned and died.One day by venom's tongue
 His name was stung.
He cried aloud, nor dreamed the lie was spawn
 Of thoughts long gone.

Each mental wave we send out from the mind,
 Or base, or kind,
Completes its circuit, then with added force
 Seeks its own source.
