title: Marra To Bonney
---

What would you do wi' a doughter--
 Pray wi' her, bensil(1) her, flout her?--
Say, what would you do wi' a daughter
 That's marra to Bonney(2) hissen?

I prayed wi' her first, of a Sunday,
 When chapil was lowsin' for t' neet;
An' I laid all her cockaloft marlocks(3)
 'Fore th' Almighty's mercy-seat.
When I looked for her tears o' repentance,
 I jaloused(4) that I saw her laugh;
An' she said that t' Powers o' Justice
 Would scatter my words like chaff.

Then I bensilled her hard in her cham'er,
 As I bensils owd Neddy i' t' cart.
If prayers willent teach thee, my dolly,
 Happen whip-stock will mak thy tears start.
But she stood there as chuff as a mawmet,(5)
 Not one chunt'rin(6) word did she say:
But she hoped that t' blooid o' t' martyrs
 Would waish all my sins away.

Then I thought, mebbe floutin' will mend her;
 So I watched while she cam out o' t' mill,
And afore all yon Wyke lads an' lasses
 I fleered at her reight up our hill.
She winced when she heeard all their girnin',
 Then she whispered, a sob i' her throat:
"I reckon I'll noan think o' weddin'
 While women are given their vote."

What would you do wi' a doughter--
 Pray wi' her, bensil her, flout her?--
Say, what would you do wi' a daughter
 That's marra to Bonney hissen?
