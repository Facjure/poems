There is no summit you may not attain,
 No purpose which you may not yet achieve,
 If you will wait serenely and believe.
Each seeming loss is but a step to'rd gain.

Between the mountain-tops lie vale and plain;
 Let nothing make you question, doubt, or grieve;
 Give only good, and good alone receive;
And as you welcome joy, so welcome pain.

That which you most desire awaits your word;
 Throw wide the door and bid it enter in.
Speak, and the strong vibrations shall be stirred;
 Speak, and above earth's loud, unmeaning din
Your silent declarations shall be heard.
 All things are possible to God's own kin.
