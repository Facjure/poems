 The sorest ill that Heaven hath
 Sent on this lower world in wrath, - 
 The plague (to call it by its name,)
 One single day of which
 Would Pluto's ferryman enrich, - 
 Waged war on beasts, both wild and tame.
 They died not all, but all were sick:
 No hunting now, by force or trick,
 To save what might so soon expire.
 No food excited their desire;
 Nor wolf nor fox now watch'd to slay
 The innocent and tender prey.
 The turtles fled;
 So love and therefore joy were dead.
 The lion council held, and said:
 'My friends, I do believe
 This awful scourge, for which we grieve,
 Is for our sins a punishment
 Most righteously by Heaven sent.
 Let us our guiltiest beast resign,
 A sacrifice to wrath divine.
 Perhaps this offering, truly small,
 May gain the life and health of all.
 By history we find it noted
 That lives have been just so devoted.
 Then let us all turn eyes within,
 And ferret out the hidden sin.
 Himself let no one spare nor flatter,
 But make clean conscience in the matter.
 For me, my appetite has play'd the glutton
 Too much and often upon mutton.
 What harm had e'er my victims done?
 I answer, truly, None.
 Perhaps, sometimes, by hunger press'd,
 I've eat the shepherd with the rest.
 I yield myself, if need there be;
 And yet I think, in equity,
 Each should confess his sins with me;
 For laws of right and justice cry,
 The guiltiest alone should die.'
 'Sire,' said the fox, 'your majesty
 Is humbler than a king should be,
 And over-squeamish in the case.
 What! eating stupid sheep a crime?
 No, never, sire, at any time.
 It rather was an act of grace,
 A mark of honour to their race.
 And as to shepherds, one may swear,
 The fate your majesty describes,
 Is recompense less full than fair
 For such usurpers o'er our tribes.'

 Thus Renard glibly spoke,
 And loud applause from flatterers broke.
 Of neither tiger, boar, nor bear,
 Did any keen inquirer dare
 To ask for crimes of high degree;
 The fighters, biters, scratchers, all
 From every mortal sin were free;
 The very dogs, both great and small,
 Were saints, as far as dogs could be.

 The ass, confessing in his turn,
 Thus spoke in tones of deep concern: - 
 'I happen'd through a mead to pass;
 The monks, its owners, were at mass;
 Keen hunger, leisure, tender grass,
 And add to these the devil too,
 All tempted me the deed to do.
 I browsed the bigness of my tongue;
 Since truth must out, I own it wrong.'

 On this, a hue and cry arose,
 As if the beasts were all his foes:
 A wolf, haranguing lawyer-wise,
 Denounced the ass for sacrifice - 
 The bald-pate, scabby, ragged lout,
 By whom the plague had come, no doubt.
 His fault was judged a hanging crime.
 'What? eat another's grass? O shame!
 The noose of rope and death sublime,'
 For that offence, were all too tame!
 And soon poor Grizzle felt the same.

 Thus human courts acquit the strong,
 And doom the weak, as therefore wrong.
