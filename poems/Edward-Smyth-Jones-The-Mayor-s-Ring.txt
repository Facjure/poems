I hold a token in my hand,
A very tiny thing;
And yet within its golden band
A thousand memories cling.

Aye! thrice ten thousand memories cling
Of signal victories won,
Enshrined within this little ring,
Reward of duty done.

I ever shall this token prize,
And wear it with true grace - 
The tie that binds the kindred ties
Of friendship race to race.

And when I soar full through the skies,
Yet ever will I cling
Within the gates of Paradise
This sacred little ring!
