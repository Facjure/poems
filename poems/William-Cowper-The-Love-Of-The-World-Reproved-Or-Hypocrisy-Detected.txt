Thus says the prophet of the Turk,
Good Mussulman, abstain from pork;
There is a part in every swine
No friend of follower of mine
May taste, whate�er his inclination,
On pain of excommunication.
Such Mahomet�s mysterious charge,
And thus he left the point at large.
Had he the sinful part express�d,
They might with safety eat the rest;
But for one piece they thought it hard
From the whole hog to be debarr�d;
And set their wit at work to find
What joint the prophet had in mind.
Much controversy straight arose,
These choose the back, the belly those;
By some �tis confidently said
He meant not to forbid the head;
While others at that doctrine rail,
And piously prefer the tail.
Thus, conscience freed from every clog,
Mahometans eat up the hog.
You laugh��tis well�the tale applied
May make you laugh on t�other side.
Renounce the world�the preacher cries.
We do�a multitude replies.
While one as innocent regards
A snug and friendly game at cards;
And one, whatever you may say,
Can see no evil in a play;
Some love a concert, or a race;
And others shooting, and the chase.
Reviled and loved, renounced and follow�d,
Thus, bit by bit, the world is swallow�d;
Each thinks his neighbour makes too free,
Yet likes a slice as well as he:
With sophistry their sauce they sweeten,
Till quite from tail to snout �tis eaten.
