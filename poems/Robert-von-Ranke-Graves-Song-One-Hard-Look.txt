title: Song: One Hard Look.
---


 Small gnats that fly
 In hot July
 And lodge in sleeping ears,
 Can rouse therein
 A trumpet's din
 With Day-of-Judgement fears.

 Small mice at night
 Can wake more fright
 Than lions at midday.
 An urchin small
 Torments us all
 Who tread his prickly way.

 A straw will crack
 The camel's back,
 To die we need but sip,
 So little sand
 As fills the hand
 Can stop a steaming ship.

 One smile relieves
 A heart that grieves
 Though deadly sad it be,
 And one hard look
 Can close the book
 That lovers love to see,
