Sombre November, least belov'd of all
 The months that make the pleasurable year,
Too late for the resplendence of the fall,
 Too soon for Christmas-bringing winter's cheer;
Ignoble interregnum following
 The golden cycle of a good queen's reign,
Before her heir, proclaimed already king,
 Has come of age to rule in her domain;

We do not praise you; many a dreary day
 Impatiently we chide your laggard pace;
Backward we look, and forward, and we say:
 The queen was kind and fair of form and face;
The king is stern, but clad in brave array:
 God save His Majesty and send him grace.
