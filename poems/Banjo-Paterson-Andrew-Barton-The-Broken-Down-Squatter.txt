title: The Broken-Down Squatter

 (Air: �It�s a fine hunting day.�)


Come, Stumpy, old man, we must shift while we can;
All our mates in the paddock are dead.
Let us wave our farewells to Glen Eva�s sweet dells
And the hills where your lordship was bred;
Together to roam from our drought-stricken home�
It seems hard that such things have to be,
And its hard on a �hogs� when he�s nought for a boss
But a broken-down squatter like me!

Chorus

 For the banks are all broken, they say,
 And the merchants are all up a tree.
 When the bigwigs are brought to the Bankruptcy Court,
 What chance for a squatter like me.

No more shall we muster the river for fats,
Or spiel on the Fifteen-mile plain,
Or rip through the scrub by the light of the moon,
Or see the old stockyard again.

Leave the slip-panels down, it won�t matter much now,
There are none but the crows left to see,
Perching gaunt in yon pine, as though longing to dine
On a broken-down squatter like me.

 Chorus: For the banks, &amp;c.

When the country was cursed with the drought at its worst,
And the cattle were dying in scores,
Though down on my luck, I kept up my pluck,
Thinking justice might temper the laws.
But the farce has been played, and the Government aid
Ain�t extended to squatters, old son;
When my dollars were spent they doubled the rent,
And resumed the best half of the run.

 Chorus: For the banks, &amp;c.

�Twas done without reason, for leaving the season
No squatter could stand such a rub;
For it�s useless to squat when the rents are so hot
That one can�t save the price of one�s grub;
And there�s not much to choose �twixt the banks and the Jews
Once a fellow gets put up a tree;
No odds what I feel, there�s no court of appeal
For a broken-down squatter like me.

 Chorus: For the banks, &amp;c.
