title: No Beer, No Work
---

The shades of night was fallin� slow
As through New York a guy did go
And nail on ev�ry barroom door
A card that this here motter bore:
�No beer, no work.�

His brow was sad, his mouth was dry;
It was the first day of July,
And where, all parched and scorched it hung,
These words was stenciled on his tongue:
�No beer, no work.�

�Oh, stay,� the maiden said, �and sup
This malted milk from this here cup.�
A shudder passed through that there guy,
But with a moan he made reply:
�No beer, no work.�

At break of day, as through the town
The milkman put milk bottles down,
Onto one stoop a sort of snore
Was heard, and then was heard no more,
�No beer, no work.�

The poor old guy plumb dead was found
And planted in the buryin� ground,
Still graspin� in his hand of ice
Them placards with this sad device:
�No beer, no work.�
