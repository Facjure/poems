 This is the month the nightingale, clod brown,
 Is heard among the woodland shady boughs:
 This is the time when in the vale, grass-grown,
 The maiden hears at eve her lover's vows,
 What time the blue mist round the patient cows
 Dim rises from the grass and half conceals
 Their dappled hides. I hear the nightingale,
 That from the little blackthorn spinney steals
 To the old hazel hedge that skirts the vale,
 And still unseen sings sweet. The ploughman feels
 The thrilling music as he goes along,
 And imitates and listens; while the fields
 Lose all their paths in dusk to lead him wrong,
 Still sings the nightingale her soft melodious song.
