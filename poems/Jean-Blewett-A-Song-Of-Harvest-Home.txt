title: A Song Of Harvest Home.
---

Praise God for blessings great and small,
 For garden bloom and orchard store,
The crimson vine upon the wall,
The green and gold of maples tall,
 For harvest-field and threshing-floor!

Praise God for children's laughter shrill,
 For clinging hands and tender eyes,
For looks that lift and words that thrill,
For friends that love through good and ill,
 For home, and all home's tender ties!

Praise God for losses and for gain,
 For tears to shed, and songs to sing,
For gleams of gold and mists of rain,
For the year's full joy, the year's deep pain,
 The grieving and the comforting!
