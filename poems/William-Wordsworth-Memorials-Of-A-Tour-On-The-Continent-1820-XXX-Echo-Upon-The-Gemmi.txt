---

 What beast of chase hath broken from the cover?
 Stern Gemmi listens to as full a cry,
 As multitudinous a harmony
 Of sounds as rang the heights of Latmos over,
 When, from the soft couch of her sleeping Lover,
 Up-starting, Cynthia skimmed the mountain dew
 In keen pursuit, and gave, where'er she flew,
 Impetuous motion to the Stars above her.
 A solitary Wolf-dog, ranging on
 Through the bleak concave, wakes this wondrous chime
 Of aery voices locked in unison,
 Faint, far-off, near, deep, solemn and sublime!
 So, from the body of one guilty deed,
 A thousand ghostly fears, and haunting thoughts, proceed!
