title: The World And The Quietist

Why, when the World�s great mind
Hath finally inclin�d,
Why, you say, Critias, be debating still?
Why, with these mournful rhymes
Learn�d in more languid climes,
Blame our activity,
Who, with such passionate will,
Are, what we mean to be?

Critias, long since, I know,
(For Fate decreed it so,)
Long since the World hath set its heart to live.
Long since with credulous zeal
It turns Life�s mighty wheel;
Still doth for labourers send,
Who still their labour give;
And still expects an end.

Yet, as the wheel flies round,
With no ungrateful sound
Do adverse voices fall on the World�s ear.
Deafen�d by his own stir
The rugged Labourer
Caught not till then a sense
So glowing and so near
Of his omnipotence.

So, when the feast grew loud
In Susa�s palace proud,
A white-rob�d slave stole to the Monarch�s side.
He spoke: the Monarch heard:
Felt the slow-rolling word
Swell his attentive soul.
Breath�d deeply as it died,
And drain�d his mighty bowl.
