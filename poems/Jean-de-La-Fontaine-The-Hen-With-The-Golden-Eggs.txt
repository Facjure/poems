[1]

 How avarice loseth all,
 By striving all to gain,
 I need no witness call
 But him whose thrifty hen,
 As by the fable we are told,
 Laid every day an egg of gold.
 'She hath a treasure in her body,'
 Bethinks the avaricious noddy.
 He kills and opens - vexed to find
 All things like hens of common kind.
 Thus spoil'd the source of all his riches,
 To misers he a lesson teaches.
 In these last changes of the moon,
 How often doth one see
 Men made as poor as he
 By force of getting rich too soon!
