title: I Must Not Be Selfish.
---

When I play with little children
I must very gentle be;
I must always do to others
As I'd have them do to me.

I must like to give and lend them,
If they want my prettiest toy;
More than my delight and pleasure
I must love my playmate's joy.

Children who are kind and loving
God above is pleased to see;
Let me ever this remember,
Ever sweet and pleasant be.
