A fair young girl was to the altar led
By him she loved, the chosen of her heart;
And words of solemn import there were said,
And mutual vows were pledged till death should part.

But life was young, and death a great way off,
At least it seemed so then, on that bright morn;
And they no doubt, expected years of bliss,
And in their path the rose without a thorn.

Cherished from infancy with tenderest care,
A precious only daughter was the bride;
And when that young protector's arm she took,
She for the first time left her parents' side.

With all a woman's tender, trustful heart,
She gave herself away to him she loved;
Why should she not, was he not all her own,
A choice by friends and parents too approved?

How rapidly with him the days now fly,
With him the partner of her future life;
Happy and joyous as a child she'd been,
Happy as daughter, happier still as wife.

But ere eight months in quick succession passed,
One to each human heart a dreaded foe,
Entered her house, and by a single stroke,
Blasted her hopes, and laid her idol low.

Three months of bitter anguish was endured,
But hope again revived, and she was blest,
When pressing to her heart a darling child,
Whose little head she pillowed on her breast.

Not long is she permitted to enjoy,
This sweetest bud of promise to her given;
Short as an angel's visit was its stay,
When God, who gave it, took it up to heaven.

Ah, what a contrast one short year presents!
Replete with happiness - replete with woe;
In that brief space, a maiden called, and wife,
Widow and mother written - childless too.

Surely my friend, I need not say to thee,
Look not to earth for what it can't bestow;
'Tis at the best a frail and brittle reed,
Which trusting for support, will pierce thee through.

Then let us look above this fleeting earth,
To heaven and heavenly joys direct our eyes;
No lasting happiness this world affords - 
"He builds too low who builds below the skies."

Weston, Dec. 1, 1852.
