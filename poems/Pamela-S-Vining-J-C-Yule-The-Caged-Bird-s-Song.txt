Merrily!
Merrily!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
What can the meaning of these things be?
Tiniest buds and leaflets green - 
Who shall tell me what these things mean?
Merrily!
Merrily!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
Much I guess they were meant for me!

Tsu-ert!
Tsu-ert!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
So I shall eat them up you see
Somebody, somewhere, is kindly stirred
To think of me, a poor, brown bird! - 
Merrily!
Merrily!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
Somebody, somewhere, thinks of me!

Tsu-ert!
Tsu-ert!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
"A gentle lady?" - and can it be? - 
Say it again, 'tis a pleasant word,
Thinking of me, your poor, brown bird! - 
Merrily!
Merrily!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
Bless the lady that thinks of me

Tsu-ert!
Tsu-ert!
 Tschee: tschee! tschee!
So I shall eat them up, you see!
Hi, a nip here! and ho, a nip there!
Bless me, mistress, how sweet they are!
Merrily!
Merrily!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
Bless the lady who thinks of me!

Tsu-ert!
Tsu-ert!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
Merrily, merrily, let it be! - 
Hi, a nip here! and ho, a nip there!
Over, under, everywhere!
Merrily!
Merrily!
 Tschee! tschee! tschee!
Somebody, somewhere, thinks of me!
