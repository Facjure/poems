---

	 In fairyland the little boys
	 Would rather fight than eat their meals.
	 They like to chase a gauze-winged fly
	 And catch and beat him till he squeals.
	 Sometimes they come to sleeping men
	 Armed with the deadly red-rose thorn,
	 And those that feel its fearful wound
	 Repent the day that they were born.
