Farewell! endued with all that could engage
All hearts to love thee, both in youth and age!
In prime of life, for sprightliness enroll�d
Among the gay, yet virtuous as the old;


In life�s last stage (O blessings rarely found!),
Pleasant as youth with all its blossoms crown�d;
Through every period of this changeful state
Unchanged thyself�wise, good, affectionate!


Marble may flatter, and lest this should seem
O�ercharged with praises on so dear a theme,
Although thy worth be more than half supprest,
Love shall be satisfied, and veil the rest.
