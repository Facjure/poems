Star! Star, why dost thou shine
 Each night upon my brow?
Why dost thou make me dream the dreams
 That I am dreaming now?

Star! Star, thy home is high --
 I am of humble birth;
Thy feet walk shining o'er the sky,
 Mine, only on the earth.

Star! Star, why make me dream?
 My dreams are all untrue;
And why is sorrow dark for me
 And heaven bright for you?

Star! Star, oh, hide thy ray,
 And take it off my face;
Within my lowly home I stay,
 Thou, in thy lofty place.

Star! Star, and still I dream,
 Along thy light afar
I seem to soar until I seem
 To be, like you, a star.
