There was a little man,
And he had a little gun,
And he went to the brook,
And he shot a little rook;
And he took it home
To his old wife Joan,
And told her to make up a fire,
While he went back,
To fetch the little drake;
But when he got there,
The drake was fled for fear,
And like an old novice,
He turn'd back again.
