 I'm a tough old salt, and it's never I care
A penny which way the wind is,
 Or whether I sight Cape Finisterre,
Or make a port at the Indies.

 Some folks steer for a port to trade,
And some steer north for the whaling;
 Yet never I care a damn just where
I sail, so long's I'm sailing.

 You never can stop the wind when it blows,
And you can't stop the rain from raining;
 Then why, oh, why, go a-piping of your eye
When there's no sort o' use in complaining?

 My face is browned and my lungs are sound,
And my hands they are big and calloused.
 I've a little brown jug I sometimes hug,
And a little bread and meat for ballast.

 But I keep no log of my daily grog,
For what's the use o' being bothered?
 I drink a little more when the wind's offshore,
And most when the wind's from the no'th'ard.

 Of course with a chill if I'm took quite ill,
And my legs get weak and toddly,
 At the jug I pull, and turn in full,
And sleep the sleep of the godly.

 But whether I do or whether I don't,
Or whether the jug's my failing,
 It's never I care a damn just where
I sail, so long's I'm sailing.
