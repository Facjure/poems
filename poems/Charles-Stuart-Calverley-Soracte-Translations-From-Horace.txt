OD. i. 9.


One dazzling mass of solid snow
 Soracte stands; the bent woods fret
 Beneath their load; and, sharpest-set
With frost, the streams have ceased to flow.

Pile on great faggots and break up
 The ice: let influence more benign
 Enter with four-years-treasured wine,
Fetched in the ponderous Sabine cup:

Leave to the Gods all else. When they
 Have once bid rest the winds that war
 Over the passionate seas, no more
Grey ash and cypress rock and sway.

Ask not what future suns shall bring,
 Count to-day gain, whate'er it chance
 To be: nor, young man, scorn the dance,
Nor deem sweet Love an idle thing,

Ere Time thy April youth hath changed
 To sourness. Park and public walk
 Attract thee now, and whispered talk
At twilight meetings pre-arranged;

Hear now the pretty laugh that tells
 In what dim corner lurks thy love;
 And snatch a bracelet or a glove
From wrist or hand that scarce rebels.
