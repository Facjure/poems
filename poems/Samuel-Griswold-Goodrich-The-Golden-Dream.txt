In midnight dreams the Wizard came,
 And beckoned me away 
With tempting hopes of wealth and fame,
 He cheered my lonely way.
He led me o'er a dusky heath,
 And there a river swept,
Whose gay and glassy tide beneath,
 Uncounted treasure, slept.
The wooing ripples lightly dashed
 Around the cherished store,
And circling eddies brightly flashed
 Above the yellow ore.
I bent me o'er the deep smooth stream,
 And plunged the gold to get, 
But oh! it vanished with my dream 
 And I got dripping wet!
O'er lonely heath and darksome hill,
 As shivering home I went,
The mocking Wizard whispered shrill,
 'Thou'dst better been content!'
