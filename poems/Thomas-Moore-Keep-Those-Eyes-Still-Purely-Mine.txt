title: Keep Those Eyes Still Purely Mine.
---


Keep those eyes still purely mine,
Tho' far off I be:
When on others most they shine,
Then think they're turned on me.

Should those lips as now respond
To sweet minstrelsy,
When their accents seem most fond,
Then think they're breathed for me.

Make what hearts thou wilt thy own,
If when all on thee
Fix their charmed thoughts alone,
Thou think'st the while on me.
