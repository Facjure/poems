title: Great Things
---

Sweet cyder is a great thing,
 A great thing to me,
Spinning down to Weymouth town
 By Ridgway thirstily,
And maid and mistress summoning
 Who tend the hostelry:
O cyder is a great thing,
 A great thing to me!

The dance it is a great thing,
 A great thing to me,
With candles lit and partners fit
 For night-long revelry;
And going home when day-dawning
 Peeps pale upon the lea:
O dancing is a great thing,
 A great thing to me!

Love is, yea, a great thing,
 A great thing to me,
When, having drawn across the lawn
 In darkness silently,
A figure flits like one a-wing
 Out from the nearest tree:
O love is, yes, a great thing,
 A great thing to me!

Will these be always great things,
 Great things to me? . . .
Let it befall that One will call,
 "Soul, I have need of thee:"
What then? Joy-jaunts, impassioned flings,
 Love, and its ecstasy,
Will always have been great things,
 Great things to me!
