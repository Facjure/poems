title: All is well
---

Whate�er you dream with doubt possest,
Keep, keep it snug within your breast,
And lay you down and take your rest;
Forget in sleep the doubt and pain,
And when you wake, to work again.
The wind it blows, the vessel goes,
And where and whither, no one knows.

�Twill all be well: no need of care;
Though how it will, and when, and where,
We cannot see, and can�t declare.
In spite of dreams, in spite of thought,
�Tis not in vain, and not for nought,
The wind it blows, the ship it goes,
Though where and whither, no one knows.
