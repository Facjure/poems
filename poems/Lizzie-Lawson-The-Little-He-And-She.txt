Once there lived, I'm not sure where,
May be Arcadee,
Sweet-Heart and his mistress fair,
Little He and She;

And they danced a measure light,
Danced in very glee.
Hand in hand, a pretty sight,
Little He and She.

When they ceased his bright eyes fell,
Darling must we stay?
Can't we dance so happily
You and I for aye?

Then she clasped his hand again,
Whispered sweet and low,
"Dearest, always hand in hand
You and I will go."

So they danced with merry feet,
E'en in Arcadee,
Happier pair you ne'er will meet,
Little He and She.
