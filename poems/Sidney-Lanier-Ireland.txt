Written for the Art Autograph during the Irish Famine, 1880.



Heartsome Ireland, winsome Ireland,
Charmer of the sun and sea,
Bright beguiler of old anguish,
How could Famine frown on thee?

As our Gulf-Stream, drawn to thee-ward,
Turns him from his northward flow,
And our wintry western headlands
Send thee summer from their snow,

Thus the main and cordial current
Of our love sets over sea, -
Tender, comely, valiant Ireland,
Songful, soulful, sorrowful Ireland, -
Streaming warm to comfort thee.


Baltimore, 1880.
