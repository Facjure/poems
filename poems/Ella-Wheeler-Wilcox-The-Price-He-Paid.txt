title: The Price He Paid
---

I said I would have my fling,
 And do what a young man may;
And I didn't believe a thing
 That the parsons have to say.
I didn't believe in a God
 That gives us blood like fire,
Then flings us into hell because
 We answer the call of desire.

And I said:'Religion is rot,
 And the laws of the world are nil;
For the bad man is he who is caught
 And cannot foot his bill.
And there is no place called hell;
 And heaven is only a truth
When a man has his way with a maid,
 In the fresh keen hour of youth.

'And money can buy us grace,
 If it rings on the plate of the church:
And money can neatly erase
 Each sign of a sinful smirch.'
For I saw men everywhere,
 Hotfooting the road of vice;
And women and preachers smiled on them
 As long as they paid the price.

So I had my joy of life:
 I went the pace of the town;
And then I took me a wife,
 And started to settle down.
I had gold enough and to spare
 For all of the simple joys
That belong with a house and a home
 And a brood of girls and boys.

I married a girl with health
 And virtue and spotless fame.
I gave in exchange my wealth
 And a proud old family name.
And I gave her the love of a heart
 Grown sated and sick of sin!
My deal with the devil was all cleaned up,
 And the last bill handed in.

She was going to bring me a child,
 And when in labour she cried
With love and fear I was wild - 
 But now I wish she had died.
For the son she bore me was blind
 And crippled and weak and sore!
And his mother was left a wreck.
 It was so she settled my score.

I said I must have my fling,
 And they knew the path I would go;
Yet no one told me a thing
 Of what I needed to know.
Folks talk too much of a soul
 From heavenly joys debarred - 
And not enough of the babes unborn,
 By the sins of their fathers scarred.
