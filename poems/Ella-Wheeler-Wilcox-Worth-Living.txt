I know not what the future may hold,
 Or how to others it seems,
But I know my skies have held more gold
 Than I used to find in my dreams.

Though the whole world sings of hopes death chilled,
 In grateful truth I say,
That my best hopes have been fulfilled,
 And more than fulfilled to-day.

Though oft my arrow I aim at the sun
 To see it fall into the sand,
Yet just as often some work I have done
 Is better than I have planned.

I do not always grasp the pleasure
 For which I reach, maybe;
But quite as frequently over-measure
 Is given by joy to me.

To-morrow may bring a grief behind it
 That will thoroughly change my mood;
But we only can speak of a thing as we find it -
 And I have found life good.
