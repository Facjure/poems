 * The French "Tommy".



 Oh, some of us lolled in the chateau,
 And some of us slinked in the slum;
 But now we are here with a song and a cheer
 To serve at the sign of the drum.
 They put us in trousers of scarlet,
 In big sloppy ulsters of blue;
 In boots that are flat, a box of a hat,
 And they call us the little piou-piou,
Piou-piou,
 The laughing and quaffing piou-piou,
 The swinging and singing piou-piou;
 And so with a rattle we march to the battle,
 The weary but cheery piou-piou.

Encore un petit verre de vin,
Pour nous mettre en route;
Encore un petit verre de vin
Pour nous mettre en train.

 They drive us head-on for the slaughter;
 We haven't got much of a chance;
 The issue looks bad, but we're awfully glad
 To battle and die for La France.
 For some must be killed, that is certain;
 There's only one's duty to do;
 So we leap to the fray in the glorious way
 They expect of the little piou-piou.
En avant!
 The way of the gallant piou-piou,
 The dashing and smashing piou-piou;
 The way grim and gory that leads us to glory
 Is the way of the little piou-piou.

Allons, enfants de la Patrie,
Le jour de gloire est arriv�.

 To-day you would scarce recognise us,
 Such veterans war-wise are we;
 So grimy and hard, so calloused and scarred,
 So "crummy", yet gay as can be.
 We've finished with trousers of scarlet,
 They're giving us breeches of blue,
 With a helmet instead of a cap on our head,
 Yet still we're the little piou-piou.
Nous les aurons!
 The jesting, unresting piou-piou;
 The cheering, unfearing piou-piou;
 The keep-your-head-level and fight-like-the-devil;
 The dying, defying piou-piou.

� la bayonette! Jusqu'� la mort!
Sonnez la charge, clairons!
