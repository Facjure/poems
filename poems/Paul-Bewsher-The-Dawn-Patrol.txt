Sometimes I fly at dawn above the sea,
Where, underneath, the restless waters flow - 
 Silver, and cold, and slow.
Dim in the East there burns a new-born sun,
Whose rosy gleams along the ripples run,
 Save where the mist droops low,
Hiding the level loneliness from me.

And now appears beneath the milk-white haze
A little fleet of anchored ships, which lie
 In clustered company,
And seem as they are yet fast bound by sleep,
Although the day has long begun to peep,
 With red-inflamï¿½d eye,
Along the still, deserted ocean ways.

The fresh, cold wind of dawn blows on my face
As in the sun's raw heart I swiftly fly,
 And watch the seas glide by.
Scarce human seem I, moving through the skies,
And far removed from warlike enterprise - 
 Like some great gull on high
Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space.

Then do I feel with God quite, quite alone,
High in the virgin morn, so white and still,
 And free from human ill:
My prayers transcend my feeble earth-bound plaints - 
As though I sang among the happy Saints
 With many a holy thrill - 
As though the glowing sun were God's bright Throne.

My flight is done. I cross the line of foam
That breaks around a town of grey and red,
 Whose streets and squares lie dead
Beneath the silent dawn - then am I proud
That England's peace to guard I am allowed; - 
 Then bow my humble head,
In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.

 Luxeuil-les-Bains, 1917.
