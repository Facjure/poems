title: I Have Some Friends
---

 I have some friends, some worthy friends,
 And worthy friends are rare:
 These carpet slippers on my feet,
 That padded leather chair;
 This old and shabby dressing-gown,
 So well the worse of wear.

 I have some friends, some honest friends,
 And honest friends are few;
 My pipe of briar, my open fire,
 A book that's not too new;
 My bed so warm, the nights of storm
 I love to listen to.

 I have some friends, some good, good friends,
 Who faithful are to me:
 My wrestling partner when I rise,
 The big and burly sea;
 My little boat that's riding there
 So saucy and so free.

 I have some friends, some golden friends,
 Whose worth will not decline:
 A tawny Irish terrier, a purple shading pine,
 A little red-roofed cottage that
 So proudly I call mine.

 All other friends may come and go,
 All other friendships fail;
 But these, the friends I've worked to win,
 Oh, they will never stale;
 And comfort me till Time shall write
 The finish to my tale.
