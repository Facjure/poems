 There are no colours in the fairest sky
 So fair as these. The feather, whence the pen
 Was shaped that traced the lives of these good men,
 Dropped from an Angel's wing. With moistened eye
 We read of faith and purest charity
 In Statesman, Priest, and humble Citizen:
 Oh could we copy their mild virtues, then
 What joy to live, what blessedness to die!
 Methinks their very names shine still and bright;
 Apart like glow-worms on a summer night;
 Or lonely tapers when from far they fling
 A guiding ray; or seen like stars on high,
 Satellites burning in a lucid ring
 Around meek Walton's heavenly memory.
