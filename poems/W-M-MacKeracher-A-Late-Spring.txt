title: A Late Spring.
---

Twelve weeks had passed - how slowly! - day by day,
 Since formal, dull Sir Calendar had bowed
Old Winter from the scene, and cried, "Make way!
 The Spring, the Spring!" and still a sullen cloud
Obscured the sky, and the north wind blew chill;
 When lo, one morn the miracle began;
A Presence brooded over vale and hill,
 And through all life a quickening impulse ran.

Long-hushed, forgotten melodies awoke
 Within my soul; the rapture of the boy
Refilled me; o'er my arid being broke
 A brimming tide of elemental joy
From primal deeps; and all my happy springs
Came back to me - I was the peer of kings!
