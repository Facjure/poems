 Here comes The Flag!
 Hail it!
 Who dares to drag
 Or trail it?
 Give it hurrahs, - 
 Three for the stars,
 Three for the bars.
 Uncover your head to it!
 The soldiers who tread to it
 Shout at the sight of it,
 The justice and right of it,
 The unsullied white of it,
 The blue and red of it,
 And tyranny's dread of it!

 Here comes The Flag!
 Cheer it!
 Valley and crag
 Shall hear it.
 Fathers shall bless it,
 Children caress it.
 All shall maintain it.
 No one shall stain it,
 Cheers for the sailors that fought on the wave for it,
 Cheers for the soldiers that always were brave for it,
 Tears for the men that went down to the grave for it!
 Here comes The Flag!
