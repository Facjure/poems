title: Do Not Worry
---

Do not worry over trifles, though
to you they may seem great,
All your fretting will not help you,
or your troubles dissipate.

If your sky is dark and gloomy,
and the sun is hid from view,
Bravely smile and keep on smiling,
And your friends will smile with you.

Happiness is so contagious, and a
smile is never lost;
Then why worry over trifles, tho
your heart seems tempest tossed.

Therefore go on life's journey
with an optimistic smile,
See the world is good to live in,
and that living is worth while.
