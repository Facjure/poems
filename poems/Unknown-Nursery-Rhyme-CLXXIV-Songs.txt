There was a man in our toone, in our toone, in our toone,
There was a man in our toone, and his name was Billy Pod;
And he played upon an old razor, an old razor, an old razor,
And he played upon an old razor, with my fiddle fiddle fe fum fo.

And his hat it was made of the good roast beef, the good roast beef, the good roast beef,
And his hat it was made of the good roast beef, and his name was Billy Pod;
And he played upon an old razor, &amp; c.

And his coat it was made of the good fat tripe, the good fat tripe, the good fat tripe,
And his coat it was made of the good fat tripe, and his name was Billy Pod;
And he played upon an old razor, &amp; c.

And his breeks were made of the bawbie baps, the bawbie baps, the bawbie baps,
And his breeks were made of the bawbie baps, and his name was Billy Pod;
And he played upon an old razor, &amp; c.

And there was a man in tither toone, in tither toone, in tither toone,
And there was a man in tither toone, and his name was Edrin Drum;
And he played upon an old laadle, an old laadle, an old laadle,
And he played upon an old laadle, with my fiddle fiddle fe fum fo.

And he eat up all the good roast beef, the good roast beef, &amp; c. &amp; c.
And he eat up all the good fat tripe, the good fat tripe, &amp; c. &amp; c.
And he eat up all the bawbie baps, &amp; c. and his name was Edrin Drum.
