title: Golden Days.

There are days of summer sunshine,
Of warm and sunny weather,
When the hedge is full of hawthorn
And hills are glad with heather.

There are days of silent sadness,
Of frost, and snow, and rain,
When we fear that summer's gladness
Will never come again.

And now our songs are minor key,
And now in merry tune;
The windward side will change to lee,
And January to June.

Day and night the sun is shining,
Though he may hide his head;
Each cloud has a silver lining,
The flowers are asleep not dead.

Every day may have its playtime
Made bright by cheerful lays;
And life be one long Maytime,
A year of golden days.
