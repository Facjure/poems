 Shrieks out of smoke, a flame of dung-straw fire
That is not quenched but hath for only fruit
What writhes and dies not in its rotten root:
 Two things made flesh, the visible desire
 To match in filth the skunk, the ape in ire, {87a}
Mouthing before the mirrors with wild foot
Beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit,
 The perfect twanger of the Chinese lyre!
 A heart with generous virtues run to seed
 In vices making all a jumbled creed:
A soul that knows not love nor trust nor shame,
 But cuts itself with knives to bawl and bleed - 
If thou we've known of late, art still the same,
What need, O soul, to sign thee with thy name?

 Once on thy lips the golden-honeyed bees
Settling made sweet the heart that was not strong,
And sky and earth and sea burst into song: {87b}
 Once on thine eyes the light of agonies
 Flashed through the soul and robbed the days of ease. {87c}
But tunes turn stale when love turns babe, and long
The exiled gentlemen grow fat with wrong.
 And peasants, workmen, beggars, what are these? {87d}
 O you who sang the Italian smoke above, - 
Mud-lark of Freedom, pipe of that vile band
 Whose envy slays the tyrant, not the love
 Of these poor souls none have the keeping of - 
It is your hand - it is your pandar hand
Smites the bruised mouth of pilloried Ireland!
