 Whoever was begotten by pure love,
 And came desired and welcome into life,
 Is of immaculate conception. He
 Whose heart is full of tenderness and truth,
 Who loves mankind more than he loves himself,
 And cannot find room in his heart for hate,
 May be another Christ. We all may be
 The Saviours of the world if we believe
 In the Divinity which dwells in us
 And worship it, and nail our grosser selves,
 Our tempers, greeds, and our unworthy aims,
 Upon the cross. Who giveth love to all;
 Pays kindness for unkindness, smiles for frowns;
 And lends new courage to each fainting heart,
 And strengthens hope and scatters joy abroad - 
 He, too, is a Redeemer, Son of God.
