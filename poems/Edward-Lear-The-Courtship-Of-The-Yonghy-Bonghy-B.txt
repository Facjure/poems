I.

On the Coast of Coromandel
Where the early pumpkins blow,
In the middle of the woods
Lived the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
Two old chairs, and half a candle,
One old jug without a handle, - 
These were all his worldly goods:
In the middle of the woods,
These were all the worldly goods
Of the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
Of the Yonghy-Bonghy B�.


II.

Once, among the Bong-trees walking
Where the early pumpkins blow,
To a little heap of stones
Came the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
There he heard a Lady talking,
To some milk-white Hens of Dorking, - 
"'Tis the Lady Jingly Jones!
On that little heap of stones
Sits the Lady Jingly Jones!"
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.


III.

"Lady Jingly! Lady Jingly!
Sitting where the pumpkins blow,
Will you come and be my wife?"
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
"I am tired of living singly - 
On this coast so wild and shingly, - 
I'm a-weary of my life;
If you'll come and be my wife,
Quite serene would be my life!"
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.


IV.

"On this Coast of Coromandel
Shrimps and watercresses grow,
Prawns are plentiful and cheap,"
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
"You shall have my chairs and candle,
And my jug without a handle!
Gaze upon the rolling deep
(Fish is plentiful and cheap);
As the sea, my love is deep!"
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.


V.

Lady Jingly answered sadly,
And her tears began to flow, - 
"Your proposal comes too late,
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!
I would be your wife most gladly!"
(Here she twirled her fingers madly,)
"But in England I've a mate!
Yes! you've asked me far too late,
For in England I've a mate,
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!


VI.

"Mr. Jones (his name is Handel, - 
Handel Jones, Esquire, &amp; Co.)
Dorking fowls delights to send,
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!
Keep, oh, keep your chairs and candle,
And your jug without a handle, - 
I can merely be your friend!
Should my Jones more Dorkings send,
I will give you three, my friend!
Mr. Yonghy-Bongy-B�!
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!


VII.

"Though you've such a tiny body,
And your head so large doth grow, - 
Though your hat may blow away,
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!
Though you're such a Hoddy Doddy,
Yet I wish that I could modi-
fy the words I needs must say!
Will you please to go away?
That is all I have to say,
Mr. Yongby-Bonghy-B�!
Mr. Yonghy-Bonghy-B�!"


VIII.

Down the slippery slopes of Myrtle,
Where the early pumpkins blow,
To the calm and silent sea
Fled the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
There, beyond the Bay of Gurtle,
Lay a large and lively Turtle.
"You're the Cove," he said, "for me;
On your back beyond the sea,
Turtle, you shall carry me!"
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
Said the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.




IX.

Through the silent-roaring ocean
Did the Turtle swiftly go;
Holding fast upon his shell
Rode the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
With a sad primaeval motion
Towards the sunset isles of Boshen
Still the Turtle bore him well.
Holding fast upon his shell,
"Lady Jingly Jones, farewell!"
Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
Sang the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.


X.

From the Coast of Coromandel
Did that Lady never go;
On that heap of stones she mourns
For the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
On that Coast of Coromandel,
In his jug without a handle
Still she weeps, and daily moans;
On that little heap of stones
To her Dorking Hens she moans,
For the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�,
For the Yonghy-Bonghy-B�.
