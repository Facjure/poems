title: To One On A Journey
---

Why did you go away without one word,
Wave of the hand, or token of good-bye,
Nor leave some message for me with flower or bird,
Some sign to find you by;

Some stray of blossom on the winter road,
To know your feet had gone that very way,
Told me the star that points to your abode,
And tossed me one faint ray

To climb from out the night where now I dwell - 
Or, seemed it best for you to go alone
To heaven, as alone I go to hell
Upon the four winds blown.
