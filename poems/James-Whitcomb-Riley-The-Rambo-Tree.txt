 When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard! - 
 The bird sings low as the bumble-bee - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard! - 
 The poor shote-pig he says, says he:
 "When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree
 There's enough for you and enough for me." - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

 For just two truant lads like we,
 When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree
 There's enough for you and enough for me - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

 When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard! - 
 The mole digs out to peep and see - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard! - 
 The dusk sags down, and the moon swings free,
 There's a far, lorn call, "Pig-gee! 'Pig-gee!"
 And two boys - glad enough for three. - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.

 For just two truant lads like we,
 When Autumn shakes the rambo-tree
 There's enough for you and enough for me - 
It's a long, sweet way across the orchard.
