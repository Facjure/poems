The day is at its golden height,
 No shadow falls on sea or land;
And yet to thee I say Good night,
 As we stand here hand clasped in hand,
Good night -Good night.

The laughing waves are summer blue,
 The bees hum in the sun's warm light;
But frosts of winter chill me through,
 I shiver as I say Good night.
Good night -Good night.

How often at the close of day
 With smiling lips we've said those words:
And listened as we turned away
 To hear them echoed by the birds,
Good night -Good night.

We did not dream then of this hour,
 This sad, sad hour for you and me;
We did not dream there was a power
 Could force us for eternity
To say Good night.

Good night -nay, turn your eyes away;
 I cannot bear their tender light.
Now evermore to golden day,
 To golden hope, a last Good night,
Good night -Good night.
