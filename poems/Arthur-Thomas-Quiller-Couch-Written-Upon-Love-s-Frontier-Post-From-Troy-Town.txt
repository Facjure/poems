 Toiling love, loose your pack,
 All your sighs and tears unbind:
 Care's a ware will break a back,
 Will not bend a maiden's mind.

 In this State a man shall need
 Neither priest nor law giver:
 Those same lips that are his creed
 Shall confess their worshipper.

 All the laws he must obey,
 Now in force and now repeal'd,
 Shift in eyes that shift as they,
 Till alike with kisses seal'd.
