These verses were written soon after the Old Age Pensions Bill came into operation.


I'd walk frae here to Skipton,
 Ten mile o' clarty(1) lanes,
If I might see him face to face
 An' thank him for his pains.
He's ta'en me out o' t' Bastile,(2)
 He's gi'en me life that's free:
Five shill'n a week for fuglin'(3) Death
Is what Lord George gives me.

He gives me leet an' firin',
 An' flour to bak i' t' yoon.(4)
I've tea to mesh for ivery meal
 An' sup all t' afternoon.
I've nowt to do but thank him,
 An' mak' a cross wi' t' pen;
Five shillin' a week for nobbut that!
 Gow! he's the jewel o' men.

I niver mell on pol'tics,
 But I do love a lord;
He spends his savin's like a king,
 Wheer other fowks 'll hoard.
I know a vast o' widdies
 That's seen their seventieth year;
Lord George, he addles brass for all,
 Though lots on 't goes for beer.

If my owd man were livin',
 He'd say as I spak true;
He couldn't thole them yallow Rads,
 But awlus voted blue.
An' parson's wife, shoo telled me
 That we'll sooin go to t' poll;
I hope shoo's reight; I'll vote for George,
 Wi' all my heart an' soul.


I don't know wheer he springs frae,
 Happen it's down Leeds way;
But ivery neet an' mornin'
 For his lang life I pray.
He's ta'en me out o' t' Bastile,
 He's gi'en me life that's free:
Five shill'n a week for fuglin' Death
 Is what Lord George gives me.
