If flies be dragons
and they may you know.
In large desiccated brambles
where wasps go
involuntary blue-green coelacanths
these Devil's Darning Needles
wedge in Flying Circuses
frame pale diaphanous wet green sky
as shooting columns
twig and Rock Face.

There, fire-bush
entrance scrapes paler wax
green fronds then
Blue Holes into canopies
thru the stars.
