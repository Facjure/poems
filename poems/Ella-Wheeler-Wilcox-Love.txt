Dreaming of love, the ardent mind of youth
 Conceives it one with passion's brief delights,
With keen desire and rapture.But, in truth,
 These are but milestones to sublime heights
After the highways, swept by strong emotions,
 Where wild winds blow and blazing sun rays beat,
After the billows of tempestuous oceans,
 Fair mountain summits wait the lover's feet.

The path is narrow, but the view is wide,
 And beauteous the outlook towards the west
Happy are they who walk there side by side,
 Leaving below the valleys of unrest,
And on the radiant altitudes above
Know the serene intensity of love.
