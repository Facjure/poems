Now the light o� the west is a-turn�d to gloom,
An� the men be at hwome vrom ground;
An� the bells be a-zend�n all down the Coombe
From tower, their mwoansome sound.
An� the wind is still,
An� the house-dogs do bark,
An� the rooks be a-vled to the elems high an� dark,
An� the water do roar at mill.

An� the flicker�n light drough the window-pe�ne
Vrom the candle�s dull fle�me do shoot,
An� young Jemmy the smith is a-gone down le�ne,
A-pla��n his shrill-vaiced flute.
An� the miller�s man,
Do zit down at his ease
On the seat that is under the cluster o� trees,
Wi� his pipe an� his cider can.
