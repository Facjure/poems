 Child, do you love the flower
Ashine with colour and dew
 Lighting its transient hour?
 So I love you.

 The lambs in the mead are at play,
'Neath a hurdle the shepherd's asleep;
 From height to height of the day
 The sunbeams sweep.

 Evening will come. And alone
The dreamer the dark will beguile;
 All the world will be gone
 For a dream's brief while.

 Then I shall be old; and away:
And you, with sad joy in your eyes,
 Will brood over children at play
 With as loveful surmise.
