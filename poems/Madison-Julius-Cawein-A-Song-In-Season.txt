I.

When in the wind the vane turns round,
 And round, and round;
And in his kennel whines the hound;
When all the gable eaves are bound
With icicles of ragged gray,
 A glinting gray;
There is little to do, and much to say,
And you hug your fire and pass the day
 With a thought of the springtime, dearie.


II.

When late at night the owlet hoots,
 And hoots, and hoots;
And wild winds make of keyholes flutes;
When to the door the goodman's boots
Stamp through the snow the light stains red,
 The fire-light's red;
There is nothing to do, and all is said,
And you quaff your cider and go to bed
 With a dream of the summer, dearie.


III.

When, nearing dawn, the black cock crows,
 And crows, and crows;
And from the barn the milch-cow lows;
And the milkmaid's cheeks have each a rose,
And the still skies show a star or two,
 Or one or two;
There is little to say, and much to do,
And the heartier done the happier you,
 With a song of the winter, dearie.
