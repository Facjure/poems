title: The Crew Of The Nancy Lee.
---

Polly's the mate of the Nancy Lee,
And Tom is the skipper bold,
They sail together
In rough wind and weather,
And they are the crew, all told.

In their taut and trim little boat they ride
Away o'er the bright blue sea,
With hands ever ready,
And hearts ever steady,
Whatever the dangers may be.
And a smarter crew will never be found,
Though you may search the whole world round.
