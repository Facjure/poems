title: The Beanfield

 A beanfield full in blossom smells as sweet
 As Araby, or groves of orange flowers;
 Black-eyed and white, and feathered to one's feet,
 How sweet they smell in morning's dewy hours!
 When seething night is left upon the flowers,
 And when morn's sun shines brightly o'er the field,
 The bean bloom glitters in the gems of showers,
 And sweet the fragrance which the union yields
 To battered footpaths crossing o'er the fields.
