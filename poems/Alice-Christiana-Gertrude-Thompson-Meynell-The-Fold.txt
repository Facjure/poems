 Behold,
The time is now! Bring back, bring back
Thy flocks of fancies, wild of whim.
Oh lead them from the mountain-track -
 Thy frolic thoughts untold.
Oh bring them in - the fields grow dim -
 And let me be the fold.

 Behold,
The time is now! Call in, O call
Thy posturing kisses gone astray
For scattered sweets. Gather them all
 To shelter from the cold.
Throng them together, close and gay,
 And let me be the fold!
