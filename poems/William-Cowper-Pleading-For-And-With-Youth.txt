title: Pleading For And With Youth.
---

Sin has undone our wretched race,
But Jesus has restored,
And brought the sinner face to face
With his forgiving Lord.


This we repeat, from year to year,
And press upon our youth;
Lord, give them an attentive ear,
Lord, save them by thy truth.


Blessings upon the rising race!
Make this a happy hour,
According to thy richest grace,
And thine almighty power.


We feel for your unhappy state
(May you regard it too),
And would awhile ourselves forge
To pour out prayer for you.


We see, though you perceive it not,
The approaching awful doom;
O tremble at the solemn thought,
And flee the wrath to come!


Dear Saviour, let this new-born year
Spread an alarm abroad;
And cry in every careless ear,
�Prepare to meet thy God!�
