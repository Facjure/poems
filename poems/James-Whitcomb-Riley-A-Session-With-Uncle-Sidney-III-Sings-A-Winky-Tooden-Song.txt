title: A Session With Uncle Sidney - III - Sings A "Winky-Tooden" Song
---

 O here's a little rhyme for the Spring- or Summer-time - 
An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho! - 
 Just a little bit o' tune you can twitter, May or June,
An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
 It's a song that soars and sings,
 As the birds that twang their wings
 Or the katydids and things
Thus and so, don't you know,
An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!

 It's a song just broken loose, with no reason or excuse - 
An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
 You can sing along with it - or it matters not a bit - 
An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
 It's a lovely little thing
 That 'most any one could sing
 With a ringle-dingle-ding,
Soft and low, don't you know,
An a-ho-winky-tooden-an-a-ho!
