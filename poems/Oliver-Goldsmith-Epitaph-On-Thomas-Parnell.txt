title: Epitaph On Thomas Parnell
---

This tomb, inscrib'd to gentle Parnell's name,
May speak our gratitude, but not his fame.
What heart but feels his sweetly-moral lay,
That leads to truth through pleasure's flowery way!
Celestial themes confess'd his tuneful aid;
And Heaven, that lent him genius, was repaid.
Needless to him the tribute we bestow 
The transitory breath of fame below:
More lasting rapture from his works shall rise,
While Converts thank their poet in the skies.
