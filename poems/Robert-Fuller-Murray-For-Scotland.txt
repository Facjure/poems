Beyond the Cheviots and the Tweed,
 Beyond the Firth of Forth,
My memory returns at speed
 To Scotland and the North.

For still I keep, and ever shall,
 A warm place in my heart for Scotland,
Scotland, Scotland,
 A warm place in my heart for Scotland.

Oh, cruel off St. Andrew's Bay
 The winds are wont to blow!
They either rest or gently play,
 When there in dreams I go.

And there I wander, young again,
 With limbs that do not tire,
Along the coast to Kittock's Den,
 With whinbloom all afire.

I climb the Spindle Rock, and lie
 And take my doubtful ease,
Between the ocean and the sky,
 Derided by the breeze.

Where coloured mushrooms thickly grow,
 Like flowers of brittle stalk,
To haunted Magus Muir I go,
 By Lady Catherine's Walk.

In dreams the year I linger through,
 In that familiar town,
Where all the youth I ever knew,
 Burned up and flickered down.

There's not a rock that fronts the sea,
 There's not an inland grove,
But has a tale to tell to me
 Of friendship or of love.

And so I keep, and ever shall,
 The best place in my heart for Scotland,
Scotland, Scotland,
 The best place in my heart for Scotland!
