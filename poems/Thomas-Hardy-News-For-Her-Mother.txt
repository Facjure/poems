I

 One mile more is
 Where your door is
 Mother mine! -
 Harvest's coming,
 Mills are strumming,
 Apples fine,
And the cider made to-year will be as wine.

II

 Yet, not viewing
 What's a-doing
 Here around
 Is it thrills me,
 And so fills me
 That I bound
Like a ball or leaf or lamb along the ground.

III

 Tremble not now
 At your lot now,
 Silly soul!
 Hosts have sped them
 Quick to wed them,
 Great and small,
Since the first two sighing half-hearts made a whole.

IV

 Yet I wonder,
 Will it sunder
 Her from me?
 Will she guess that
 I said "Yes," - that
 His I'd be,
Ere I thought she might not see him as I see!

V

 Old brown gable,
 Granary, stable,
 Here you are!
 O my mother,
 Can another
 Ever bar
Mine from thy heart, make thy nearness seem afar?
