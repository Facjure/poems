 Green moss will creep
 Along the shady graves where we shall sleep.

 Each year will bring
 Another brood of birds to nest and sing.

 At dawn will go
 New ploughmen to the fields we used to know.

 Night will call home
 The hunter from the hills we loved to roam.

 She will not ask,
 The milkmaid, singing softly at her task,

 Nor will she care
 To know if I were brave or you were fair.

 No one will think
 What chalice life had offered us to drink,

 When from our clay
 The sun comes back to kiss the snow away.
