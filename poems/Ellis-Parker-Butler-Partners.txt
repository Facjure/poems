Love took chambers on our street
Opposite to mine;
On his door he tacked a neat,
Clearly lettered sign.

Straightway grew his custom great,
For his sign read so:
�Hearts united while you wait.
Step in. Love and Co.�

Much I wondered who was �Co.�
In Love�s partnership;
Thought across the street I�d go,
Learn from Love�s own lip.

So I went; and since that day
Life is hard for me.
I was buncoed! (By the way,
�Co.� is Jealousy.)
