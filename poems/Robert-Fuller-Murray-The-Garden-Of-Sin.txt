title: The Garden Of Sin
---

I know the garden-close of sin,
 The cloying fruits, the noxious flowers,
 I long have roamed the walks and bowers,
Desiring what no man shall win:

A secret place to shelter in,
 When soon or late the angry powers
 Come down to seek the wretch who cowers,
Expecting judgment to begin.

The pleasure long has passed away
 From flowers and fruit, each hour I dread
My doom will find me where I lie.
I dare not go, I dare not stay.
 Without the walks, my hope is dead,
Within them, I myself must die.
