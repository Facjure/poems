 I.

I see them still, when poring o'er
Old volumes of romantic lore,
Ride forth to hawk in days of yore,
 By woods and promontories;
Knights in gold lace, plumes and gems,
Maidens crowned with anadems, - 
Whose falcons on round wrists of milk
Sit in jesses green of silk, - 
 From bannered Miraflores.


 II.

The laughing earth is young with dew;
The deeps above are violet blue;
And in the East a cloud or two
 Empearled with airy glories:
And with laughter, jest and singing,
Silver bells of falcons ringing,
Hawkers, rosy with the dawn,
Gayly ride o'er hill and lawn
 From courtly Miraflores.


 III.

The torrents silver down the crags;
Down dim-green vistas browse the stags;
And from wet beds of reeds and flags
 The frightened lapwing hurries;
And the brawny wild-boar peereth
At the cavalcade that neareth;
Oft his shaggy-throated grunt
Brings the king and court to hunt
 At royal Miraflores.


 IV.

The May itself in soft sea-green
Is Oriana, Spring's high queen,
And Amadis beside her seen
 Some prince of Fairy stones:
Where her castle's ivied towers
Drowse above her budded bowers,
Flaps the heron thro' the sky,
And the wild swan gives a cry
 By woody Miraflores.
