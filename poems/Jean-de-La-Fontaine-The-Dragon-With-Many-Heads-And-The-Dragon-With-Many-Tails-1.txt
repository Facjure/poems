title: The Dragon With Many Heads, And The Dragon With Many Tails.[1]
---

 An envoy of the Porte Sublime,
 As history says, once on a time,
 Before th' imperial German court[2]
 Did rather boastfully report,
 The troops commanded by his master's firman,
 As being a stronger army than the German:
 To which replied a Dutch attendant,
 'Our prince has more than one dependant
 Who keeps an army at his own expense.'
 The Turk, a man of sense,
 Rejoin'd, 'I am aware
 What power your emperor's servants share.
 It brings to mind a tale both strange and true,
 A thing which once, myself, I chanced to view.
 I saw come darting through a hedge,
 Which fortified a rocky ledge,
 A hydra's hundred heads; and in a trice
 My blood was turning into ice.
 But less the harm than terror, - 
 The body came no nearer;
 Nor could, unless it had been sunder'd,
 To parts at least a hundred.
 While musing deeply on this sight,
 Another dragon came to light,
 Whose single head avails
 To lead a hundred tails:
 And, seized with juster fright,
 I saw him pass the hedge, - 
 Head, body, tails, - a wedge
 Of living and resistless powers. - 
 The other was your emperor's force; this ours.'
