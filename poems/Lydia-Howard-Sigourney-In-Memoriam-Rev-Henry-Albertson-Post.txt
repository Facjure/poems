[1]Read me rejoicing Psalms,
Oh dearest one, and best!
I go from war to peace,
From pain to glorious rest,

Where the bright life-tree sheds
Around its precious balms,
So, while I linger here
Read me rejoicing psalms.

And when my place I take
Amid the ransom'd throng
Who through a Saviour's love
Uplift the immortal song,

Repress the tear of grief
That washes faith away,
And brave in zeal and love
Await our meeting-day.

Yes, let thy course below
Through all its fleeting days
In its angelic ministries
Be as a psalm of praise.
