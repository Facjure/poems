title: Song Is Not Dead
---

Song is not dead, although to-day
 Men tell us everything is said.
There yet is something left to say,
 Song is not dead.

While still the evening sky is red,
 While still the morning gold and grey,
While still the autumn leaves are shed,

While still the heart of youth is gay,
 And honour crowns the hoary head,
While men and women love and pray
 Song is not dead.
