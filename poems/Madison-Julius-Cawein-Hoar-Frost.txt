 The frail eidolons of all blossoms Spring,
 Year after year, about the forest tossed,
 The magic touch of the enchanter, Frost,
 Back from the Heaven of the Flow'rs doth bring;
 Each branch and bush in silence visiting
 With phantom beauty of its blooms long lost:
 Each dead weed bends, white-haunted of its ghost,
 Each dead flower stands ghostly with blossoming.
 This is the wonder-legend Nature tells
 To the gray moon and mist a winter's night;
 The fairy-tale, which her weird fancy 'spells
 With all the glamour of her soul's delight:
 Before the summoning sorcery of her eyes
 Making her spirit's dream materialize.
