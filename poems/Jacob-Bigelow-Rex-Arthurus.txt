	 When King Arthur ruled the land,
	He ruled it like a king:
	 He bought four pecks of barley-meal
	To make a brave pudding.

	 A pudding brave the king did make
	And stuffed it well with plums;
	 Great lumps of suet he put into it,
	As big as both his thumbs.

	 The king and queen partook thereof,
	And all the court beside;
	 And what they did not eat that night,
	The queen next morning fried.

	Angli� rex imperio potitus,
	Hordei nactus modium farin�,
	Ordinat c�n� proper� institut�
	Sternere mensam.

	Mira farrago exoritur culin�,
	Turgidis uvis maculata passis
	Intus et frustis adipis referta
	Pollicis instar.

	Rex et affines epulantur omnes
	Principes magni domin�que lect�:
	Alma regina exoriente luce
	Fragmina frixit.
