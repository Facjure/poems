title: Paths That Wind . . .

Paths that wind
O'er the hills and by the streams
I must leave behind - 
Dawns and dews and dreams.
Trails that go
Through the woods and down the slopes
To the vale below;
Done with fears and hopes,
I must wander on
Till the purple twilight ends,
Where the sun has gone - 
Faces, flowers and friends.
