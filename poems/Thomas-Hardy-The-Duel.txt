 "I am here to time, you see;
The glade is well-screened - eh? - against alarm;
 Fit place to vindicate by my arm
 The honour of my spotless wife,
 Who scorns your libel upon her life
 In boasting intimacy!

 "'All hush-offerings you'll spurn,
My husband. Two must come; one only go,'
 She said. 'That he'll be you I know;
 To faith like ours Heaven will be just,
 And I shall abide in fullest trust
 Your speedy glad return.'"

 "Good. Here am also I;
And we'll proceed without more waste of words
 To warm your cockpit. Of the swords
 Take you your choice. I shall thereby
 Feel that on me no blame can lie,
 Whatever Fate accords."

 So stripped they there, and fought,
And the swords clicked and scraped, and the onsets sped;
 Till the husband fell; and his shirt was red
 With streams from his heart's hot cistern. Nought
 Could save him now; and the other, wrought
 Maybe to pity, said:

 "Why did you urge on this?
Your wife assured you; and 't had better been
 That you had let things pass, serene
 In confidence of long-tried bliss,
 Holding there could be nought amiss
 In what my words might mean."

 Then, seeing nor ruth nor rage
Could move his foeman more - now Death's deaf thrall -
 He wiped his steel, and, with a call
 Like turtledove to dove, swift broke
 Into the copse, where under an oak
 His horse cropt, held by a page.

 "All's over, Sweet," he cried
To the wife, thus guised; for the young page was she.
 "'Tis as we hoped and said 't would be.
 He never guessed . . . We mount and ride
 To where our love can reign uneyed.
 He's clay, and we are free."
