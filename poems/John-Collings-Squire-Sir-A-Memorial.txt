 (F.T.)


 The cord broke, and the tent
 Slipped, and the silken roof
 Lay prone beneath the viewless hoof
 Of the deliberate firmament.
 Yet cared we not; how should we care?
 Knowing that labourless now he breathes
 A golden paradisal air
 Where with more certain craft he wreathes
 Bright braids of words more wise and fair
 Than ever his earthly fabrics were,
 That his unwavering eyes made fresh,
 Purged and regarbed in fadeless flesh,
 What he then darkly guessed behold,
 And watch with an abiding joy
 The eternal mysteries unfold
 Which do his now transfigured songs evermore employ.

 Brother, yet great thy power;
 Thou stood'st as on a tower
 Small 'neath the stars yet high above the fields;
 In thy alembic song
 Imagination strong
 Distilled what essences the quest to mortals yields.
 This thy reward well-won,
 For every morning's sun
 Found thy heart's firm allegiance still unshaken;
 No temporal ache or smart
 Drave Beauty from thy heart,
 And by thy mighty mistress never wast forsaken.

 Yes; for though stringent was the test,
 When that thy trial was bitterest,
 Steadfast thou did'st remain; unshod
 The harrows of Pain thy feet once trod,
 Humiliate as thy sad song tells
 Before the vault's white sentinels.
 Friendless and faint thou sojourned'st there,
 A bowed, brave, timid wanderer,
 A lonely nomad of the spirit,
 Who did a triple curse inherit,
 Hunger, regret and memory.
 Yet never did they vanquish thee;
 When nighest broken, most alone,
 Thy unassuag�d thoughts could clamber
 To beauty on her ageless throne;
 Thou wert as one in torture chamber
 Who sees the blue through an open casement
 And hammers his soul to endure the time
 Of his corporeal abasement;
 Nor writhed'st at thine or others' fault,
 But with grim tenderness did salt
 Thy cicatrices with a rhyme.
 Not the most sable flame of gloom
 Could penetrate thy inmost room;
 But through the walls thy spirit sucked
 Into that cloistral hermitage
 Stray lovely things, moonbeams and snows
 The far sky shed into thy cage,
 And, from the very gutter plucked,
 A lost and mired campestral rose.

 Ended that purgatorial period,
 Filled was thy wallet and thy feet were shod,
 The leaden weights were moved, the rack withdrawn,
 Thou didst traverse the dewy fields of dawn,
 Watch sunsets blazoning over upland turf,
 Pull poppies from the frontiers of the surf,
 Dwelled'st with love and human eyes
 Vigilant, calm and wise.
 But still as when thy bark did ride
 Derelict on the city's tide,
 As then for penury now for pride
 Thy bodily senses were denied;
 Though they cried out and would not sleep,
 Ascetic thou didst armour them
 Lest acid pleasure should eat thine art's pure gem.
 Hourly the tempter's ambuscades
 But thou didst guard the gates and keep
 Thy senses' hungry colonnades
 Accessible but to Beauty's ministers,
 Unlit by any ruby flame but hers.
 Immuring so thy spirit eager
 Within a body frail and meagre,
 Far from the meads of earthly milk and honey,
 Yet franchised of more wondrous territories,
 Like those poor Bedouin of Arabia the Stony
 Who roam spare-fed and hollow-eyed but free
 By day to wander and by night to camp
 In vast serenity,
 Compassed by God's great silent glories
 The sun's gold splendour and the moon's white lamp,
 Folded and safe from harm
 Beneath the mighty sky's protecting arm.

 Ha! but the Titan's ardour
 Wherewith thou scour'dst the vast,
 To spoil the starry larder
 Of fruits of heavenly taste!
 Urania's fiercest servant,
 With thirst as furnace fervent
 And serene burning brow,
 Worthy of thy great lineage, thou
 Drankest without a shudder
 In proud humility
 Milk from that vast prim�val udder
 That swells for such as thee,
 Milk from the fountains of the Universe
 That cowards deem infected with a curse,
 That flushes him who drinks
 Nor shrinks
 The exalted anguish of diurnal draughts
 To a clear vision, more intolerable
 In its blissful pain, than love's most ardent shafts,
 Of the seats where she doth dwell,
 She, whom thou didst confess
 Enticed
 Thee hot to her throne to press
 For the greater glory of Christ
 To uplift the curtains of her closed eyes.

 Not all was for thy learning
 Nor any mortal's else;
 Only for thy discerning
 Sporadic syllables
 Of those supernal glances
 Coffer of which her marble countenance is,
 Yet vain was not the adventure,
 Reluctant though the prize,
 Thou gainedst a debenture
 On the fringe of Beauty's eyes;
 Such fragmentary trophy
 As some cross-tunic'd knight
 From Saladin or Sophy
 May have won in sword's despite,
 Not the dear polar shrines
 Held captive by the Paynim
 But still as fruit of wars
 Some stone from Sion's lines,
 Some relic that might sain him
 Of life's uncounted scars.

 Self-dedicated anchorite,
 Never disdainful of the dust,
 But conscious of the overcoming night
 That must engulph the blooms and berries of lust,
 And unforgetful of the enveloping day beyond;
 Though a sweet show was spread for thy delight
 Resolved not to be so fond
 As, in ephemeral gauds caparisoned,
 To station feet upon a world of vapour
 Soft as a dream and fleeting as a taper;
 Thou thoughtest nevertheless that thou shouldst occupy
 Thyself, as it seemed to thee, most worthily
 Until the rapid hour when thou shouldst die;
 So, in a world of seemings,
 Of shadows and of dreamings,
 Busied thyself to fashion and record
 Unto the greater glory of thy Lord,
 For thy proud lady Beauty His
 Most excellent and humble handmaid is.
 Says one thy service was too ceremonial,
 Thy vestments irised overmuch, thy ritual
 Too elaborate and thy rubric too obscure,
 Therefore thy gift of chant and orison
 Beneath the perfect service men have done.
 O but thy notes were pure,
 And in a day like this we now endure
 No fault it was in thee to set thy camp
 Remote, aloof, aloof,
 In a far fastness proof
 'Gainst the mephitic odours of the swamp.
 Which being so, no gain
 'Twere to explain
 An exquisiteness too meticulous;
 Let us but say it pleased thee thus,
 Dowered with imagination heavy-fruited,
 To raise a column garlanded and fluted
 For Him thy heavenly abacus.
 This was thine offering thou didst make
 In founded hope that He
 The craftsman's best would take
 Well knowing its unobscure sincerity.

 The cord broke and the tent
 Slipped and the silken roof
 Lay prone beneath the viewless hoof
 Of the deliberate firmament.
 We still in this terrene abode
 Forlorn must tread the difficult road,
 And all meek thanks and all belief
 Hardly suffice to rampart grief.
 For gone is Beauty's votary apostolic
 And are her temples now delivered over
 To blindworms and libidinous goats that frolic
 In places hallowed by that celestial lover.
 Save only two or three
 With undivided minds like thee,
 None now remains that girds
 The peregrinal loin,
 None reverent of Beauty's holy tongue,
 But counterfeiters of her imaged coin,
 Iconoclasts, breakers of carven words,
 Seekers of worthless treasure in the dung,
 Mock mages and cacophonous charlatans,
 And pismire artisans
 Labouring to make
 Such mirrored replicas of Nature's face
 As might the surface of a stagnant lake.

 Yet we should anger not,
 Nor let that be forgot,
 The testament of stateliest worth
 He left us when he fled the earth.
 The mausoleum made of rhyme,
 Fair in its unfrequented field,
 Which shall invulnerably shield
 His memory to the end of Time;
 The house with curtain-flaming halls
 And roof of gold and jewelled walls
 For which the fisher sank his net
 Into the deepest pools of speech,
 Scooping rich conchs and ribbons wet
 That a less venturous could not reach,
 The hunter tracked the metaphor
 On many a foamy silver coast
 A hundred leagues beyond the most
 Fabulous Tellurian shore.

 Magnificent he was and mild,
 Glad to be still and glad to speak,
 Daring yet delicate as a child,
 Faithful, compassionate and holy,
 And, being human, strong and weak,
 And full of hope and melancholy.
 No more than we, able to shed
 Man's nature he inherited,
 Neither sin's garrison to kill,
 Yet at the last with constancy so great
 As the world's vanities to abnegate,
 Sternly to will the sacrifice of will
 Upon the altars of the Uncreate,
 So that he lived before he died
 As one who hourly to himself denied
 All joys save those that cannot pall,
 Who having nothing yet had all.
