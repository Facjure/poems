title: I Went down into the Desert
---

 I went down into the desert
 To meet Elijah - 
 Arisen from the dead.
 I thought to find him in an echoing cave;
 For so my dream had said.

 I went down into the desert
 To meet John the Baptist.
 I walked with feet that bled,
 Seeking that prophet lean and brown and bold.
 I spied foul fiends instead.

 I went down into the desert
 To meet my God.
 By him be comforted.
 I went down into the desert
 To meet my God.
 And I met the devil in red.

 I went down into the desert
 To meet my God.
 O, Lord my God, awaken from the dead!
 I see you there, your thorn-crown on the ground,
 I see you there, half-buried in the sand.
 I see you there, your white bones glistening, bare,
 The carrion-birds a-wheeling round your head.
