Ask if I love thee?Oh, smiles cannot tell
Plainer what tears are now showing too well.
Had I not loved thee, my sky had been clear:
Had I not loved thee, I had not been here,
 Weeping by thee.

Ask if I love thee?How else could I borrow
Pride from man's slander, and strength from my sorrow?
Laugh when they sneer at the fanatic's bride,
Knowing no bliss, save to toil and abide
 Weeping by thee.

Andernach on the Rhine,
August 1851.
