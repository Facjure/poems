(Moon Poems for the Children/Fairy-tales for the Children)

 Hungry for music with a desperate hunger
 I prowled abroad, I threaded through the town;
 The evening crowd was clamoring and drinking,
 Vulgar and pitiful - my heart bowed down - 
 Till I remembered duller hours made noble
 By strangers clad in some surprising grace.
 Wait, wait, my soul, your music comes ere midnight
 Appearing in some unexpected place
 With quivering lips, and gleaming, moonlit face.
