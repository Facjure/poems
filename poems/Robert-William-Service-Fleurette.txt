 (The Wounded Canadian Speaks)



 My leg? It's off at the knee.
 Do I miss it? Well, some. You see
 I've had it since I was born;
 And lately a devilish corn.
 (I rather chuckle with glee
 To think how I've fooled that corn.)

 But I'll hobble around all right.
 It isn't that, it's my face.
 Oh I know I'm a hideous sight,
 Hardly a thing in place;
 Sort of gargoyle, you'd say.
 Nurse won't give me a glass,
 But I see the folks as they pass
 Shudder and turn away;
 Turn away in distress . . .
 Mirror enough, I guess.

 I'm gay! You bet I am gay;
 But I wasn't a while ago.
 If you'd seen me even to-day,
 The darndest picture of woe,
 With this Caliban mug of mine,
 So ravaged and raw and red,
 Turned to the wall - in fine,
 Wishing that I was dead. . . .
 What has happened since then,
 Since I lay with my face to the wall,
 The most despairing of men?
 Listen! I'll tell you all.

 That 'poilu' across the way,
 With the shrapnel wound in his head,
 Has a sister: she came to-day
 To sit awhile by his bed.
 All morning I heard him fret:
 "Oh, when will she come, Fleurette?"

 Then sudden, a joyous cry;
 The tripping of little feet;
 The softest, tenderest sigh;
 A voice so fresh and sweet;
 Clear as a silver bell,
 Fresh as the morning dews:
 "C'est toi, c'est toi, Marcel!
 Mon frï¿½re, comme je suis heureuse!"

 So over the blanket's rim
 I raised my terrible face,
 And I saw - how I envied him!
 A girl of such delicate grace;
 Sixteen, all laughter and love;
 As gay as a linnet, and yet
 As tenderly sweet as a dove;
 Half woman, half child - Fleurette.

 Then I turned to the wall again.
 (I was awfully blue, you see),
 And I thought with a bitter pain:
 "Such visions are not for me."
 So there like a log I lay,
 All hidden, I thought, from view,
 When sudden I heard her say:
 "Ah! Who is that 'malheureux'?"
 Then briefly I heard him tell
 (However he came to know)
 How I'd smothered a bomb that fell
 Into the trench, and so
 None of my men were hit,
 Though it busted me up a bit.

 Well, I didn't quiver an eye,
 And he chattered and there she sat;
 And I fancied I heard her sigh - 
 But I wouldn't just swear to that.
 And maybe she wasn't so bright,
 Though she talked in a merry strain,
 And I closed my eyes ever so tight,
 Yet I saw her ever so plain:
 Her dear little tilted nose,
 Her delicate, dimpled chin,
 Her mouth like a budding rose,
 And the glistening pearls within;
 Her eyes like the violet:
 Such a rare little queen - Fleurette.

 And at last when she rose to go,
 The light was a little dim,
 And I ventured to peep, and so
 I saw her, graceful and slim,
 And she kissed him and kissed him, and oh
 How I envied and envied him!

 So when she was gone I said
 In rather a dreary voice
 To him of the opposite bed:
 "Ah, friend, how you must rejoice!
 But me, I'm a thing of dread.
 For me nevermore the bliss,
 The thrill of a woman's kiss."

 Then I stopped, for lo! she was there,
 And a great light shone in her eyes.
 And me! I could only stare,
 I was taken so by surprise,
 When gently she bent her head:
 "May I kiss you, Sergeant?" she said.

 Then she kissed my burning lips
 With her mouth like a scented flower,
 And I thrilled to the finger-tips,
 And I hadn't even the power
 To say: "God bless you, dear!"
 And I felt such a precious tear
 Fall on my withered cheek,
 And darn it! I couldn't speak.

 And so she went sadly away,
 And I knew that my eyes were wet.
 Ah, not to my dying day
 Will I forget, forget!
 Can you wonder now I am gay?
 God bless her, that little Fleurette!
