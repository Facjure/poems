 I dreamt (no "dream" awake-a dream indeed)
 A wrathful man was talking in the park:
 "Where are the Higher Powers, who know our need
And leave us in the dark?

 "There are no Higher Powers; there is no heart
 In God, no love"-his oratory here,
 Taking the paupers� and the cripples� part,
Was broken by a tear.

 And then it seemed that One who did create
 Compassion, who alone invented pity,
 Walked, as though called, in at that north-east gate,
Out from the muttering city;

 Threaded the little crowd, trod the brown grass,
 Bent o�er the speaker close, saw the tear rise,
 And saw Himself, as one looks in a glass,
In those impassioned eyes.
