I.

GR-R-R there go, my heart�s abhorrence!
Water your damned flower-pots, do!
If hate killed men, Brother Lawrence,
God�s blood, would not mine kill you!
What? your myrtle-bush wants trimming?
Oh, that rose has prior claims
Needs its leaden vase filled brimming?
Hell dry you up with its flames!

II.

At the meal we sit together:
Salve tibi! I must hear
Wise talk of the kind of weather,
Sort of season, time of year:
Not a plenteous cork-crop: scarcely
Dare we hope oak-galls, I doubt:
What�s the Latin name for �parsley�?
What�s the Greek name for Swine�s Snout?

III.

Whew! We�ll have our platter burnished,
Laid with care on our own shelf!
With a fire-new spoon we�re furnished,
And a goblet for ourself,
Rinsed like something sacrificial
Ere �tis fit to touch our chaps
Marked with L. for our initial!
(He-he! There his lily snaps!)

IV.

Saint, forsooth! While brown Dolores
Squats outside the Convent bank
With Sanchicha, telling stories,
Steeping tresses in the tank,
Blue-black, lustrous, thick like horsehairs,
Can�t I see his dead eye glow,
Bright as �twere a Barbary corsair�s?
(That is, if he�d let it show!)

V.

When he finishes refection,
Knife and fork he never lays
Cross-wise, to my recollection,
As do I, in Jesu�s praise.
I the Trinity illustrate,
Drinking watered orange-pulp
In three sips the Arian frustrate;
fWhile he drains his at one gulp.

VI.

Oh, those melons? If he�s able
We�re to have a feast! so nice!
One goes to the Abbot�s table,
All of us get each a slice.
How go on your flowers? None double
Not one fruit-sort can you spy?
Strange! And I, too, at such trouble,
Keep them close-nipped on the sly!

VII.

There�s a great text in Galatians,
Once you trip on it, entails
Twenty-nine distinct damnations,
One sure, if another fails:
If I trip him just a-dying,
Sure of heaven as sure can be,
Spin him round and send him flying
Off to Hell, a Manichee?

VIII.

Or, my scrofulous French novel
On grey paper with blunt type!
Simply glance at it, you grovel
Hand and foot in Belial�s gripe:
If I double down its pages
At the woeful sixteenth print,
When he gathers his greengages,
Ope a sieve and slip it in�t?

IX.

Or, there�s Satan! one might venture
Pledge one�s soul to him, yet leave
Such a flaw in the indenture
As he�d miss till, past retrieve,
Blasted lay that rose-acacia
We�re so proud of! Hy, Zy, Hine . . .
�St, there�s Vespers! Plena grati�
Ave, Virgo! Gr-r-r you swine!
