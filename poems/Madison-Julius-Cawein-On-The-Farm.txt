I.

He sang a song as he sowed the field,
 Sowed the field at break of day:
"When the pursed-up leaves are as lips that yield
Balm and balsam, and Spring, - concealed
In the odorous green, - is so revealed,
 Halloo and oh!
Hallo for the woods and the far away!"


II.

He trilled a song as he mowed the mead,
 Mowed the mead as noon begun:
"When the hills are gold with the ripened seed,
As the sunset stairs that loom and lead
To the sky where Summer knows naught of need,
 Halloo and oh!
Hallo for the hills and the harvest sun!"


III.

He hummed a song as he swung the flail,
 Swung the flail in the afternoon:
"When the idle fields are a wrecker's tale,
That the Autumn tells to the twilight pale,
As the Year turns seaward a crimson sail,
 Halloo and oh!
Hallo for the fields and the hunter's-moon!"


IV.

He whistled a song as he shouldered his axe,
 Shouldered his axe in the evening storm:
"When the snow of the road shows the rabbit's tracks,
And the wind is a whip that the Winter cracks,
With a herdsman's cry, o'er the clouds' black backs,
 Halloo and oh!
Hallo for home and a hearth to warm!"
