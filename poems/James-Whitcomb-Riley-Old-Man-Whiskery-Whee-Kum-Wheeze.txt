 Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze
 Lives 'way up in the leaves o' trees.
 An' wunst I slipped up-stairs to play
 In Aunty's room, while she 'uz away;
 An' I clumbed up in her cushion-chair
 An' ist peeked out o' the winder there;
 An' there I saw - wite out in the trees - 
 Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze!

 An' Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze
 Would bow an' bow, with the leaves in the breeze,
 An' waggle his whiskers an' raggledy hair,
 An' bow to me in the winder there!
 An' I 'd peek out, an' he'd peek in
 An' waggle his whiskers an' bow ag'in,
 Ist like the leaves'u'd wave in the breeze - 
 Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze!


 An' Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze,
 Seem-like, says to me: "See my bees
 A-bringin' my dinner? An' see my cup
 O' locus'-blossoms they've plum' filled up?"
 An' "Um-yum, honey!" wuz last he said,
 An' waggled his whiskers an' bowed his head;
 An' I yells, "Gimme some, won't you, please,
 Old Man Whiskery-Whee-Kum-Wheeze?"
