What shall I do with all the days and hours
 That must be counted ere I see thy face?
How shall I charm the interval that lowers
 Between this time and that sweet time of grace?

Shall I in slumber steep each weary sense,
 Weary with longing? - shall I flee away
Into past days, and with some fond pretence
 Cheat myself to forget the present day?

Shall love for thee lay on my soul the sin
 Of casting from me God's great gift of time;
Shall I these mists of memory locked within,
 Leave, and forget, life's purposes sublime?

Oh! how, or by what means, may I contrive
 To bring the hour that brings thee back more near?
How may I teach my drooping hope to live
 Until that blessed time, and thou art here?

I'll tell thee: for thy sake, I will lay hold
 Of all good aims, and consecrate to thee,
In worthy deeds, each moment that is told
 While thou, beloved one! art far from me.

For thee I will arouse my thoughts to try
 All heavenward flights, all high and holy strains;
For thy dear sake I will walk patiently
 Through these long hours, nor call their minutes pains.

I will this dreary blank of absence make
 A noble task time, and will therein strive
To follow excellence, and to o'ertake
 More good than I have won, since yet I live.

So may this doomed time build up in me
 A thousand graces which shall thus be thine;
So may my love and longing hallowed be,
 And thy dear thought an influence divine.
