This is the day whereon, confederate
 In union, was our national'ty born, -
A four-walled temple beautiful and great,
 Arising like the bringer of the morn,
 Now winged and buttressed, which the years adorn
With pinnacles of fame. Long may it stand,
 Though realms be rent, states shattered, thrones uptorn!
Long may Canadians grasp each other's hand,
Defend their nation's rights, and love their fatherland!
