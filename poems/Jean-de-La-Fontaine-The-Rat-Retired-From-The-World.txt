title: The Rat Retired From The World.
---

 The sage Levantines have a tale
 About a rat that weary grew
 Of all the cares which life assail,
 And to a Holland cheese withdrew.
 His solitude was there profound,
 Extending through his world so round.
 Our hermit lived on that within;
 And soon his industry had been
 With claws and teeth so good,
 That in his novel hermitage,
 He had in store, for wants of age,
 Both house and livelihood.
 What more could any rat desire?
 He grew fair, fat, and round.
 'God's blessings thus redound
 To those who in His vows retire.'[1]
 One day this personage devout,
 Whose kindness none might doubt,
 Was ask'd, by certain delegates
 That came from Rat-United-States,
 For some small aid, for they
 To foreign parts were on their way,
 For succour in the great cat-war.
 Ratopolis beleaguer'd sore,
 Their whole republic drain'd and poor,
 No morsel in their scrips they bore.
 Slight boon they craved, of succour sure
 In days at utmost three or four.
 'My friends,' the hermit said,
 'To worldly things I'm dead.
 How can a poor recluse
 To such a mission be of use?
 What can he do but pray
 That God will aid it on its way?
 And so, my friends, it is my prayer
 That God will have you in his care.'
 His well-fed saintship said no more,
 But in their faces shut the door.
 What think you, reader, is the service
 For which I use this niggard rat?
 To paint a monk? No, but a dervise.
 A monk, I think, however fat,
 Must be more bountiful than that.
