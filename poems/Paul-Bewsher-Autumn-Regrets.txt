That I were Keats! And with a golden pen
 Could for all time preserve these golden days
In rich and glowing verse, for poorer men,
 Who felt their wonder, but could only gaze
With silent joy upon sweet Autumn's face,
And not record in any wise its grace!
Alas! But I am even dumb as they - 
I cannot bid the fleeting hours stay,
 Nor chain one moment on a page's space.

That I were Grieg! Then, with a haunting air
 Of murmurs soft, and swelling, grand refrains
Would I express my love of Autumn fair
 With all its wealth of harvest, and warm rains:
And with fantastic melodies inspire
A memory of each mad sunset's fire
In which the day goes slowly to its death
As through the fragrant woods dim Evening's breath
 Doth soothe to sleep the drowsy songbirds' choir.

That I were Corot! Then September's gold
 Would I store up in painted treasuries
That, when the world seemed grey I could behold
 Its blazing colour with sweet memories,
And each elusive colour would be mine
That decorates these afternoons benign.
Ah! Then I could enshrine each fleeting hue
Which dyes the woodland, and enslave the blue
 Of sky and haze, with genius divine.

How sad these wishes! When I have no art
 Of poetry, or music, or of brush,
With which to calm the swelling of my heart
 By capturing the misty country's hush
In muted violins; I cannot hymn
The shadowy silence of the copses dim;
Nor can I paint September's sky-crowned hills.
Gone then, the wonder which my vision fills,
 When all the earth is bound by Winter grim!

 WESTGATE.
