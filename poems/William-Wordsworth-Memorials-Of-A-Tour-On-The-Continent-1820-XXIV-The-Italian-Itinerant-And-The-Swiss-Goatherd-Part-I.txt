I

 Now that the farewell tear is dried,
 Heaven prosper thee, be hope thy guide
 Hope be thy guide, adventurous Boy;
 The wages of thy travel, joy!
 Whether for London bound, to trill
 Thy mountain notes with simple skill;
 Or on thy head to poise a show
 Of Images in seemly row;
 The graceful form of milk-white Steed,
 Or Bird that soared with Ganymede;
 Or through our hamlets thou wilt bear
 The sightless Milton, with his hair
 Around his placid temples curled;
 And Shakespeare at his side, a freight,
 If clay could think and mind were weight,
 For him who bore the world!
 Hope be thy guide, adventurous Boy;
 The wages of thy travel, joy!

 But thou, perhaps, (alert as free
 Though serving sage philosophy)
 Wilt ramble over hill and dale,
 A Vender of the well-wrought Scale,
 Whose sentient tube instructs to time
 A purpose to a fickle clime:
 Whether thou choose this useful part,
 Or minister to finer art,
 Though robbed of many a cherished dream,
 And crossed by many a shattered scheme,
 What stirring wonders wilt thou see
 In the proud Isle of liberty!
 Yet will the Wanderer sometimes pine
 With thoughts which no delights can chase,
 Recall a Sister's last embrace,
 His Mother's neck entwine;
 Nor shall forget the Maiden coy
 That 'would' have loved the bright-haired Boy!

 My Song, encouraged by the grace
 That beams from his ingenuous face,
 For this Adventurer scruples not
 To prophesy a golden lot;
 Due recompense, and safe return
 To Como's steeps, his happy bourne!
 Where he, aloft in garden glade,
 Shall tend, with his own dark-eyed Maid,
 The towering maize, and prop the twig
 That ill supports the luscious fig;
 Or feed his eye in paths sun-proof
 With purple of the trellis-roof,
 That through the jealous leaves escapes
 From Cadenabbia's pendent grapes.
 Oh might he tempt that Goatherd-child
 To share his wanderings! him whose look
 Even yet my heart can scarcely brook,
 So touchingly he smiled
 As with a rapture caught from heaven
 For unasked alms in pity given.
