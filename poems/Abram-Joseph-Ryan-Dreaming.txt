title: Dreaming

The moan of a wintry soul
 Melted into a summer song,
And the words, like the wavelet's roll,
 Moved murmuringly along.

And the song flowed far and away,
 Like the voice of a half-sleeping rill --
Each wave of it lit by a ray --
 But the sound was so soft and so still,

And the tone was so gentle and low,
 None heard the song till it had passed;
Till the echo that followed its flow
 Came dreamingly back from the past.

'Twas too late! -- a song never returns
 That passes our pathway unheard;
As dust lying dreaming in urns
 Is the song lying dead in a word.

For the birds of the skies have a nest,
 And the winds have a home where they sleep,
And songs, like our souls, need a rest,
 Where they murmur the while we may weep.

 *****

But songs -- like the birds o'er the foam,
 Where the storm wind is beating their breast,
Fly shoreward -- and oft find a home
 In the shelter of words where they rest.
