title: The Memorial Brass: 186-

 "Why do you weep there, O sweet lady,
 Why do you weep before that brass? -
(I'm a mere student sketching the mediaeval)
 Is some late death lined there, alas? -
Your father's? . . . Well, all pay the debt that paid he!"

 "Young man, O must I tell! - My husband's! And under
 His name I set mine, and my DEATH! -
Its date left vacant till my heirs should fill it,
 Stating me faithful till my last breath."
- "Madam, that you are a widow wakes my wonder!"

 "O wait! For last month I - remarried!
 And now I fear 'twas a deed amiss.
We've just come home. And I am sick and saddened
 At what the new one will say to this;
And will he think - think that I should have tarried?

 "I may add, surely, - with no wish to harm him -
 That he's a temper - yes, I fear!
And when he comes to church next Sunday morning,
 And sees that written . . . O dear, O dear!
- "Madam, I swear your beauty will disarm him!"
