I am serenity.Though passions beat
 Like mighty billows on my helpless heart,
I know beyond them lies the perfect sweet
 Serenity, which patience can impart.
And when wild tempests in my bosom rage,
"Peace, peace," I cry, "it is my heritage."

I am good health.Though fevers rack my brain
 And rude disorders mutilate my strength,
A perfect restoration after pain,
 I know shall be my recompense at length.
And so through grievous day and sleepless night,
"Health, health," I cry, "it is my own by right."

I am success.Though hungry, cold, ill-clad,
 I wander for awhile, I smile and say,
"It is but for a time - I shall be glad
 To-morrow, for good fortune comes my way.
God is my father, He has wealth untold,
His wealth is mine, health, happiness, and gold."
