I.

O stars that fade in amber skies
 Because ye dread the light of day,
O moon so lonely and so wise,
 Look down, and love my Love alwï¿½y;
 Salute the Lady of the May.


II.

O lark that soarest in the light
 To hail thy lord in his array,
Look down; be just; and sing aright.
 A lover claims thy song to-day
 To greet his Lady of the May.


III.

"O lady! lady!" sings the lark,
 "Thy lover's hest I do obey;
For thou art splendid after dark,
 And where thou smilest, there is day;
 And thou'rt the Lady of the May.


IV.

"The nightingale's a friend of mine,
 And yesternight she flew my way.
'Awake,' she cried, 'at morning shine
 And sing for me thy blythest lay
 To greet the Lady of the May.'


V.

"'And tell her, tell her, gentle one,
 While thou attun'st thy morning lay,
That I will sing at set of sun
 Another song for thy sweet fay,
 Because she's Lady of the May.'


VI.

"And lo I come," the lark in air,
 Self-pois'd and free, did seem to say,
"I come to greet thy lady's hair
 And call its beams the light of day
 Which decks thy Lady of the May."


VII.

Oh, thank thee, bird that singest well!
 For all thou say'st and still would'st say
And for the thoughts which Philomel
 Intends to trill, in roundelay,
 To greet my Lady of the May.


VIII.

We two (my Love and I) are one,
 And so shall be, for aye and aye.
Go, take my homage to the sun,
 And bid him shine his best to-day,
 To crown my Lady of the May!
