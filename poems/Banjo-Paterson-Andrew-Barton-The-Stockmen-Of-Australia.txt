title: The Stockmen Of Australia
---

The stockmen of Australia, what rowdy boys are they,
They will curse and swear an hurricane if you come in their way.
They dash along the forest on black, bay, brown, or grey,
And the stockmen of Australia, hard-riding boys are they.

Chorus: And the stockmen, &amp;c.

By constant feats of horsemanship, they procure for us our grub,
And supply us with the fattest beef by hard work in the scrub.
To muster up the cattle they cease not night nor day,
And the stockmen of Australia, hard-riding boys are they.

Chorus: And the stockmen, &amp;c.

Just mark him as he jogs along, his stockwhip on his knee,
His white mole pants and polished boots and jaunty cabbage- tree.
His horsey-pattern Crimean shirt of colours bright and gay,
And the stockmen of Australia, what dressy boys are they.

Chorus: And the stockmen, &amp;c.

If you should chance to lose yourself and drop upon his camp,
He�s there reclining on the ground, be it dry or be it damp.
He�ll give you hearty welcome, and a stunning pot of tea,
For the stockmen of Australia, good-natured boys are they.

Chorus: For the stockmen, &amp;c.

If down to Sydney you should go, and there a stockman meet,
Remark the sly looks cast on him as he roams through the street.
From the shade of lovely bonnets steal forth those glances gay,
For the stockmen of Australia, the ladies� pets are they.

Chorus: For the stockmen, &amp;c.

Whatever fun is going on, the stockman will be there,
Be it theatre or concert, or dance or fancy fair.
To join in the amusements be sure he won�t delay,
For the stockmen of Australia, light-hearted boys are they.

 Chorus: For the stockmen, &amp;c.

Then here�s a health to every lass, and let the toast go round,
To as jolly a set of fellows as ever yet were found.
And all good luck be with them, for ever and to-day,
Here�s to the stockmen of Australia�hip, hip, hooray!

 Chorus: Here�s to the stockmen, &amp;c.
