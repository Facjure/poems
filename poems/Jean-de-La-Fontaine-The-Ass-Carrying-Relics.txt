title: The Ass Carrying Relics.

[1]

 An ass, with relics for his load,
 Supposed the worship on the road
 Meant for himself alone,
 And took on lofty airs,
 Receiving as his own
 The incense and the prayers.
 Some one, who saw his great mistake,
 Cried, 'Master Donkey, do not make
 Yourself so big a fool.
 Not you they worship, but your pack;
 They praise the idols on your back,
 And count yourself a paltry tool.'

 'Tis thus a brainless magistrate
 Is honour'd for his robe of state.
