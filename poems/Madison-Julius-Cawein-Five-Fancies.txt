I

THE GLADIOLAS.

As tall as the lily, as tall as the rose,
 And almost as tall as the hollyhocks,
Ranked breast to breast in sentinel rows
 Stand the gladiola stocks.

And some are red as the humming-bird's blood
 And some are pied as the butterfly race,
And each is shaped like a velvet hood
 Gold-lined with delicate lace.

For you know the goblins that come like musk
 To tumble and romp in the flowers' laps,
When you see big fire-fly eyes in the dusk,
 Hang there their goblin caps.


II

THE MORNING-GLORIES.

They bloom up the fresh, green trellis
 In airy, vigorous ease,
And their fragrant, sensuous honey
 Is best beloved of the bees.

Oh! the rose knows the dainty secret
 How the morning-glory blows,
For the rose told me the secret,
 And the jessamine told the rose.

And the jessamine said at midnight,
 Ere the red cock woke and crew,
That the fays of queen Titania
 Came there to bathe in the dew.

And the merry moonlight glistened
 On wet, long, yellow hair,
And their feet on the flowers drowsy
 Trod softer than any air.

And their petticoats, gay as bubbles,
 They hung up every one
On the morning-glories' tendrils
 Till their moonlight bath were done.

But the red cock crew too early,
 And the fays left hurriedly,
And this is why in the morning
 Their petticoats there you see.


III

THE TIGER-LILY.

A sultan proud and tawny
 At elegant ease he stands,
With his bare throat brown and scrawny,
 And his indolent, leaf-like hands.

And the eunuch tulips that listen
 In their gaudy turbans so,
With their scimetar leaves that glisten,
 Are guards of his seraglio;

Where sultana roses musky,
 Voluptuous in houri charms,
With their bold breasts deep and dusky,
 Impatiently wait his arms.

Tall, beautiful, sad, and slender,
 His Greek-girl dancing slaves,
For the white-limbed lilies tender
 His royal hand he waves.

While he watches them, softly smiling,
 His favorite rose that hour
With a butterfly gallant is wiling
 In her attar-scented bower.


IV

VENGEANCE.

I

Let it sink, let it sink
On the pungent-petaled pink
By those poppy puffs;
Fairy-fashioned downiness,
Light, weak moth in furry dress
Of white fluffy stuffs.


II

Where the thin light slipping sweet
Dimples prints of Fairy feet
On the white-rose blooms,
One dim blossom delicate
Droops a face all pale with hate,
Dead with sick perfumes.


III

And I read the riddle wove
In this rose's course of love
For the fickle pink: - 
Thou the rose's phantom art
Stealing to the pink's false heart
Vampire-like to drink.


V

A DEAD LILY.

I

The South had saluted her mouth
Till her mouth was sweet with the South.

II

And the North with his breathings low
Made the blood in her veins like his snow.

III

And the West with his smiles and his art
Poured his honey of life in her heart.

IV

And the East had in whisperings told
His secrets more precious than gold.

V

So she grew to a beautiful thought
Which a godhead of love had wrought.

VI

As strange how the power begot it
As why - but to kill it and rot it.
