title: Farewell To The Children.
---

 In the early summer morning
I stand and watch them come,
 The children to the school-house;
They chatter and laugh and hum.

 The little boys with satchels
Slung round them, and the girls
 Each with hers swinging in her hand;
I love their sunny curls.

 I love to see them playing,
Romping and shouting with glee,
 The boys and girls together,
Simple, fearless, free.

 I love to see them marching
In squads, in file, in line,
 Advancing and retreating,
Tramping, keeping time.

 Sometimes a little lad
With a bright brave face I'll see,
 And a wistful yearning wonder
Comes stealing over me.

 For once I too had a darling;
I dreamed what he should do,
 And surely he'd have had, I thought,
Just such a face as you.

 And I, I dreamed to see him
Noble and brave and strong,
 Loving the light, the lovely,
Hating the dark, the wrong, - 

 Loving the poor, the People,
Ready to smile and give
 Blood and brain to their service,
For them to die or live!

 No matter, O little darlings!
Little boys, you shall be
 My citizens for faithful labour,
My soldiers for victory!

 Little girls, I charge you
Be noble sweethearts, wives,
 Mothers - comrades the sweetest,
Fountains of happy lives!

 Farewell, O little darlings!
Far away, - with strangers, too - 
 He sleeps, the little darling,
I dreamed to see like you.

 And I, O little darlings,
I have many miles to go,
 And where I too may stop and sleep,
And when, I do not know.

 But I charge you to remember
The love, the trust I had,
 That you'd be noble, fearless, free,
And make your country glad!

 That you should toil together,
Face whatever yet shall be,
 My citizens for faithful labour,
My soldiers for victory!

 I charge you to remember;
I bless you with my hand,
 And I know the hour is coming
When you shall understand:

 When you shall understand too,
Why, as I said farewell,
 Although my lips were smiling,
The shining tears down fell.
