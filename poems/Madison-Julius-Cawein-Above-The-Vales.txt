 We went by ways of bygone days,
 Up mountain heights of story,
 Where lost in vague, historic haze,
 Tradition, crowned with battle-bays,
 Sat 'mid her ruins hoary.

 Where wing to wing the eagles cling
 And torrents have their sources,
 War rose with bugle voice to sing
 Of wild spear thrust, and broadsword swing,
 And rush of men and horses.

 Then deep below, where orchards show
 A home here, here a steeple,
 We heard a simple shepherd go,
 Singing, beneath the afterglow,
 A love-song of the people.

 As in the trees the song did cease,
 With matron eyes and holy
 Peace, from the cornlands of increase.
 And rose-beds of love's victories,
 Spake, smiling, of the lowly.
