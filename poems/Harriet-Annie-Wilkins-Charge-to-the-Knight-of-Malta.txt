title: Charge to the Knight of Malta

Air--Stephenos



Lo, a knight in armour standing,
Ready for the foe;
Thee we greet, belov'd Companion,
Thee we know.

Keep thine oath, oh new made soldier,
Pledged in heaven's sight;
Nor forget the vow thou'st taken,
Malta's knight.

By the banner, o'er us waving,
By thy lance at rest,
Chiefly by that Cross emblazoned
On thy breast.

In the heat of danger's trial,
Dare the fiercest fight;
No desertion, no denial,
Right or life!

See thou turn not from the conflict,
On the battle field,
Though men bear a dying soldier
On thy shield.

Let thy strong arm shield the helpless,
And the feeble save;
Mercy's voice the true knight knoweth,
And the brave.

Welcome, dear Sir Knight, thrice welcome!
To our tented field;
God will aid us till the final
Foe shall yield.

We are pledged unto His kingdom,
Who for us hath borne
Cross and spear, for us did suffer
Crown of thorn.

Then, for Him who rose triumphant
To the heavenly Lamp,
Gird thy sword though night surround thee,
Wild and damp.

When at last, in mortal weakness,
Sword and spear must fall,
Christ, unto Thy Grand Encampment,
Take us all.
