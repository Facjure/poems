The air is dark and fragrant
 With memories of a shower,
And sanctified with stillness
 By this most holy hour.

The leaves forget to whisper
 Of soft and secret things,
And every bird is silent,
 With folded eyes and wings.

O blessed hour of midnight,
 Of sleep and of release,
Thou yieldest to the toiler
 The wages of thy peace.

And I, who have not laboured,
 Nor borne the heat of noon,
Receive thy tranquil quiet--
 An undeserved boon.

Yes, truly God is gracious,
 Who makes His sun to shine
Upon the good and evil,
 And idle lives like mine.

Upon the just and unjust
 He sends His rain to fall,
And gives this hour of blessing
 Freely alike to all.
