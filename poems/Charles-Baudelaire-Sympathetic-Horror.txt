�From that sky livid, bizarre
as your tortured destiny,
what thoughts fill your empty heart,
Freethinker, answer me.�

Insatiable and avid
for vague and obscure skies,
I�ll not groan like Ovid,
banned from Rome and paradise.

Skies, shores split and seamed,
my pride�s mirrored in you:
your clouds in mourning, too,

are the hearses of my dreams,
Hell�s reflected in your light,
where my heart takes delight.
