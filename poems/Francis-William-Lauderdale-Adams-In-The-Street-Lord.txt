 You have done well, we say it. You are dead,
And, of the man that with the right hand takes
 Less than the left hand gives, let it be said
He has done something for our wretched sakes.
 For those to whom you gave their daily bread
Rancid with God-loathed "charity," their drink
 Putrid with man-loathed "sin," we bow our head
Grateful, as the great hearse goes by, and think.
 Yes, you have fed the flesh and starved the soul
Of thousands of us; you have taught too well
 The rich are little gods beyond control,
Save of your big God of the heaven and hell.
 We thank you. This was pretty once, and right.
 Now it wears rather thin. My lord, good night!
