Now the "rosy morn appearing"
 Floods with light the dazzled heaven;
And the schoolboy groans on hearing
 That eternal clock strike seven:-
Now the waggoner is driving
 Towards the fields his clattering wain;
Now the bluebottle, reviving,
 Buzzes down his native pane.

But to me the morn is hateful:
 Wearily I stretch my legs,
Dress, and settle to my plateful
 Of (perhaps inferior) eggs.
Yesterday Miss Crump, by message,
 Mentioned "rent," which "p'raps I'd pay;"
And I have a dismal presage
 That she'll call, herself, to-day.

Once, I breakfasted off rosewood,
 Smoked through silver-mounted pipes -
Then how my patrician nose would
 Turn up at the thought of "swipes!"
Ale, - occasionally claret, -
 Graced my luncheon then:- and now
I drink porter in a garret,
 To be paid for heaven knows how.

When the evening shades are deepened,
 And I doff my hat and gloves,
No sweet bird is there to "cheep and
 Twitter twenty million loves:"
No dark-ringleted canaries
 Sing to me of "hungry foam;"
No imaginary "Marys"
 Call fictitious "cattle home."

Araminta, sweetest, fairest!
 Solace once of every ill!
How I wonder if thou bearest
 Mivins in remembrance still!
If that Friday night is banished
 Yet from that retentive mind,
When the others somehow vanished,
 And we two were left behind:-

When in accents low, yet thrilling,
 I did all my love declare;
Mentioned that I'd not a shilling -
 Hinted that we need not care:
And complacently you listened
 To my somewhat long address -
(Listening, at the same time, isn't
 Quite the same as saying Yes).

Once, a happy child, I carolled
 O'er green lawns the whole day through,
Not unpleasingly apparelled
 In a tightish suit of blue:-
What a change has now passed o'er me!
 Now with what dismay I see
Every rising morn before me!
 Goodness gracious, patience me!

And I'll prowl, a moodier Lara,
 Through the world, as prowls the bat,
And habitually wear a
 Cypress wreath around my hat:
And when Death snuffs out the taper
 Of my Life, (as soon he must),
I'll send up to every paper,
 "Died, T. Mivins; of disgust."
