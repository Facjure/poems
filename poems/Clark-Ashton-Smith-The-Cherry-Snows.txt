title: The Cherry-Snows

The cherry-snows are falling now;
 Down from the blossom-clouded sky
Of zephyr-troubled twig and bough,
 In widely settling whirls they fly.

The orchard earth, unclothed and brown,
 Is wintry-hued with petals bright;
E'en as the snow they glimmer down;
 Brief as the snow's their stainless white.
