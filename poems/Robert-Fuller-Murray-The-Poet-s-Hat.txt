title: The Poet's Hat
---

The rain had fallen, the Poet arose,
 He passed through the doorway into the street,
A strong wind lifted his hat from his head,
 And he uttered some words that were far from sweet.
And then he started to follow the chase,
 And put on a spurt that was wild and fleet,
It made the people pause in a crowd,
 And lay odds as to which would beat.

The street cad scoffed as he hunted the hat,
 The errand-boy shouted hooray!
The scavenger stood with his broom in his hand,
 And smiled in a very rude way;
And the clergyman thought, 'I have heard many words,
 But never, until to-day,
Did I hear any words that were quite so bad
 As I heard that young man say.'
