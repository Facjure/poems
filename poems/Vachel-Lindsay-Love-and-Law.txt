title: Love and Law

 True Love is founded in rocks of Remembrance
 In stones of Forbearance and mortar of Pain.
 The workman lays wearily granite on granite,
 And bleeds for his castle 'mid sunshine and rain.

 Love is not velvet, not all of it velvet,
 Not all of it banners, not gold-leaf alone.
 'Tis stern as the ages and old as Religion.
 With Patience its watchword, and Law for its throne.
