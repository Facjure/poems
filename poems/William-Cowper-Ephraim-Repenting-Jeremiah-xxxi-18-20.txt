---

My God, till I received thy stroke,
How like a beast was I!
So unaccustom�d to the yoke,
So backward to comply.


With grief my just reproach I bear,
Shame fills me at the thought;
How frequent my rebellions were!
What wickedness I wrought!


Thy merciful restraint I scorn�d,
And left the pleasant road;
Yet turn me, and I shall be turn�d,
Thou art the Lord my God.


�Is Ephraim banish�d from my thoughts,
Or vile in my esteem?
No,� saith the Lord, �with all his faults,
I still remember him.


�Is he a dear and pleasant child?
Yes, dear and pleasant still;
Though sin his foolish heart beguiled,
And he withstood my will.


�My sharp rebuke has laid him low,
He seeks my face again;
My pity kindles at his woe,
He shall not seek in vain.�
