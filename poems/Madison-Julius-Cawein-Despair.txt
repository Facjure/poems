 Shut in with phantoms of life's hollow hopes,
 And shadows of old sins satiety slew,
 And the young ghosts of the dead dreams love knew,
 Out of the day into the night she gropes.
 Behind her, high the silvered summit slopes
 Of strength and faith, she will not turn to view;
 But towards the cave of weakness, harsh of hue,
 She goes, where all the dropsied horror ropes.
 There is a voice of waters in her ears,
 And on her brow a wind that never dies:
 One is the anguish of desired tears;
 One is the sorrow of unuttered sighs;
 And, burdened with the immemorial years,
 Downward she goes with never lifted eyes.
