England is a cosy little country,
Excepting for the draughts along the floor.
And that is why you�re told,
When the passages are cold:
�Darling, you�ve forgot to shut the Door!�

The Awful East Wind blows it
Pussy or, the Hearthrug shows it,
Aunty at the Writing-table knows it
�Darling, you�ve forgot to shut the Door!�

Shut shut shut the Door, my darling!
Always shut the Door behind you, but
You can go when you are old
Where there isn�t any cold
So there isn�t any Door that need be shut!
And
The deep Verandah shows it
The pale Magnolia knows it
And the bold, white Trumpet-flower blows it:
There isn�t any Door that need be shut!

The piping Tree-toad knows it
The midnight Firefly shows it
And the Beams of the Moon disclose it:
There isn�t any Door that need be shut!

The milky Beaches know it
The silky Breezes blow it
And the Shafts of the Sunrise show it:
There isn�t any Door that need be shut!
