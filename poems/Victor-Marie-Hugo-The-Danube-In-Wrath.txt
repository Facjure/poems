("Quoi! ne pouvez-vous vivre ensemble?")

[XXXV., June, 1828.]


The River Deity upbraids his Daughters, the contributary Streams: - 

Ye daughters mine! will naught abate
Your fierce interminable hate?
Still am I doomed to rue the fate
That such unfriendly neighbors made?
The while ye might, in peaceful cheer,
Mirror upon your waters clear,
Semlin! thy Gothic steeples dear,
And thy bright minarets, Belgrade!
