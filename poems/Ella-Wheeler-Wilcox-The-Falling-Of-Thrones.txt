Above the din of commerce, above the clamour and rattle
 Of labour disputing with riches, of Anarchists' threats and groans,
Above the hurry and hustle and roar of that bloodless battle,
 Where men are fighting for riches, I hear the falling of thrones.

I see no savage host, I hear no martial drumming,
 But down in the dust at our feet lie the useless crowns of kings;
And the mighty spirit of Progress is steadily coming, coming,
 And the flag of one republic abroad to the world he flings.

The Universal Republic, where worth, not birth, is royal;
 Where the lowliest born may climb on a self-made ladder to fame;
Where the highest and proudest born, if he be not true and loyal,
 Shall find no masking title to cover and gild his shame.

Not with the bellow of guns and not with sabres whetting,
 But with growing minds of men is waged this swordless fray;
While over the dim horizon the sun of royalty, setting,
 Lights, with a dying splendour, the humblest toiler's way.
