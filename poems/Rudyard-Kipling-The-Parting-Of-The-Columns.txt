We�ve rode and fought and ate and drunk as rations* come to hand,
Together for a year and more around this stinkin� land:
Now you are goin� home again, but we must see it through.
We needn�t tell we liked you well. Good-bye, good luck to you!

You �ad no special call to come, and so you doubled out,
And learned us how to camp and cook an� steal a horse and scout.
Whatever game we fancied most, you joyful played it too,
And rather better on the whole. Good-bye, good luck to you!

There isn�t much we �ave n�t shared, since Kruger cut and run,
The same old work the same old skoff the same old dust and sun;
The same old chance that laid us out, or winked an� let us through;
The same old Life, the same old Death. Good-bye, good luck to you!

Our blood �as truly mixed with yours, all down the Red Cross train.
We�ve bit the same thermometer in Bloeming-typhoidtein.**
We�ve �ad the same old temp�rature, the same relapses too,
The same old saw-backed fever-chart. Good-bye, good luck to you!

But �twasn�t merely this an� that (which all the world may know),
�Twas how you talked an� looked at things which made us like you so.
All independent, queer an� odd, but most amazin� new,
My word! you shook us up to rights. Good-bye, good luck to you!

Think o� the stories round the fire, the tales along the trek,
O� Calgary an� Wellin�ton, an� Sydney and Quebec;
Of mine an� farm, an� ranch an� run, an� moose an� cariboo,
An� parrots peckin� lambs to death! Good-bye, good luck to you!

We�ve seen your �ome by word o� mouth, we�ve watched your rivers shine,
We�ve �eard your bloomin� forests blow of eucalip� and pine;
Your young, gay countries north and south, we feel we own �em too,
For they was made by rank an� file. Good-bye, good luck to you,

We�ll never read the papers now without inquirin� first
For word from all those friendly dorps where you was born an� nursed.
Why, Dawson, Galle, an� Montreal, Port Darwin, Timaru,
They�re only just across the road! Good-bye, good luck to you!

Good-bye!, So, long! Don�t lose yourselves, nor us, nor all kind friends,
But tell the girls your side the drift we�re comin�, when it ends!
Good-bye, you bloomin� Atlases! You�ve taught us somethin� new:
The world�s no bigger than a kraal. Good-bye, good luck to you!
