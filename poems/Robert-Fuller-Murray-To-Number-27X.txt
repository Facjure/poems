 Beloved Peeler! friend and guide
And guard of many a midnight reeler,
 None worthier, though the world is wide,
 Beloved Peeler.

 Thou from before the swift four-wheeler
Didst pluck me, and didst thrust aside
 A strongly built provision-dealer

 Who menaced me with blows, and cried
'Come on! come on!'O Paian, Healer,
 Then but for thee I must have died,
 Beloved Peeler!
