 The moon, like a round device
 On a shadowy shield of war,
 Hangs white in a heaven of ice
 With a solitary star.

 The wind is sunk to a sigh,
 And the waters are stern with frost;
 And gray, in the eastern sky,
 The last snow-cloud is lost.

 White fields, that are winter-starved,
 Black woods, that are winter-fraught,
 Cold, harsh as a face death-carved
 With the iron of some black thought.
