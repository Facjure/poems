title: An East Wind
---

The glitter of wheels far down the street
 (Ah me, and alack a day.)
And I heard the thud of his horse's feet
 Beating a roundelay.
And I felt a little song coming, coming
Over my lips as humming, humming,
 I turned my eyes that way.

Somebody passed, who was wont to pause:
 (Ah me, and alack a day.)
He bowed and smiled; yet for some cause
 The mirth went out of my lay.
A wind from the east rose, sighing, sighing,
I felt my little song dying, dying,
 She laughed as they rode away.
