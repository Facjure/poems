title: On The Receipt Of A Hamper.

(in the manner of homer.)


The straw-stuff�d hamper with his ruthless steel
He open�d, cutting sheer th� inserted cords
Which bound the lid and lip secure. Forth came
The rustling package first, bright straw of wheat,
Or oats, or barley; next a bottle green
Throat-full, clear spirits the contents, distill�d
Drop after drop odorous, by the art
Of the fair mother of his friend�the Rose.
