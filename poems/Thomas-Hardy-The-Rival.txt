 I determined to find out whose it was -
 The portrait he looked at so, and sighed;
Bitterly have I rued my meanness
And wept for it since he died!

 I searched his desk when he was away,
 And there was the likeness - yes, my own!
Taken when I was the season's fairest,
And time-lines all unknown.

 I smiled at my image, and put it back,
 And he went on cherishing it, until
I was chafed that he loved not the me then living,
But that past woman still.

 Well, such was my jealousy at last,
 I destroyed that face of the former me;
Could you ever have dreamed the heart of woman
Would work so foolishly!
