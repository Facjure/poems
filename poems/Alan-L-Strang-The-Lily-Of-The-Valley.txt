title: The Lily Of The Valley
---

I've a lily of the Valley
That I'm keeping here for you;
I care for and protect it,
And water it with dew.
It is a living emblem
Of the wonderful domain,
Where all is pure and love-like,
And where we feel no pain.

Yes, the Lily of the Valley
Is a tie twixt you and me;
For every time you see one
Think how happy I must be.
I'm an atom of the infinite,
How wonderful it seems;
Yet from your sphere the finite
But a thin veil intervenes.
