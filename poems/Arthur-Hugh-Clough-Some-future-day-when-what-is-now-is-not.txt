title: Some future day when what is now is not
---

Some future day when what is now is not,
When all old faults and follies are forgot,
And thoughts of difference passed like dreams away,
We�ll meet again, upon some future day.

When all that hindered, all that vexed our love,
As tall rank weeds will climb the blade above,
When all but it has yielded to decay,
We�ll meet again upon some future day.

When we have proved, each on his course alone,
The wider world, and learnt what�s now unknown,
Have made life clear, and worked out each a way,
We�ll meet again, we shall have much to say.

With happier mood, and feelings born anew,
Our boyhood�s bygone fancies we�ll review,
Talk o�er old talks, play as we used to play,
And meet again, on many a future day.

Some day, which oft our hearts shall yearn to see,
In some far year, though distant yet to be,
Shall we indeed, ye winds and waters, say!
Meet yet again, upon some future day?
