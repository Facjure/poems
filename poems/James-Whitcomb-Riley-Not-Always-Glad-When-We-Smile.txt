title: Not Always Glad When We Smile
---

We are not always glad when we smile:
 Though we wear a fair face and are gay,
And the world we deceive
May not ever believe
 We could laugh in a happier way. -
Yet, down in the deeps of the soul,
 Ofttimes, with our faces aglow,
There's an ache and a moan
That we know of alone,
And as only the hopeless may know.

We are not always glad when we smile, -
 For the heart, in a tempest of pain,
May live in the guise
Of a smile in the eyes
 As a rainbow may live in the rain;
And the stormiest night of our woe
 May hang out a radiant star
Whose light in the sky
Of despair is a lie
As black as the thunder-clouds are.

We are not always glad when we smile! -
 But the conscience is quick to record,
All the sorrow and sin
We are hiding within
 Is plain in the sight of the Lord:
And ever, O ever, till pride
 And evasion shall cease to defile
The sacred recess
Of the soul, we confess
We are not always glad when we smile.
