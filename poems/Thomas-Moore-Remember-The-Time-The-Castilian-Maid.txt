title: Remember The Time. (The Castilian Maid.)
---

Remember the time, in La Mancha's shades,
When our moments so blissfully flew;
When you called me the flower of Castilian maids,
And I blushed to be called so by you;
When I taught you to warble the gay seguadille.
And to dance to the light castanet;
Oh, never, dear youth, let you roam where you will,
The delight of those moments forget.

They tell me, you lovers from Erin's green isle,
Every hour a new passion can feel;
And that soon, in the light of some lovelier smile.
You'll forget the poor maid of Castile.
But they know not how brave in battle you are,
Or they never could think you would rove;
For 'tis always the spirit most gallant in war
That is fondest and truest in Love.
