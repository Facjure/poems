Short space shall be hereafter
 Ere April brings the hour
Of weeping and of laughter,
 Of sunshine and of shower,
Of groaning and of gladness,
Of singing and of sadness,
Of melody and madness,
 Of all sweet things and sour.

Sweet to the blithe bucolic
 Who knows nor cribs nor crams,
Who sees the frisky frolic
 Of lanky little lambs;
 But sour beyond expression
To one in deep depression
Who sees the closing session
 And imminent exams.

He cannot hear the singing
 Of birds upon the bents,
Nor watch the wildflowers springing,
 Nor smell the April scents.
He gathers grief with grinding,
Foul food of sorrow finding
In books of dreary binding
 And drearier contents.

One hope alone sustains him,
 And no more hopes beside,
One trust alone restrains him
 From shocking suicide;
 He will not play nor palter
With hemlock or with halter,
He will not fear nor falter,
 Whatever chance betide.

He knows examinations
 Like all things else have ends,
And then come vast vacations
 And visits to his friends,
And youth with pleasure yoking,
And joyfulness and joking,
And smilingness and smoking,
 For grief to make amends.
