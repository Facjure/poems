Lingerie,
black pumps
a navel creamy enough
to drown a kitten - 
the clothes assemble
in microwave fashion
 - crackle of fire - 
the silver pants zoom across legs
with curves so caress bound
a formula racing driver
might tumble.

As eyes rise
in jade lantern face
&amp; hair is brushed
with all sheen aside,
the lady is more than
a Godiva
or Goldwyn-Mayer cinematic production,
this oasis of sparks,
twin peaks of McKinley-Matterhorn fame,
her calendar of words
pulling Oil of Olay
&amp; perfumed honey thru
each studied remark.
