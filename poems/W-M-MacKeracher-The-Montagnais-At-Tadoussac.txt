(From the prose of Parkman.)

The lodges of the Montagnais were there,
 Who reaped the harvest of the woods and rocks -
Skins of the moose and cariboo and bear,
 Fur of the beaver, marten, otter, fox.
From where the shivering nomad lurks among
 The stunted forests south of Hudson's Bay
They piloted their frail canoes along
 By many a tributary's devious way;

Then between mountains stern as Teneriffe
 Their confluent flotillas glided down
The Saguenay, and pass'd beneath the cliff
 Whose shaggy brows athwart the zenith frown,
And reach'd the Bay of Trinity, dark, lone,
 And silent as the tide of Acheron.
