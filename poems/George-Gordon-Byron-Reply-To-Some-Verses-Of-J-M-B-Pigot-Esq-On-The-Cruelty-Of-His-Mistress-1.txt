1.

Why, Pigot, complain
Of this damsel's disdain,
Why thus in despair do you fret?
For months you may try,
Yet, believe me, a sigh 
Will never obtain a coquette.


2.

 Would you teach her to love?
 For a time seem to rove;
At first she may frown in a pet;
 But leave her awhile,
 She shortly will smile,
And then you may kiss your coquette.


3.

 For such are the airs
 Of these fanciful fairs,
They think all our homage a debt:
 Yet a partial neglect 
 Soon takes an effect,
And humbles the proudest coquette.


4.

 Dissemble your pain,
 And lengthen your chain,
And seem her hauteur to regret; 
 If again you shall sigh,
 She no more will deny,
That yours is the rosy coquette.


5.

 If still, from false pride, 
 Your pangs she deride,
This whimsical virgin forget;
 Some other admire,
 Who will melt with your fire,
And laugh at the little coquette.


6.

 For me, I adore
 Some twenty or more,
And love them most dearly; but yet,
 Though my heart they enthral,
 I'd abandon them all,
Did they act like your blooming coquette.


7.

 No longer repine,
 Adopt this design, 
And break through her slight-woven net!
 Away with despair,
 No longer forbear
To fly from the captious coquette.


8.

Then quit her, my friend!
Your bosom defend,
Ere quite with her snares you're beset:
Lest your deep-wounded heart,
When incens'd by the smart,
Should lead you to curse the coquette.
