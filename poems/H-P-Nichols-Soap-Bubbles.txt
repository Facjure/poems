"O George! how large your bubble is!
Its colors, too, how bright!
Just like the rainbow that we saw
On high, the other night.

"Now throw it off, and let it float
Like fairies in the air!
It's broken, Georgie; never mind,
But blow another there."

Their mother, just within the door,
Smiled at their childish play,--
A smile, but yet a thoughtful one,
That seemed these words to say:

"My little Georgie, bubbles burst,
And are but empty air;
I would that you might love the things
That last forever fair.

"And ever may my darling Kate
A trusting spirit bear,
And, when one cherished hope has fled,
Yet find another there."
