In the dawn of the day when the sea and the earth
 Reflected the sunrise above,
I set forth with a heart full of courage and mirth
 To seek for the Kingdom of Love.
I asked of a Poet I met on the way
 Which cross-road would lead me aright;
And he said "Follow me, and ere long you shall see
 Its glittering turrets of light."

And soon in the distance a city shone fair.
 "Look yonder," he said; "How it gleams!"
But alas! for the hopes that were doomed to despair,
 It was only the "Kingdom of Dreams."
Then the next man I asked was a gay Cavalier,
 And he said: "Follow me, follow me";
And with laughter and song we went speeding along
 By the shores of Life's beautiful sea.

Then we came to a valley more tropical far
 Than the wonderful vale of Cashmere,
And I saw from a bower a face like a flower
 Smile out on the gay Cavalier;
And he said: "We have come to humanity's goal:
 Here love and delight are intense."
But alas and alas! for the hopes of my soul - 
 It was only the "Kingdom of Sense."

As I journeyed more slowly I met on the road
 A coach with retainers behind;
And they said: "Follow me, for our Lady's abode
 Belongs in that realm, you will find."
'Twas a grand dame of fashion, a newly-made bride,
 I followed, encouraged and bold;
But my hopes died away like the last gleams of day,
 For we came to the "Kingdom of Gold."

At the door of a cottage I asked a fair maid.
 "I have heard of that realm," she replied;
"But my feet never roam from the 'Kingdom of Home,'
 So I know not the way," and she sighed.
I looked on the cottage; how restful it seemed!
 And the maid was as fair as a dove.
Great light glorified my soul as I cried:
 "Why, Home is the 'Kingdom of Love'!"
