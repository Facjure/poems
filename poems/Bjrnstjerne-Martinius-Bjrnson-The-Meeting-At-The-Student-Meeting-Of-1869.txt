(See Note 38)

Thoughts toward one another coursing
 To their pole must run,
Hearts that meet, all bonds are forcing,
 Like the springtime sun.
Though to-day too heavy sorrow
 Dull the mind of youth,
Higher on the meeting's morrow
 Roll the tides of truth.

Though each man with courage fired
 Hundreds forward bore,
Though a thousand died inspired,
 There is need of more.
May a Northern Spring come blowing
 Over wood and field,
Wake the hundred thousands, knowing
 Meeting-hour revealed!

Hail! A Northern day is written
 In the brightening sky;
Darksome dread, that erst had smitten,
 Flees, now dawn is nigh.
After Gjallar-horn blasts hollow,
 Tears and shame and blood,
As so often, now shall follow
 Full the spirit's flood.

In our people's life deep-seated
 This is felt each day:
Who grows stronger when defeated,
 Victor stands for aye.
Our Spring-meeting's fullness swells now,
 Bearing prophecy
Of the Spring whose hope upwells now:
 Hail, the Northern three!
