It is time for bed, so the nurse declares,
 But I slip off to the nook,
The cozy nook at the head of the stairs,
 Where daddy's reading his book.

"I want to sit here awhile on your knee,"
 I say, as I toast my feet,
"And I want you to pop some corn for me,
 And give me an apple sweet."

I tickle him under the chin - just so - 
 And I say, "Please can't I, dad?"
Then I kiss his mouth so he can't say no
 To his own little black-eyed lad.

"You can't have a pony this year at all,"
 Says my stingy Uncle Joe,
After promising it - and there's the stall
 Fixed ready for it, you know.

One can't depend on his uncle, I see,
 It's daddies that are the best,
And I find mine and climb up on his knee
 As he takes his smoke and rest.

I tickle him under the chin - just so - 
 And I say, "Please can't I, dad?"
Then I kiss his mouth so he can't say no
 To his own little black-eyed lad.

I want to skate, and oh, what a fuss
 For fear I'll break through the ice!
This woman that keeps our house for us,
 She isn't what I call nice.

She wants a boy to be just like a girl,
 To play in the house all day,
Keep his face all clean and his hair in curl,
 But dad doesn't think that way.

I tickle him under the chin - just so - 
 And I say, "Please can't I, dad?"
Then I kiss his mouth so he can't say no
 To his own little black-eyed lad.

"You're growing so big," says my dad to me.
 "Soon be a man, I suppose,
Too big to climb on your old dad's knee
 And toast your ten little toes."

Then his voice it gets the funniest shake,
 And oh, but he hugs me tight!
I say, when I can't keep my eyes awake,
 "Let me sleep with you to-night."

I tickle him under the chin - just so - 
 And I say, "Please can't I, dad?"
Then I kiss his mouth so he can't say no
 To his own little black-eyed lad.
