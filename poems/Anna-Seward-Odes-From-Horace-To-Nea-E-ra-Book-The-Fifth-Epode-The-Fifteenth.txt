 'T was night - the moon, upon her sapphire throne,
 High o'er the waning stars serenely shone,
 When thou, false Nymph, determin'd to prophane
 Them, and each Power that rules the earth, and main,
 As thy soft, snowy arms about me twin'd,
 Close as round oaks the clasping ivies wind,
 Swore, while the gaunt wolf shall infest the lea,
 And red Orion vex the wintry sea,
 While gales shall fan Apollo's floating locks,
 That shed their golden light o'er hills and rocks,
 So long thy breast should burn with purest fires,
 With mutual hopes, and with unchang'd desires.

Perjur'd Nea[=e]ra! thou shalt one day prove
 The worth, the vengeance of my slighted love;
 For O! if Manhood steels, if Honor warms,
 Horace shall fly, shall scorn thy faithless charms;
 Seek some bright Maid, whose soul for him shall glow,
 Nor art, nor pride, nor wandering wishes know.

Then should'st thou languish, sigh, and weep once more,
 And with new vows his injur'd heart implore,
 Nor sighs, nor vows, nor tears shall he regard
 Cold as the snow and as the marble hard.

And THOU, triumphant Youth, so gay, so vain,
 Proud of my fate, exulting in my pain,
 Tho' on thy hills the plenteous Herd should feed,
 And rich Pactolus roll along thy mead;
 For thee tho' Science ope the varied store,
 And Beauty on thy form its graces pour,
 Ere long shalt thou, while wrongs like these degrade,
 Droop with my woes, and with my rage upbraid;
 See on a Rival's brow thy garlands worn,
 And, with her falsehood, bear my jocund scorn.
