 Allie, call the birds in,
 The birds from the sky.
 Allie calls, Allie sings,
 Down they all fly.
 First there came
 Two white doves
 Then a sparrow from his nest,
 Then a clucking bantam hen,
 Then a robin red-breast.

 Allie, call the beasts in,
 The beasts, every one.
 Allie calls, Allie sings,
 In they all run.
 First there came
 Two black lambs,
 Then a grunting Berkshire sow,
 Then a dog without a tail,
 Then a red and white cow.

 Allie, call the fish up,
 The fish from the stream.
 Allie calls, Allie sings,
 Up they all swim.
 First there came
 Two gold fish,
 A minnow and a miller's thumb,
 Then a pair of loving trout,
 Then the twisted eels come.

 Allie, call the children,
 Children from the green.
 Allie calls, Allie sings,
 Soon they run in.
 First there came
 Tom and Madge,
 Kate and I who'll not forget
 How we played by the water's edge
 Till the April sun set.
