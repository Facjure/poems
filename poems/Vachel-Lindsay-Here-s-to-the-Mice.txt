title: Here's to the Mice!
---

(Written with the hope that the socialists might yet dethrone Kaiser and Czar.)


 Here's to the mice that scare the lions,
 Creeping into their cages.
 Here's to the fairy mice that bite
 The elephants fat and wise:
 Hidden in the hay-pile while the elephant thunder rages.
 Here's to the scurrying, timid mice
 Through whom the proud cause dies.

 Here's to the seeming accident
 When all is planned and working,
 All the flywheels turning,
 Not a vassal shirking.
 Here's to the hidden tunneling thing
 That brings the mountain's groans.
 Here's to the midnight scamps that gnaw,
 Gnawing away the thrones.
