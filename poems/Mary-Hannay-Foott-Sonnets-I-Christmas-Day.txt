title: Sonnets - I - Christmas Day

O happy day, with seven-fold blessings set
Amid thy hallowed hours, the memories dear
Of childhood�s holidays, and household cheer,
When friends and kin in loving circle met,
And youth�s glad gatherings, where the sands were wet
By waves that hurt not, whilst the great cliffs near,
With storms erewhile acquaint, gave echo clear
Of voices gay and laughter gayer yet.
And graver thoughts and holier arise
Of how, �twixt that first eve and dawn of thine,
The Star ascended which hath lit our skies
More than the sun himself; and �mid the kine
The Child was born whom shepherds, and the wise;
Who came from far, and angels, called Divine.
