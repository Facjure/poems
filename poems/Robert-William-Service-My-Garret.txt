Montparnasse,

April 1914.

All day the sun has shone into my little attic, a bitter sunshine that brightened yet did not warm. And so as I toiled and toiled doggedly enough, many were the looks I cast at the three faggots I had saved to cook my evening meal. Now, however, my supper is over, my pipe alight, and as I stretch my legs before the embers I have at last a glow of comfort, a glimpse of peace.




My Garret



 Here is my Garret up five flights of stairs;
 Here's where I deal in dreams and ply in fancies,
 Here is the wonder-shop of all my wares,
 My sounding sonnets and my red romances.
 Here's where I challenge Fate and ring my rhymes,
 And grope at glory - aye, and starve at times.

 Here is my Stronghold: stout of heart am I,
 Greeting each dawn as songful as a linnet;
 And when at night on yon poor bed I lie
 (Blessing the world and every soul that's in it),
 Here's where I thank the Lord no shadow bars
 My skylight's vision of the valiant stars.

 Here is my Palace tapestried with dreams.
 Ah! though to-night ten sous are all my treasure,
 While in my gaze immortal beauty gleams,
 Am I not dowered with wealth beyond all measure?
 Though in my ragged coat my songs I sing,
 King of my soul, I envy not the king.

 Here is my Haven: it's so quiet here;
 Only the scratch of pen, the candle's flutter;
 Shabby and bare and small, but O how dear!
 Mark you - my table with my work a-clutter,
 My shelf of tattered books along the wall,
 My bed, my broken chair - that's nearly all.

 Only four faded walls, yet mine, all mine.
 Oh, you fine folks, a pauper scorns your pity.
 Look, where above me stars of rapture shine;
 See, where below me gleams the siren city . . .
 Am I not rich? - a millionaire no less,
 If wealth be told in terms of Happiness.
