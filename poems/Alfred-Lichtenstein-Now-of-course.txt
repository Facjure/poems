Now of course I put on my straw hat.
Rain has washed the evening blue.
How the world glows!I look up piously,
My hands deep in my trouser pockets.
If the morning drives me home with screams and stones,
Half dead, stripped of my skin,
Yet I'm ready for the night!I shall soon be happy!
Street lamps blaze.Kitchen maids screech!
