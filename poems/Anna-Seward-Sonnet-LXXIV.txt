 [1]In sultry noon when youthful MILTON lay,
Supinely stretch'd beneath the poplar shade,
Lur'd by his Form, a fair Italian Maid
Steals from her loitering chariot, to survey
 The slumbering charms, that all her soul betray.
Then, as coy fears th' admiring gaze upbraid,
Starts; - and these lines, with hurried pen pourtray'd,
Slides in his half-clos'd hand; - and speeds away. - 
 "Ye eyes, ye human stars! - if, thus conceal'd
By Sleep's soft veil, ye agitate my heart,
Ah! what had been its conflict if reveal'd
 Your rays had shone!" - Bright Nymph, thy strains impart
Hopes, that impel the graceful Bard to rove,
Seeking thro' Tuscan Vales his visionary Love.

1: This romantic circumstance of our great Poet's juvenility was inserted, as a well known fact, in one of the General Evening Posts in the Spring 1789, and it was there supposed to have formed the first impulse of his Italian journey.
