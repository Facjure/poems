 There, from its entrance, lost in matted vines,
 Where in the valley foams a water-fall,
 Is glimpsed a ruined mill's remaining wall;
 Here, by the road, the oxeye daisy mines
 Hot brass and bronze; the trumpet-trailer shines
 Red as the plumage of the cardinal.
 Faint from the forest comes the rain-crow's call
 Where dusty Summer dreams among the pines.
 This is the spot where Spring writes wildflower verses
 In primrose pink, while, drowsing o'er his reins,
 The ploughman, all unnoticing, plods along:
 And where the Autumn opens weedy purses
 Of sleepy silver, while the corn-heaped wains
 Rumble the bridge like some deep throat of song.
