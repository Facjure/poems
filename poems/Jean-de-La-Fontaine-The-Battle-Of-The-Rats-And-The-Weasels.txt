title: The Battle Of The Rats And The Weasels.

[1]

 The weasels live, no more than cats,
 On terms of friendship with the rats;
 And, were it not that these
 Through doors contrive to squeeze
 Too narrow for their foes,
 The animals long-snouted
 Would long ago have routed,
 And from the planet scouted
 Their race, as I suppose.

 One year it did betide,
 When they were multiplied,
 An army took the field
 Of rats, with spear and shield,
 Whose crowded ranks led on
 A king named Ratapon.
 The weasels, too, their banner
 Unfurl'd in warlike manner.
 As Fame her trumpet sounds,
 The victory balanced well;
 Enrich'd were fallow grounds
 Where slaughter'd legions fell;
 But by said trollop's tattle,
 The loss of life in battle
 Thinn'd most the rattish race
 In almost every place;
 And finally their rout
 Was total, spite of stout
 Artarpax and Psicarpax,
 And valiant Meridarpax,[2]
 Who, cover'd o'er with dust,
 Long time sustain'd their host
 Down sinking on the plain.
 Their efforts were in vain;
 Fate ruled that final hour,
 (Inexorable power!)
 And so the captains fled
 As well as those they led;
 The princes perish'd all.
 The undistinguish'd small
 In certain holes found shelter,
 In crowding, helter-skelter;
 But the nobility
 Could not go in so free,
 Who proudly had assumed
 Each one a helmet plumed;
 We know not, truly, whether
 For honour's sake the feather,
 Or foes to strike with terror;
 But, truly, 'twas their error.
 Nor hole, nor crack, nor crevice
 Will let their head-gear in;
 While meaner rats in bevies
 An easy passage win; - 
 So that the shafts of fate
 Do chiefly hit the great.

 A feather in the cap
 Is oft a great mishap.
 An equipage too grand
 Comes often to a stand
 Within a narrow place.
 The small, whate'er the case,
 With ease slip through a strait,
 Where larger folks must wait.
