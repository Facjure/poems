When I walked roseless tracks and wide,
Ere dawned your date for meeting me,
O why did you not cry Halloo
Across the stretch between, and say:

"We move, while years as yet divide,
On closing lines which - though it be
You know me not nor I know you -
Will intersect and join some day!"

 Then well I had borne
 Each scraping thorn;
 But the winters froze,
 And grew no rose;
 No bridge bestrode
 The gap at all;
 No shape you showed,
 And I heard no call!
