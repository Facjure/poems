 To-day within a grog-shop near
 I saw a newly captured linnet,
 Who beat against his cage in fear,
 And fell exhausted every minute;
 And when I asked the fellow there
 If he to sell the bird were willing,
 He told me with a careless air
 That I could have it for a shilling.

 And so I bought it, cage and all
 (Although I went without my dinner),
 And where some trees were fairly tall
 And houses shrank and smoke was thinner,
 The tiny door I open threw,
 As down upon the grass I sank me:
 Poor little chap! How quick he flew . . .
 He didn't even wait to thank me.

 Life's like a cage; we beat the bars,
 We bruise our breasts, we struggle vainly;
 Up to the glory of the stars
 We strain with flutterings ungainly.
 And then - God opens wide the door;
 Our wondrous wings are arched for flying;
 We poise, we part, we sing, we soar . . .
 Light, freedom, love. . . . Fools call it - Dying.
