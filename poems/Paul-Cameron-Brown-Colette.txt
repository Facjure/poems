The waitress mainlines
the cup under the saucer
balancing it on the
waistband of her arm
much as a junkie
might tie a tourniquet.

Wiping the glass edge
of the table
clear of croissant crumbs
&amp; watching the barely dry
reflection of her own
image going thru the emotions.
the California chic
pothouse &amp; gardenia
bloom effect of
her work is enough
to leave a dirty smear.
