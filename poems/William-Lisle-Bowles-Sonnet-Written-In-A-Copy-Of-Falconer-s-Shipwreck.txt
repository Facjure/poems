 What pale and bleeding youth, whilst the fell blast
 Howls o'er the wreck, and fainter sinks the cry
 Of struggling wretches ere, o'erwhelmed, they die,
 Yet floats upborne upon the driving mast!
 O poor Arion! has thy sweetest strain,
 That charmed old ocean's wildest solitude,
 At this dread hour his waves' dark might subdued!
 Let sea-maids thy reclining head sustain,
 And wipe the blood and briny drops that soil
 Thy features; give once more the wreathed shell
 To ring with melody! Ah, fruitless toil!
 O'er thy devoted head the tempests swell,
 More loud relentless ocean claims his spoil:
 Peace! and may weeping sea-maids sing thy knell!
