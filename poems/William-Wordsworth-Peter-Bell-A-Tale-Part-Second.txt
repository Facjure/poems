 PART SECOND

 We left our Hero in a trance,
 Beneath the alders, near the river;
 The Ass is by the river-side,
 And, where the feeble breezes glide,
 Upon the stream the moonbeams quiver.

 A happy respite! but at length
 He feels the glimmering of the moon;
 Wakes with glazed eve. and feebly signing 
 To sink, perhaps, where he is lying,
 Into a second swoon! 

 He lifts his head, he sees his staff;
 He touches 'tis to him a treasure!
 Faint recollection seems to tell
 That he is yet where mortals dwell 
 A thought received with languid pleasure!

 His head upon his elbow propped,
 Becoming less and less perplexed,
 Sky-ward he looks to rock and wood 
 And then upon the glassy flood
 His wandering eye is fixed. 

 Thought he, that is the face of one
 In his last sleep securely bound!
 So toward the stream his head he bent,
 And downward thrust his staff, intent
 The river's depth to sound.

 'Now' like a tempest-shattered bark,
 That overwhelmed and prostrate lies,
 And in a moment to the verge
 Is lifted of a foaming surge 
 Full suddenly the Ass doth rise! 

 His staring bones all shake with joy,
 And close by Peter's side he stands:
 While Peter o'er the river bends,
 The little Ass his neck extends,
 And fondly licks his hands.

 Such life is in the Ass's eyes,
 Such life is in his limbs and ears;
 That Peter Bell, if he had been
 The veriest coward ever seen,
 Must now have thrown aside his fears. 

 The Ass looks on and to his work
 Is Peter quietly resigned;
 He touches here he touches there 
 And now among the dead man's hair
 His sapling Peter has entwined.

 He pulls and looks and pulls again;
 And he whom the poor Ass had lost,
 The man who had been four days dead,
 Head-foremost from the river's bed
 Uprises like a ghost! 

 And Peter draws him to dry land;
 And through the brain of Peter pass
 Some poignant twitches, fast and faster,
 "No doubt," quoth he, "he is the Master
 Of this poor miserable Ass!"

 The meagre Shadow that looks on 
 What would he now? what is he doing?
 His sudden fit of joy is flown, 
 He on his knees hath laid him down,
 As if he were his grief renewing; 

 But no that Peter on his back
 Must mount, he shows well as he can:
 Thought Peter then, come weal or woe,
 I'll do what he would have me do,
 In pity to this poor drowned man.

 With that resolve he boldly mounts
 Upon the pleased and thankful Ass;
 And then, without a moment's stay,
 That earnest Creature turned away
 Leaving the body on the grass. 

 Intent upon his faithful watch,
 The Beast four days and nights had past;
 A sweeter meadow ne'er was seen,
 And there the Ass four days had been,
 Nor ever once did break his fast:

 Yet firm his step, and stout his heart;
 The mead is crossed the quarry's mouth
 Is reached; but there the trusty guide
 Into a thicket turns aside,
 And deftly ambles towards the south. 

 When hark a burst of doleful sound!
 And Peter honestly might say,
 The like came never to his ears,
 Though he has been, full thirty years,
 A rover night and day!

 'Tis not a plover of the moors,
 'Tis not a bittern of the fen;
 Nor can it be a barking fox,
 Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks,
 Nor wild-cat in a woody glen! 

 The Ass is startled and stops short
 Right in the middle of the thicket;
 And Peter, wont to whistle loud
 Whether alone or in a crowd,
 Is silent as a silent cricket.

 What ails you now, my little Bess?
 Well may you tremble and look grave!
 This cry that rings along the wood,
 This cry that floats adown the flood,
 Comes from the entrance of a cave: 

 I see a blooming Wood-boy there,
 And if I had the power to say
 How sorrowful the wanderer is,
 Your heart would be as sad as his
 Till you had kissed his tears away!

 Grasping a hawthorn branch in hand,
 All bright with berries ripe and red,
 Into the cavern's mouth he peeps;
 Thence back into the moonlight creeps;
 Whom seeks he whom? the silent dead: 

 His father! Him doth he require 
 Him hath he sought with fruitless pains,
 Among the rocks, behind the trees;
 Now creeping on his hands and knees,
 Now running o'er the open plains.

 And hither is he come at last,
 When he through such a day has gone,
 By this dark cave to be distrest
 Like a poor bird her plundered nest
 Hovering around with dolorous moan! 

 Of that intense and piercing cry
 The listening Ass conjectures well;
 Wild as it is, he there can read
 Some intermingled notes that plead
 With touches irresistible.

 But Peter when he saw the Ass
 Not only stop but turn, and change
 The cherished tenor of his pace
 That lamentable cry to chase 
 It wrought in him conviction strange; 

 A faith that, for the dead man's sake
 And this poor slave who loved him well,
 Vengeance upon his head will fall,
 Some visitation worse than all
 Which ever till this night befell.

 Meanwhile the Ass to reach his home,
 Is striving stoutly as he may;
 But, while he climbs the woody hill,
 The cry grows weak and weaker still;
 And now at last it dies away. 

 So with his freight the Creature turns
 Into a gloomy grove of beech,
 Along the shade with footsteps true
 Descending slowly, till the two
 The open moonlight reach.

 And there, along the narrow dell,
 A fair smooth pathway you discern,
 A length of green and open road 
 As if it from a fountain flowed 
 Winding away between the fern. 

 The rocks that tower on either side
 Build up a wild fantastic scene;
 Temples like those among the Hindoos,
 And mosques, and spires, and abbey windows,
 And castles all with ivy green!

 And, while the Ass pursues his way,
 Along this solitary dell,
 As pensively his steps advance,
 The mosques and spires change countenance
 And look at Peter Bell! 

 That unintelligible cry
 Hath left him high in preparation, 
 Convinced that he, or soon or late,
 This very night will meet his fate 
 And so he sits in expectation!

 The strenuous Animal hath clomb
 With the green path; and now he wends
 Where, shining like the smoothest sea,
 In undisturbed immensity
 A level plain extends. 

 But whence this faintly-rustling sound
 By which the journeying pair are chased?
 A withered leaf is close behind,
 Light plaything for the sportive wind
 Upon that solitary waste.

 When Peter spied the moving thing,
 It only doubled his distress;
 "Where there is not a bush or tree,
 The very leaves they follow me 
 So huge hath been my wickedness!" 

 To a close lane they now are come,
 Where, as before, the enduring Ass
 Moves on without a moment's stop,
 Nor once turns round his head to crop
 A bramble-leaf or blade of grass.

 Between the hedges as they go,
 The white dust sleeps upon the lane;
 And Peter, ever and anon
 Back-looking, sees, upon a stone,
 Or in the dust, a crimson stain. 

 A stain as of a drop of blood
 By moonlight made more faint and wan;
 Ha! why these sinkings of despair?
 He knows not how the blood comes there 
 And Peter is a wicked man.

 At length he spies a bleeding wound,
 Where he had struck the Ass's head;
 He sees the blood, knows what it is, 
 A glimpse of sudden joy was his,
 But then it quickly fled; 

 Of him whom sudden death had seized
 He thought, of thee, O faithful Ass!
 And once again those ghastly pains,
 Shoot to and fro through heart and reins,
 And through his brain like lightning pass.
