title: The Camel And The Floating Sticks.
---

 The first who saw the humpback'd camel
 Fled off for life; the next approach'd with care;
 The third with tyrant rope did boldly dare
 The desert wanderer to trammel.
 Such is the power of use to change
 The face of objects new and strange;
 Which grow, by looking at, so tame,
 They do not even seem the same.
 And since this theme is up for our attention,
 A certain watchman I will mention,
 Who, seeing something far
 Away upon the ocean,
 Could not but speak his notion
 That 'twas a ship of war.
 Some minutes more had past, - 
 A bomb-ketch 'twas without a sail,
 And then a boat, and then a bale,
 And floating sticks of wood at last!

 Full many things on earth, I wot,
 Will claim this tale, - and well they may;
 They're something dreadful far away,
 But near at hand - they're not.
