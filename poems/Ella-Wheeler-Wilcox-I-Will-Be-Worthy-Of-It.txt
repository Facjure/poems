title: I Will Be Worthy Of It.
---

 I may not reach the heights I seek,
 My untried strength may fail me,
 Or, half-way up the mountain peak,
 Fierce tempests may assail me.
 But though that place I never gain,
 Herein lies comfort for my pain - 
I will be worthy of it.

 I may not triumph in success,
 Despite my earnest labor;
 I may not grasp results that bless
 The efforts of my neighbor;
 But though my goal I never see,
 This thought shall always dwell with me - 
I will be worthy of it.

 The golden glory of Love's light
 May never fall on my way;
 My path may always lead through night,
 Like some deserted by-way;
 But though life's dearest joy I miss
 There lies a nameless strength in this - 
I will be worthy of it.
