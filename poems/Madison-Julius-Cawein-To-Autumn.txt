I oft have net thee, Autumn, wandering
 Beside a misty stream, thy locks flung wild;
Thy cheeks a hectic flush more fair than Spring,
 As if on thee the scarlet copse had smiled.
Or thee I've seen a twisted oak beneath,
 Thy gentle eyes with foolish weeping dim,
Beneath a faded oak from whose tinged leaves
Thou woundedst drowsy wreaths, while the soft breath
 Of Morn did kiss thy locks and make them swim
Far out behind, brown as the rustling sheaves.

Oft have I thee upon a hillock seen,
 Dream-visaged, all agaze at glimpses faint
Of glimmering woods that glanced the hills between
 With Indian faces from thy airy paint.
Or I have met thee 'twixt two dappled hills
 Within a dingled valley nigh a fall,
Clasped in thy tinted hand a ruddy flower,
And lowly stooping where the leaf-dammed rills
 Went babbling low thro' wildwood's arrased hall,
Where burned the beech and maples glared their power.

Oft have I seen thee in a ruined mill,
 Where basked the crimson creeper serpentine;
Where fallen leaves did stir and rustle chill,
 And saw thee rest beneath a wild grape-vine.
While Echo, sad amid his deep-voiced mountains - 
 More sad than erst - did raise a dreamy speech
And call thee to his youthful, amorous arms,
Where splashed the murmuring forest's limpid fountains;
 And tho' his words thy pink-shell ears did reach,
Thou wouldst not heed or guile him with thy charms.

Once saw thee in a hollow girt with trees,
 A-dream amid the harvest's tawny grain;
Thy plushy cheek faint flushing in the breeze,
 In thy deep eyes a drowsy sky's blue stain.
And where within the woodland's twilight path
 The cloud-winged skies did peep all speechless down,
And stirred the gaudy leaves with fragrant breath,
I've seen thee walk, nor fear the Winter's wrath;
 There drop asleep clad in thy gipsy gown,
While Echo bending o'er dropp'd tears upon thy wreath.
