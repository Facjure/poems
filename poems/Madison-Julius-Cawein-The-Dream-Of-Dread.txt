I have lain for an hour or twain
 Awake, and the tempest is beating
On the roof, and the sleet on the pane,
 And the winds are three enemies meeting;
And I listen and hear it again,
 My name, in the silence, repeating.

Then dumbness of death that must slay,
 Till the midnight is burst like a bubble;
And out of the darkness a ray
 'T is she! the all beautiful double;
With a face like the breaking of day,
 Eyes dark with the magic of trouble.

I move not; she lies with her lips
 At mine; and I feel she is drawing
My life from my heart to their tips,
 My heart where the horror is gnawing;
My life in a thousand slow sips,
 My flesh with her sorcery awing.

She binds me with merciless eyes;
 She drinks of my blood, and I hear it
Drain up with a shudder and rise
 To the lips, like the serpent's, that steer it
And she lies and she laughs as she lies,
 Saying, "Lo, thy affinitized spirit!"

Then I hear, as if torturing swords
 Had shivered and torments had grated
Hoarse iron deep under; and words
 As of sins that howled out and awaited
A fiend who lashed into their hords,
 And a demon who lacerated.

And I shriek and lie clammy and stark,
 As the curse of a devil mounts higher,
Up, out of damnation and dark,
 Up, a hobble of hoofs that is dire;
I feel that his mouth is a spark,
 His features, of filth and of fire.

"To thy body's corruption, thy grave!
 Thy hell! from which thou hast stolen!"
And a blackness rolls down like a wave
 With a clamor of tongues that are swollen
And I feel that my flesh is the slave
 Of a vampire, diakka, eidolon?
