When I was but thirteen or so
 I went into a golden land,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi
 Took me by the hand.

My father died, my brother too,
 They passed like fleeting dreams,
I stood where Popocatapetl
 In the sunlight gleams.

I dimly heard the master's voice
 And boys far-off at play,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi
 Had stolen me away.

I walked in a great golden dream
 To and fro from school -
Shining Popocatapetl
 The dusty streets did rule.

I walked home with a gold dark boy
 And never a word I'd say,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi
 Had taken my speech away:

I gazed entranced upon his face
 Fairer than any flower -
O shining Popocatapetl
 It was thy magic hour:

The houses, people, traffic seemed
 Thin fading dreams by day,
Chimborazo, Cotopaxi
 They had stolen my soul away!
