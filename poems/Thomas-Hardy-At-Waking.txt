 When night was lifting,
And dawn had crept under its shade,
 Amid cold clouds drifting
Dead-white as a corpse outlaid,
 With a sudden scare
 I seemed to behold
 My Love in bare
 Hard lines unfold.

 Yea, in a moment,
An insight that would not die
 Killed her old endowment
Of charm that had capped all nigh,
 Which vanished to none
 Like the gilt of a cloud,
 And showed her but one
 Of the common crowd.

 She seemed but a sample
Of earth's poor average kind,
 Lit up by no ample
Enrichments of mien or mind.
 I covered my eyes
 As to cover the thought,
 And unrecognize
 What the morn had taught.

 O vision appalling
When the one believed-in thing
 Is seen falling, falling,
With all to which hope can cling.
 Off: it is not true;
 For it cannot be
 That the prize I drew
 Is a blank to me!

WEYMOUTH, 1869.
