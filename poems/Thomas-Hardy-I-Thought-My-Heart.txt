title: I Thought, My Heart
---

I thought, my Heart, that you had healed
Of those sore smartings of the past,
And that the summers had oversealed
 All mark of them at last.
But closely scanning in the night
I saw them standing crimson-bright
 Just as she made them:
 Nothing could fade them;
 Yea, I can swear
 That there they were -
 They still were there!

Then the Vision of her who cut them came,
And looking over my shoulder said,
"I am sure you deal me all the blame
 For those sharp smarts and red;
But meet me, dearest, to-morrow night,
In the churchyard at the moon's half-height,
 And so strange a kiss
 Shall be mine, I wis,
 That you'll cease to know
 If the wounds you show
 Be there or no!"
