 "Build me a house," said the Master,
 "But not on the shifting sand,
 Mid the wreck and roar of tempests,
 A house that will firmly stand.

 "I will bring thee windows of agates,
 And gates of carbuncles bright,
 And thy fairest courts and portals
 Shall be filled with love and light.

 "Thou shalt build with fadeless rubies,
 All fashioned around the throne,
 A house that shall last forever,
 With Christ as the cornerstone.
