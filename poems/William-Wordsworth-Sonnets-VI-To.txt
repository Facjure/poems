"Miss not the occasion: by the forelock take
That subtile Power, the never-halting Time,
Lest a mere moment's putting-off should make
Mischance almost as heavy as a crime."



 "Wait, prithee, wait!" this answer Lesbia threw
 Forth to her Dove, and took no further heed;
 Her eye was busy, while her fingers flew
 Across the harp, with soul-engrossing speed;
 But from that bondage when her thoughts were freed
 She rose, and toward the close-shut casement drew,
 Whence the poor unregarded Favourite, true
 To old affections, had been heard to plead
 With flapping wing for entrance. What a shriek!
 Forced from that voice so lately tuned to a strain
 Of harmony! a shriek of terror, pain,
 And self-reproach! for, from aloft, a Kite
 Pounced, and the Dove, which from its ruthless beak
 She could not rescue, perished in her sight!
