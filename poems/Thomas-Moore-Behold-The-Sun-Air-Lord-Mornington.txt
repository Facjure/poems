title: Behold The Sun. (Air.--Lord Mornington.)
---

Behold the Sun, how bright
 From yonder East he springs,
As if the soul of life and light
 Were breathing from his wings.

So bright the Gospel broke
 Upon the souls of men;
So fresh the dreaming world awoke
 In Truth's full radiance then.

Before yon Sun arose,
 Stars clustered thro' the sky--
But oh how dim, how pale were those,
 To His one burning eye!

So Truth lent many a ray,
To bless the Pagan's night--
But, Lord, how weak, how cold were they
To Thy One glorious Light!
