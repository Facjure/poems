title: Prayer To Persephone
---

 Be to her, Persephone,
 All the things I might not be;
 Take her head upon your knee.
 She that was so proud and wild,
 Flippant, arrogant and free,
 She that had no need of me,
 Is a little lonely child
 Lost in Hell,--Persephone,
 Take her head upon your knee;
 Say to her, "My dear, my dear,
 It is not so dreadful here."




CHORUS

 Give away her gowns,
 Give away her shoes;
 She has no more use
 For her fragrant gowns;
 Take them all down,
 Blue, green, blue,
 Lilac, pink, blue,
 From their padded hangers;
 She will dance no more
 In her narrow shoes;
 Sweep her narrow shoes
 From the closet floor.
