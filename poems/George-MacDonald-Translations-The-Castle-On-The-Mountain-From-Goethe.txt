Up there, upon yonder mountain,
 Stands a castle old, in the gorse,
Where once, behind doors and portals,
 Lurking lay knight and horse.

Burnt are the doors and the portals;
 All round it is very still;
Its old walls, tumbled in ruins,
 I scramble about at my will.

Close hereby lay a cellar
 Full of wine that was old and rare;
But the cheery maid with the pitchers
 No more comes down the stair;

No more in the hall, sedately
 Sets the beaker before the guest;
No more at the festival stately,
 The flagon fills for the priest;

No more to the page so thirsty
 Gives a draught in the corridor;
And receives for the hurried favour
 The hurried thanks no more.

For every rafter and ceiling
 Long ago were to ashes burned,
And stair and passage and chapel
 To rubbish and ruin turned.

Yet when, with flask and cittern,
 On a day in the summer's prime,
Up to the rocky summit
 I watched my darling climb--

Out came the old joy reviving
 On the face of the ancient rest,
And on went the old life driving,
 In its lordliness and zest;

It seemed as for strangers distinguished
 Their state-rooms they did prepare,
And out of that brave time, shadowy
 Came stepping a youthful pair.

And the worthy priest in his chapel
 Stood already in priestly dress,
And asked--Will you two take one another?
 And smiling we answered--Yes;

And the hymns with deep pulsation
 Stirred every heart at once;
And instead of the congregation
 The echo yelled response.

And when, in the gathered evening,
 Profound the stillness grew,
And the red-glowing sun at the broken
 Gable came peering through,

Then damsel and page, in his rays, are
 Grandees of the olden prime;
She tastes of his cup at her leisure,
 And he to thank her takes time.
