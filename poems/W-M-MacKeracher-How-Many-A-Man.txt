title: How Many A Man!
---

How many a man of those I see around
 Has cherished fair ideals in his youth,
And heard the spirit's call, and stood spellbound
 Before the shrine of Beauty or of Truth,
And lived to see his fair ideals fade,
 And feel a numbness creep upon his soul,
And sadly know himself no longer swayed
 By rigorous Truth or Beauty's sweet control!

For some, alas! life's thread is almost spun;
 Few, few and poor, the fibres that remain;
But yet, while life lasts, something may be done
 To make the heavenly vision not in vain;
Yet, even yet, some triumph may be won,
 Yea, loss itself be turned to precious gain.
