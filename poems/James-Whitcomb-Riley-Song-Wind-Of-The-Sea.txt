[A.T.]


 Wind of the Sea, come fill my sail - 
 Lend me the breath of a freshening gale
And bear my port-worn ship away!
 For O the greed of the tedious town - 
 The shutters up and the shutters down!
Wind of the Sea, sweep over the bay
 And bear me away! - away!

 Whither you bear me, Wind of the Sea,
 Matters never the least to me:
Give me your fogs, with the sails adrip,
 Or the weltering path thro' the starless night - 
 On, somewhere, is a new daylight
And the cheery glint of another ship
 As its colors dip and dip!



 Wind of the Sea, sweep over the bay
And bear me away! - away!
