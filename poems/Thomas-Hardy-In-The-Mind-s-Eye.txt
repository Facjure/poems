That was once her casement,
 And the taper nigh,
Shining from within there,
 Beckoned, "Here am I!"

Now, as then, I see her
 Moving at the pane;
Ah; 'tis but her phantom
 Borne within my brain! -

Foremost in my vision
 Everywhere goes she;
Change dissolves the landscapes,
 She abides with me.

Shape so sweet and shy, Dear,
 Who can say thee nay?
Never once do I, Dear,
 Wish thy ghost away.
