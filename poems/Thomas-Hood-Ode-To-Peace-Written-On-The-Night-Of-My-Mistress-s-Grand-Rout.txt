title: Ode To Peace. - Written On The Night Of My Mistress's Grand Rout.
---

Oh Peace, oh come with me and dwell - 
But stop, for there's the bell.
Oh Peace! for thee I go and sit in churches
On Wednesday, when there's very few
 In loft or pew - 
Another ring, the tarts are come from Birch's.
Oh Peace! for thee I have avoided marriage - 
Hush! there's a carriage.
Oh Peace! thou art the best of earthly goods - 
The five Miss Woods!
Oh Peace! thou art the goddess I adore - 
There come some more.
Oh Peace! thou child of solitude and quiet - 
That's Lord Dunn's footman, for he loves a riot!

 Oh Peace!
Knocks will not cease.
Oh Peace! thou wert for human comfort plann'd - 
That's Weippert's band.
Oh Peace! how glad I welcome thy approaches - 
I hear the sound of coaches.
Oh Peace! oh Peace! another carriage stops - 
It's early for the Blenkinsops.

Oh Peace! with thee I love to wander,
But wait till I have showed up Lady Squander,
And now I've seen her up the stair,
Oh Peace! - but here comes Captain Hare.
Oh Peace! thou art the slumber of the mind,
Untroubled, calm and quiet, and unbroken, - 
If that is Alderman Guzzle from Portsoken,
Alderman Gobble won't be far behind.
Oh Peace! serene in worldly shyness, - 
Make way there for his Serene Highness!

Oh Peace! if you do not disdain
To dwell amongst the menial train,
I have a silent place and lone,
That you and I may call our own;
Where tumult never makes an entry - 
Susan! what business have you in my pantry?

Oh Peace! but there is Major Monk,
At variance with his wife - Oh Peace!
And that great German, Vander Trunk,
And that great talker, Miss Apreece;
Oh Peace! so dear to poet's quills - 
Oh Peace! our greatest renovator;
I wonder where I put my waiter - 
Oh Peace! but here my Ode I'll cease,
I have no peace to write of Peace!
