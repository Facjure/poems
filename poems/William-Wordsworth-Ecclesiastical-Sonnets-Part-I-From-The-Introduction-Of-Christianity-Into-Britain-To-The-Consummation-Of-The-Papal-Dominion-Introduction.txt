Part I. From the introduction of Christianity into Britain, to the consummation of the papal dominion

"a verse may catch a wandering soul, that flies
profounder tracts, and by a blest surprise
convert delight into a sacrifice."


I. Introduction



 I, who accompanied with faithful pace
 Cerulean Duddon from his cloud-fed spring,
 And loved with spirit ruled by his to sing
 Of mountain quiet and boon nature's grace;
 I, who essayed the nobler Stream to trace
 Of Liberty, and smote the plausive string
 Till the checked torrent, proudly triumphing,
 Won for herself a lasting resting-place;
 Now seek upon the heights of Time the source
 Of a Holy River, on whose banks are found
 Sweet pastoral flowers, and laurels that have crowned
 Full oft the unworthy brow of lawless force;
 And, for delight of him who tracks its course,
 Immortal amaranth and palms abound.
