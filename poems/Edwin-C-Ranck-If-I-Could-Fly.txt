title: If I Could Fly.

(What the Little Boy Thought.)


 If I had wings just like a bird
Do you know what I'd do?
 I'd fly way up into the sky
An' holler down at you.

 I'd fly along the Milky Way
Feelin' fine and chipper,
 An' then I'd drink some buttermilk
Fresh from out the Dipper.

 I'd skim along through fleecy clouds,
An' see the great, Big Bear
 An' ask him how he liked to live
So high up in the air.

 Wouldn't it be dandy
To fly just when you please,
 An' go an' ask the Dog-star
If he worried much with fleas?

 I'd do all kinds of other things
If I could only fly,
 But I am just a little boy
An' so I dassn't try.
