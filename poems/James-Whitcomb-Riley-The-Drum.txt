 O the drum!
 There is some
 Intonation in thy grum
 Monotony of utterance that strikes the spirit dumb,
 As we hear
 Through the clear
 And unclouded atmosphere,
 Thy palpitating syllables roll in upon the car!

 There's a part
 Of the art
 Of thy music-throbbing heart
 That thrills a something in us that awakens with a start,
 And in rhyme
 With the chime
 And exactitude of time,
 Goes marching on to glory to thy melody sublime.

 And the guest
 Of the breast
 That thy rolling robs of rest
 Is a patriotic spirit as a Continental dressed;
 And he looms
 From the glooms
 Of a century of tombs,
 And the blood he spilled at Lexington in living beauty blooms.

 And his eyes
 Wear the guise
 Of a purpose pure and wise,
 As the love of them is lifted to a something in the skies
 That is bright
 Red and white,
 With a blur of starry light,
 As it laughs in silken ripples to the breezes day and night.

 There are deep
 Hushes creep
 O'er the pulses as they leap,
 As thy tumult, fainter growing, on the silence falls asleep,
 While the prayer
 Rising there
 Wills the sea and earth and air
 As a heritage to Freedom's sons and daughters everywhere.

 Then, with sound
 As profound
 As the thunderings resound,
 Come thy wild reverberations in a throe that shakes the ground,
 And a cry
 Flung on high,
 Like the flag it flutters by,
 Wings rapturously upward till it nestles in the sky.

 O the drum!
 There is some
 Intonation in thy grum
 Monotony of utterance that strikes the spirit dumb,
 As we hear
 Through the clear
 And unclouded atmosphere,
 Thy palpitating syllables roll in upon the ear!
