The moon in the East is glowing;
 I sit by the moaning sea;
The mists down the sea are blowing,
 Down the sea all dewily.

The sands at my feet are shaking,
 The stars in the sky are wan;
The mists for the shore are making,
 With a glimmer drifting on.

From the mist comes a song, sweet wailing
 In the voice of a love-lorn maid,
And I hear her gown soft trailing
 As she doth lightly wade.

The night hangs pale above me
 Upon her starry throne,
And I know the maid doth love me
 Who maketh such sweet moan.

From out the mist comes tripping
 A Mermaiden full fair,
Across the white sea skipping
 With locks of tawny hair.

Her locks with sea-ooze dripping
 She wrings with a snowy hand;
Her dress is thinly clipping
 Two breasts which perfect stand.

Oh, she was fair as the heaven
 On an autumnal eve,
And my love to her was given
 When I saw how she did grieve.

Amort o'er the sea came speeding
 This sea sprite samite-clad,
And my heart for love was bleeding,
 But its beating I forbade.

On the strand where the sand was rocking
 She stood and sang an air,
And the winds in her hair kept locking
 Their fingers cool and bare.

Soft in her arms did she fold me,
 While sweet and low she moaned;
Her love and her grief she told me,
 And the ocean sighed and groaned.

But I stilled my heart's wild beating,
 For I knew her love was dim;
Full coldly received her greeting,
 Tho' my life burnt in each limb.

In my ear right sweet she was sighing
 With the voice of the pink-veined shells;
Her arms 'round my neck kept tying,
 And gazed in mine eyes' deep wells.

With her kisses cold did she woo me,
 But I dimmed my heart's wild beat;
With the stars of her eyes did she sue me,
 But their passion did mine defeat.

With the cloud of her sea-dipped tresses
 She veiled her beautiful face; - 
And oh! how I longed for her kisses
 And sighed for her soft embrace!

But out in the mist she went wailing
 When the dawn besilvered the night,
With her robes of samite trailing
 In the foam-flowers sad and white.

Like a spirit grieved went moaning
 In a twilight over the sea,
And it seemed the night was groaning,
 And my heart beat wild in me.

But I hushed my heart's fierce beating,
 For a Mermaid false was she;
Yet I sighed at her faintly fleeting
 Across the dim, dark sea.

The moon all withered is glowing,
 The mist and she are gone;
My heart to ice is growing,
 And I sob at the coming dawn.
