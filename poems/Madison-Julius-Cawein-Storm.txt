I looked into the night and saw
GOD writing with tumultuous flame
Upon the thunder's front of awe, - 
As on sonorous brass, - the Law,
Terrific, of HIS judgement name.

Weary of all life's best and worst,
With hands of hate, I - who had pled,
I, who had prayed for death at first
And had not died - now stood and cursed
GOD, yet he would not strike me dead.
