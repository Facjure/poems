title: Duty's Path
---

Out from the harbour of youth's bay
 There leads the path of pleasure;
With eager steps we walk that way
 To brim joy's largest measure.
But when with morn's departing beam
 Goes youth's last precious minute,
We sigh "'Twas but a fevered dream -
 There's nothing in it."

Then on our vision dawns afar
 The goal of glory, gleaming
Like some great radiant solar star,
 And sets us longing, dreaming.
Forgetting all things left behind,
 We strain each nerve to win it,
But when 'tis ours -alas! we find
 There's nothing in it.

We turn our sad, reluctant gaze
 Upon the path of duty;
Its barren, uninviting ways
 Are void of bloom and beauty.
Yet in that road, though dark and cold,
 It seems as we begin it,
As we press on -lo! we behold
 There's Heaven in it.
