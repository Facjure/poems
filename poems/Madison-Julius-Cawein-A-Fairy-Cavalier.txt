By a mushroom in the moon,
 White as bud from budded berry,
Silver buckles on my shoon, - 
 Ho! the moon shines merry.

Here I sit and drink my grog, - 
 Stocks and tunic ouphen yellow,
Skinned from belly of a frog, - 
 Quite a fine, fierce fellow.

My good cloak a bat's wing gave,
 And a beetle's wings my bonnet,
And a moth's head grew the brave,
 Gallant feather on it.

Faith! I have rich jewels rare,
 Rings and carcanets all studded
Thick with spiders' eyes, that glare
 Like great rubies blooded.

And I swear, sirs, by my blade,
 "Sirrah, a good stabbing hanger!" - 
From a hornet's stinger made, - 
 When I am in anger.

Fill the lichen pottles up!
 Honey pressed from hearts of roses;
Cheek by jowl, up with each cup
 Till we hide our noses.

Good, sirs! - marry! - 'tis the cock!
 Hey, away! the moon's lost fire!
Ho! the cock our dial and clock - 
 Hide we 'neath this brier.
