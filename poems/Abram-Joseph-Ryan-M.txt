When I am dead, and all will soon forget
 My words, and face, and ways --
I, somehow, think I'll walk beside thee yet
 Adown thy after days.

I die first, and you will see my grave;
 But child! you must not cry;
For my dead hand will brightest blessings wave
 O'er you from yonder sky.

You must not weep; I believe I'd hear your tears
 Tho' sleeping in a tomb:
My rest would not be rest, if in your years
 There floated clouds of gloom.

For -- from the first -- your soul was dear to mine,
 And dearer it became,
Until my soul, in every prayer, would twine
 Thy name -- my child! thy name.

You came to me in girlhood pure and fair,
 And in your soul -- and face --
I saw a likeness to another there
 In every trace and grace.

You came to me in girlhood -- and you brought
 An image back to me;
No matter what -- or whose -- I often sought
 Another's soul in thee.

Didst ever mark how, sometimes, I became --
 Gentle though I be --
Gentler than ever when I called thy name,
 Gentlest to thee?

You came to me in girlhood; as your guide
 I watched your spirit's ways;
We walked God's holy valleys side by side,
 And so went on the days.

And so went on the years -- 'tis five and more;
 Your soul is fairer now;
A light as of a sunset on a shore
 Is falling on my brow --

Is falling, soon to fade; when I am dead
 Think this, my child, of me:
I never said -- I never could have said --
 Ungentle words to thee.

I treated you as I would treat a flower,
 I watched you with such care;
And from my lips God heard in many an hour
 Your name in many a prayer.

I watched the flower's growth; so fair it grew,
 On not a leaf a stain;
Your soul to purest thoughts so sweetly true;
 I did not watch in vain.

I guide you still -- in my steps you tread still;
 Towards God these ways are set;
'Twill soon be over: child! when I am dead
 I'll watch and guide you yet.

'Tis better far that I should go before,
 And you awhile should stay;
But I will wait upon the golden shore
 To meet my child some day.

When I am dead; in some lone after time,
 If crosses come to thee,
You'll think -- remembering this simple rhyme --
 "He holds a crown for me."

I guide you here -- I go before you there;
 But here or there -- I know --
Whether the roses, or the thorny crown you wear
 I'll watch where'er you go,

And wait until you come; when I am dead
 Think, sometimes, child, of this:
You must not weep -- follow where I led,
 I wait for you in bliss.
