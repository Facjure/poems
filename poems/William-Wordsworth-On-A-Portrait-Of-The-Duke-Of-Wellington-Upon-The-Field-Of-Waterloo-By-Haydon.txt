title: On A Portrait Of The Duke Of Wellington Upon The Field Of Waterloo, By Haydon
---

 By Art's bold privilege Warrior and War-horse stand
 On ground yet strewn with their last battle's wreck;
 Let the Steed glory while his Master's hand
 Lies fixed for ages on his conscious neck;
 But by the Chieftain's look, though at his side
 Hangs that day's treasured sword, how firm a check
 Is given to triumph and all human pride!
 Yon trophied Mound shrinks to a shadowy speck
 In his calm presence! Him the mighty deed
 Elates not, brought far nearer the grave's rest,
 As shows that time-worn face, for he such seed
 Has sown as yields, we trust, the fruit of fame
 In Heaven; hence no one blushes for thy name,
 Conqueror, 'mid some sad thoughts, divinely blest!
