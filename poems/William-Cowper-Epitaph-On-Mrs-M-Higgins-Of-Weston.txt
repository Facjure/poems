Laurels may flourish round the conqueror�s tomb,
But happiest they who win the world to come:
Believers have a silent field to fight,
And their exploits are veil�d from human sight.
They in some nook, where little known they dwell,
Kneel, pray in faith, and rout the hosts of hell;
Eternal triumphs crown their toils divine,
And all those triumphs, Mary, now are thine.
