title: The River Duddon - A Series Of Sonnets, 1820. - XXXII - Not Hurled Precipitous From Steep To Steep
---

 Not hurled precipitous from steep to steep;
 Lingering no more 'mid flower-enameled lands
 And blooming thickets; nor by rocky bands
 Held; but in radiant progress toward the Deep
 Where mightiest rivers into powerless sleep
 Sink, and forget heir nature, 'now' expands
 Majestic Duddon, over smooth flat sands
 Gliding in silence with unfettered sweep!
 Beneath an ampler sky a region wide
 Is opened round him: hamlets, towers, and towns,
 And blue-topped hills, behold him from afar;
 In stately mien to sovereign Thames allied
 Spreading his bosom under Kentish downs,
 With commerce freighted, or triumphant war.
