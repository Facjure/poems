title: A Woman's Honor: A Song
---

Love bade me hope, and I obeyed;
Phyllis continued still unkind:
Then you may e�en despair, he said,
In vain I strive to change her mind.

Honor�s got in, and keeps her heart,
Durst he but venture once abroad,
In my own right I�d take your part,
And show myself the mightier God.

This huffing Honor domineers
In breasts alone where he has place:
But if true generous Love apppears,
The hector dares not show his face.

Let me still languish and complain,
Be most unhumanly denied:
I have some pleasure in my pain,
She can have none with all her pride.

I fall a sacrifice to Love,
She lives a wretch for Honor�s sake;
Whose tyrant does most cruel prove,
The difference is not hard to make.

Consider real Honor then,
You�ll find hers cannot be the same;
�Tis noble confidence in men,
In women, mean, mistrustful shame.
