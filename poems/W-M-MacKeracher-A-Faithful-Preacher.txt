Let no one say of Christ's Church, "Ichabod,"
 Or deem her strength partaker of decay,
 Or think her trumpet voices fail. To-day
I saw a man who was a man of God,
His feet with gospel preparation shod,
 The Spirit's quick and mighty weapon sway;
 I heard him faithfully point out the way,
To him familiar, which the Master trod.

Intrepid, patient follower of the Lord,
 While such as thou, obedient to His call,
 Living epistles, known and read of all,
Proclaim the wonders of His sacred Word,
No sound of lamentation should be heard,
 No shade of apprehension should appal.
