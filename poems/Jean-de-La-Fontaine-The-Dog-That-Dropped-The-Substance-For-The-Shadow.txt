[1]

 This world is full of shadow-chasers,
 Most easily deceived.
 Should I enumerate these racers,
 I should not be believed.
 I send them all to Aesop's dog,
 Which, crossing water on a log,
 Espied the meat he bore, below;
 To seize its image, let it go;
 Plunged in; to reach the shore was glad,
 With neither what he hoped, nor what he'd had.
