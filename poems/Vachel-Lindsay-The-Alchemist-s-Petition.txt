title: The Alchemist's Petition
---

 Thou wilt not sentence to eternal life
 My soul that prays that it may sleep and sleep
 Like a white statue dropped into the deep,
 Covered with sand, covered with chests of gold,
 And slave-bones, tossed from many a pirate hold.

 But for this prayer thou wilt not bind in Hell
 My soul, that shook with love for Fame and Truth - 
 In such unquenched desires consumed his youth - 
 Let me turn dust, like dead leaves in the Fall,
 Or wood that lights an hour your knightly hall - 
Amen.
