title: Sweet Birds, I Come
---

The bird that now
 On bush and tree,
Near leaves so green
 Looks down to see
Flowers looking up, 
 He either sings
In ecstasy
 Or claps his wings.

Why should I slave
 For finer dress
Or ornaments;
 Will flowers smile less
For rags than silk?
 Are birds less dumb
For tramp than squire?
 Sweet birds, I come.
