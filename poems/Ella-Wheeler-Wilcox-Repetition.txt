Over and over and over
 These truths I will weave in song - 
That God's great plan needs you and me,
That will is greater than destiny,
 And that love moves the world along.

However mankind may doubt it,
 It shall listen and hear my creed - 
That God may ever be found within,
That the worship of self is the only sin,
 And the only devil is greed.

Over and over and over
 These truths I will say and sing,
That love is mightier far than hate,
That a man's own thought is a man's own fate,
 And that life is a goodly thing.
