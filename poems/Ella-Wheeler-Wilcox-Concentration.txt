The age is too diffusive.Time and Force
 Are frittered out and bring no satisfaction.
 The way seems lost to straight determined action.
 Like shooting stars that zig-zag from their course
 We wander from our orbit's pathway; spoil
The role we're fitted for, to fail in twenty.
Bring empty measures, that were shaped for plenty,
 At last as guerdon for a life of toil.
There's lack of greatness in this generation
 Because no more man centres on one thought.
 We know this truth, and yet we heed it not:
The secret of success is Concentration.
