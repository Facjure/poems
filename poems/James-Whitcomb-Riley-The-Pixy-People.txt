It was just a very
 Merry fairy dream! -
All the woods were airy
 With the gloom and gleam;
Crickets in the clover
 Clattered clear and strong,
And the bees droned over
 Their old honey-song.

In the mossy passes,
 Saucy grasshoppers
Leapt about the grasses
 And the thistle-burs;
And the whispered chuckle
 Of the katydid
Shook the honeysuckle
 Blossoms where he hid.

Through the breezy mazes
 Of the lazy June,
Drowsy with the hazes
 Of the dreamy noon,
Little Pixy people
 Winged above the walk,
Pouring from the steeple
 Of a mullein-stalk.

One - a gallant fellow -
 Evidently King, -
Wore a plume of yellow
 In a jewelled ring
On a pansy bonnet,
 Gold and white and blue,
With the dew still on it,
 And the fragrance, too.

One - a dainty lady, -
 Evidently Queen, -
Wore a gown of shady
 Moonshine and green,
With a lace of gleaming
 Starlight that sent
All the dewdrops dreaming
 Everywhere she went.


One wore a waistcoat
 Of roseleaves, out and in,
And one wore a faced-coat
 Of tiger-lily-skin;
And one wore a neat coat
 Of palest galingale;
And one a tiny street-coat,
 And one a swallow-tail.

And Ho! sang the King of them,
 And Hey! sang the Queen;
And round and round the ring of them
 Went dancing o'er the green;
And Hey! sang the Queen of them,
 And Ho! sang the King -
And all that I had seen of them
- Wasn't anything!

It was just a very
 Merry fairy dream! -
All the woods were airy
 With the gloom and gleam;
Crickets in the clover
 Clattered clear and strong,
And the bees droned over
 Their old honey-song!
