Janet, she was trim and small,
 Swift her feet could go;
Sandy, he was great and tall,
 Sandy, he was slow.

Dark the curls on Janet's heid,
 Dark her een, and true;
Sandy's hair was straicht an' reid,
 Sandy's een were blue.

Sandy had been coortin' lang,
 Sandy wasna bold,
Blushed when Janet trilled the sang,
 Sweet as it is old:

"Gin a body meet a body
 Comin' through the rye,
Gin a body kiss a body,
 Need a body cry?"

Janet's lips were reid and ripe,
 Full o' sic delichts;
Longing for them spoiled the pipe
 Sandy smoked o' nichts.

Janet laughed when he would sigh,
 Janet wasna kin'.
Spite o' a' as days went by
 Janet filled his min'.

When in kirk he sat and heard
 Sermons deep and lang,
Every fluttering bird ootside
 Seemed piping Janet's sang.

Through the psalm, and through the prayer,
 Thought went wanderin' wide - 
O what were toil, what were care,
 Wi' Janet by his side?

Janet, wi' the waist sae sma',
 Janet, dear indeed;
Sermon, psalm, and prayer, and a',
 Sandy didna heed - 

Going hame at sober pace
 Made confession - sae:
"Hearken, Lord! hide no Thy face
 Though I go astray.

"Help me juist tae do my pairt - 
 Win her if I can - 
Sae I plead wi' a' my hairt,
 Help a sinfu' mon!"

Surely faith was in that prayer.
 Ere an hour went by
Janet cam' wi' lichtsome air
 Through the fields o' rye.

Sandy, tak' ye hairt o' grace - 
 Surely 'tisna wrang - 
Here's the lass wi' saucy face,
 How runs Janet's sang?

"Gin a body meet a body
 Comin' through the rye,
Gin a body kiss a body
 Need a body cry?"
