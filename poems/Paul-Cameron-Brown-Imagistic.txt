There in the cosmos - 
white dwarfs launch a black rooftop
imagistic, clean as a pantry,
the twilight roads with ledges lean
like raw openings.

And coming upon stars
in a country woodhouse
 - cold, big as frozen pears,
each breath of light visible
thru chinks &amp; clusters
of broken ceiling wood;
hands raw &amp; nipped sawing logs - 
breath menacing the depths
on inner space, something pale
and profoundly suggestive.
