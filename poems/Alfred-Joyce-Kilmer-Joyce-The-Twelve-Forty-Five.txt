(For Edward J. Wheeler)



 Within the Jersey City shed
 The engine coughs and shakes its head,
 The smoke, a plume of red and white,
 Waves madly in the face of night.
 And now the grave incurious stars
 Gleam on the groaning hurrying cars.
 Against the kind and awful reign
 Of darkness, this our angry train,
 A noisy little rebel, pouts
 Its brief defiance, flames and shouts --
 And passes on, and leaves no trace.
 For darkness holds its ancient place,
 Serene and absolute, the king
 Unchanged, of every living thing.
 The houses lie obscure and still
 In Rutherford and Carlton Hill.
 Our lamps intensify the dark
 Of slumbering Passaic Park.
 And quiet holds the weary feet
 That daily tramp through Prospect Street.
 What though we clang and clank and roar
 Through all Passaic's streets?No door
 Will open, not an eye will see
 Who this loud vagabond may be.
 Upon my crimson cushioned seat,
 In manufactured light and heat,
 I feel unnatural and mean.
 Outside the towns are cool and clean;
 Curtained awhile from sound and sight
 They take God's gracious gift of night.
 The stars are watchful over them.
 On Clifton as on Bethlehem
 The angels, leaning down the sky,
 Shed peace and gentle dreams.And I --
 I ride, I blasphemously ride
 Through all the silent countryside.
 The engine's shriek, the headlight's glare,
 Pollute the still nocturnal air.
 The cottages of Lake View sigh
 And sleeping, frown as we pass by.
 Why, even strident Paterson
 Rests quietly as any nun.
 Her foolish warring children keep
 The grateful armistice of sleep.
 For what tremendous errand's sake
 Are we so blatantly awake?
 What precious secret is our freight?
 What king must be abroad so late?
 Perhaps Death roams the hills to-night
 And we rush forth to give him fight.
 Or else, perhaps, we speed his way
 To some remote unthinking prey.
 Perhaps a woman writhes in pain
 And listens -- listens for the train!
 The train, that like an angel sings,
 The train, with healing on its wings.
 Now "Hawthorne!" the conductor cries.
 My neighbor starts and rubs his eyes.
 He hurries yawning through the car
 And steps out where the houses are.
 This is the reason of our quest!
 Not wantonly we break the rest
 Of town and village, nor do we
 Lightly profane night's sanctity.
 What Love commands the train fulfills,
 And beautiful upon the hills
 Are these our feet of burnished steel.
 Subtly and certainly I feel
 That Glen Rock welcomes us to her
 And silent Ridgewood seems to stir
 And smile, because she knows the train
 Has brought her children back again.
 We carry people home -- and so
 God speeds us, wheresoe'er we go.
 Hohokus, Waldwick, Allendale
 Lift sleepy heads to give us hail.
 In Ramsey, Mahwah, Suffern stand
 Houses that wistfully demand
 A father -- son -- some human thing
 That this, the midnight train, may bring.
 The trains that travel in the day
 They hurry folks to work or play.
 The midnight train is slow and old
 But of it let this thing be told,
 To its high honor be it said
 It carries people home to bed.
 My cottage lamp shines white and clear.
 God bless the train that brought me here.
