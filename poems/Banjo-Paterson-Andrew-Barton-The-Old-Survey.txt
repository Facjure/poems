Our money�s all spent, to the deuce went it!
The landlord, he looks glum,
On the tap-room wall, in a very bad scrawl,
He has chalked to us a sum.
But a glass we�ll take, ere the grey dawn break,
And then saddle up and away�
Theodolite-tum, theodolite-ti, theodolite-too-ral-ay.

With a measured beat fall our horses� feet,
Galloping side by side;
When the money�s done, and we�ve had our fun,
We all are bound to ride.
O�er the far-off plain we�ll drag the chain,
And mark the settler�s way�
Theodolite-tum, theodolite-ti, theodolite-too-ral-ay.

We�ll range from the creeks to the mountain peaks,
And traverse far below;
Where foot never trod, we�ll mark with a rod
The limits of endless snow;

Each lofty crag we�ll plant with a flag,
To flash in the sun�s bright ray�
Theodolite-tum, theodolite-ti, theodolite-too-ral-ay.

Till with cash hard-earned once more returned,
At �The Beaver� bars we�ll shout;
And the very bad scrawl that�s against the wall
Ourselves shall see wiped out.
Such were the ways in the good old days!�
The days of the old survey!
Theodolite-tum, theodolite-ti, theodolite-too-ral-ay.
