 The maple strews the embers of its leaves
O'er the laggard swallows nestled 'neath the eaves;
 And the moody cricket falters in his cry - Baby-bye! -
 And the lid of night is falling o'er the sky - Baby-bye! -
The lid of night is falling o'er the sky!

 The rose is lying pallid, and the cup
 Of the frosted calla-lily folded up;
 And the breezes through the garden sob and sigh - Baby-bye! -
 O'er the sleeping blooms of summer where they lie - Baby-bye! -
O'er the sleeping blooms of summer where they lie!

 Yet, Baby - O my Baby, for your sake
 This heart of mine is ever wide awake,
 And my love may never droop a drowsy eye - Baby-bye! -
 Till your own are wet above me when I die - Baby-bye! -
Till your own are wet above me when I die.
