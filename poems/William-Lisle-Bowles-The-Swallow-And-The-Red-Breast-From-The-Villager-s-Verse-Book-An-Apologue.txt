 The swallows, at the close of day,
 When autumn shone with fainter ray,
 Around the chimney circling flew,
 Ere yet they bade a long adieu,
 To climes where soon the winter drear
 Shall close the unrejoicing year.
 Now with swift wing they skim aloof,
 Now settle on the crowded roof,
 As counsel and advice to take,
 Ere they the chilly north forsake.
 Then one, disdainful, turned his eye,
 Upon a red-breast twittering nigh,
 And thus began, with taunting scorn:
 Thou household imp, obscure, forlorn,
 Through the deep winter's dreary day,
 Here, dull and shivering, shalt thou stay;
 Whilst we, who make the world our home,
 To softer climes impatient roam,
 Where summer, still on some green isle
 Rests, with her sweet and lovely smile?
 Thus speeding, far and far away,
 We leave behind the shortening day.
 'Tis true (the red-breast answered, meek)
 No other scenes I ask, or seek;
 To every change alike resigned,
 I fear not the cold winter's wind.
 When spring returns, the circling year
 Shall find me still contented here;
 But whilst my warm affections rest
 Within the circle of my nest,
 I learn to pity those that roam,
 And love the more my humble home.
