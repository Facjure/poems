title: The Close Of The Session

The Session's over.We must say farewell
 To these east winds and to this eastern sea,
 For summer comes, with swallow and with bee,
With many a flower and many a golfing swell.

No more the horribly discordant bell
 Shall startle slumber; and all men agree
 That whatsoever other things may be
A cause of sorrow, this at least is well.

The class-room shall not open wide its doors,
 Or if it does, such opening will be vain;
The gown shall hang unused upon a nail;
South Street shall know us not; we'll wipe the Scores
 From our remembrance; as for Mutto's Lane,
Yea, even the memory of this shall fail.
