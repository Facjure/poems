Because thou hast believ�d, the wheels of life
Stand never idle, but go always round:
Not by their hands, who vex the patient ground,
Mov�d only; but by genius, in the strife
Of all its chafing torrents after thaw,
Urg�d; and to feed whose movement, spinning sand,
The feeble sons of pleasure set their hand:
And, in this vision of the general law,
Hast labour�d with the foremost, hast become
Laborious, persevering, serious, firm;
For this, thy track, across the fretful foam
Of vehement actions without scope or term,
Call�d History, keeps a splendour: due to wit,
Which saw one clue to life, and follow�d it
