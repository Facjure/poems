title: Heigh Ho, The Rain
---

The Lark that in heaven dim
 Can match a rainy hour
 With his own music's shower,
Can make me sing like him, 
 Heigh ho! The rain!

Sing, when a Nightingale
 Pours forth her own sweet soul
 To hear dread thunder roll
Into a tearful tale, 
 Heigh ho! The rain!

Sing, when a Sparrow's seen
 Trying to lie at rest
 By pressing his warm breast
To leaves so wet and green, 
 Heigh ho! The rain!
