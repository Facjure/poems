title: Rouge And Gray

So much time has passed
&amp; time is a hooligan run wild
littering the streets,
squeezing toothpaste at the wrong end
shredding clothes with a razor blade.

Time is never called into account- 
lives like Peter Pan
in a flying abode above it all
scot-free, the surly bandit.

A perilous acquisition- 
tiny pinpricks above the eye-brows
crows' feet
 -all too visible rending of
fleshy corners bulbed
to puffiness.

Red-handed,
I caught time
his knife in Youth once more
still-water decay,
brackish trouble-maker
with tint of rouge and gray.

This school-yard tough
still picking on the corner weakling.
braggadocio and upstart
spoiling for a fight
first elbow up,
each foot in a fray.
