title: Friend Or Foe?
---

There's a man I know - 
 A likeable man - 
Whom you meanly wound
 Whenever you can,
Remark with malice
 His task is done ill,
He's poor of judgment
 And weak of will.
I implore you, now,
 As that poor man's friend,
Let persecution
 Have speediest end.

Cease taunting the man
 With blunders he makes,
Cease harping alway
 On wrongs and mistakes.
Come, be his good friend - 
 Hail fellow, well met - 
His failures forgive,
 And his faults forget.
Who is the man you've
 Discouraged and blamed?
The man is yourself - 
 Are you not ashamed?

For faults of the past
 Make ample amends,
And you and yourself
 Be the best of friends.
