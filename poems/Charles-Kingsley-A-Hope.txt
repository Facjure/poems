Twin stars, aloft in ether clear,
 Around each other roll alway,
Within one common atmosphere
 Of their own mutual light and day.

And myriad happy eyes are bent
 Upon their changeless love alway;
As, strengthened by their one intent,
 They pour the flood of life and day.

So we through this world's waning night
 May, hand in hand, pursue our way;
Shed round us order, love, and light,
 And shine unto the perfect day.
