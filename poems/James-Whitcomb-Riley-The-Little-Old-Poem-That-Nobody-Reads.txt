title: The Little Old Poem That Nobody Reads
---

 The little old poem that nobody reads
Blooms in a crowded space,
 Like a ground-vine blossom, so low in the weeds
That nobody sees its face -
 Unless, perchance, the reader's eye
 Stares through a yawn, and hurries by,
 For no one wants, or loves, or heeds,
 The little old poem that nobody reads.

 The little old poem that nobody reads
Was written - where? - and when?
 Maybe a hand of goodly deeds
Thrilled as it held the pen:
 Maybe the fountain whence it came
 Was a heart brimmed o'er with tears of shame,
 And maybe its creed is the worst of creeds -
 The little old poem that nobody reads.

 But, little old poem that nobody reads,
Holding you here above
 The wound of a heart that warmly bleeds
For all that knows not love,
 I well believe if the old World knew
 As dear a friend as I find in you,
 That friend would tell it that all it needs
 Is the little old poem that nobody reads.
