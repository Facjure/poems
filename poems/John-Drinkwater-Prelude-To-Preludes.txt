title: Prelude To "Preludes"
---

Though black the night, I know upon the sky,
A little paler now, if clouds were none,
The stars would be. Husht now the thickets lie,
And now the birds are moving one by one,, 
A note, and now from bush to bush it goes, 
A prelude, now victorious light along
The west will come till every bramble glows
With wash of sunlit dew shaken in song.
Shaken in song;O heart, be ready now,
Cold in your night, be ready now to sing.
Dawn as it wakes the sleeping bird on bough
Shall summon you to instant reckoning,, 
She is your dawn, O heart,, sing, till the night
Of death shall come, the gospel of her light.
