title: River And Sea
---

We stood by the river that swept
 In its glory and grandeur away;
But never a pulse o' me leapt,
 And you wondered at me that day.

We stood by the lake as it lay
 With its dimpled face turned to the light;
Was it strange I had nothing to say
 To so fair and enchanting a sight?

I look on your tresses of gold - 
 You are fair and a thing to be loved - 
Do you think I am heartless and cold
 That I look and am wholly unmoved?

One answer, dear friend, I will make
 To the questions your eyes ask of me:
"Talk not of the river or lake
 To those who have looked on the sea"
