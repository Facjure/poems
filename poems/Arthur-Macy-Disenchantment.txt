 Time and I have fallen out;
 We, who were such steadfast friends.
 So slowly has it come about
 That none may tell when it began;
 Yet sure am I a cunning plan
 Runs through it all;
 And now, beyond recall,
 Our friendship ends,
 And ending, there remains to me
 The memory of disloyalty.

 Long years ago Time tripping came
 With promise grand,
 And sweet assurances of fame;
 And hand in hand
 Through fairy-land
 Went he and I together
 In bright and golden weather.
 Then, then I had not learned to doubt,
 For friends were gods, and faith was sure,
 And words were truth, and deeds were pure,
 Before we had our falling out;
 And life, all hope, was fair to see,
 When Time made promise sweet to me.

 When first my faithless friend grew cold
 I sought to knit a closer bond,
 But he, less fond,
 Sad days and years upon me rolled,
 Pressed me with care,
 With envy tinged the boyhood hair,
 And ploughed unwelcome furrows in
 Where none had been.
 In vain I begged with trembling lip
 For our old sweet companionship,
 And saw, 'mid prayers and tears devout,
 The presage of our falling out.

 And now I know Time has no friends,
 Nor pity lends,
 But touches all
 With heavy finger soon or late;
 And as we wait
 The Reaper's call,
 The sickle's fatal sweep,
 We strive in vain to keep
 One truth inviolate,
 One cherished fancy free from doubt.
 It was not so
 Long years ago,
 Before we had our falling out.

 If Time would come again to me,
 And once more take me by the hand
 For golden walks through fairy-land,
 I could forgive the treachery
 That stole my youth
 And what of truth
 Was mine to know;
 Nor would I more his love misdoubt;
 And I would throw
 My arms around him so,
 That he'd forgive the falling out!
