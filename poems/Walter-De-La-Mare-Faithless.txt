 The words you said grow faint;
 The lamp you lit burns dim;
 Yet, still be near your faithless friend
 To urge and counsel him.

 Still with returning feet
 To where life's shadows brood,
 With steadfast eyes made clear in death
 Haunt his vague solitude.

 So he, beguiled with earth,
 Yet with its vain things vexed,
 Keep even to his own heart unknown
 Your memory unperplexed.
