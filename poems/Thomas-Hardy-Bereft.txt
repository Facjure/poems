 In the black winter morning
No light will be struck near my eyes
While the clock in the stairway is warning
For five, when he used to rise.
 Leave the door unbarred,
 The clock unwound,
 Make my lone bed hard -
 Would 'twere underground!

 When the summer dawns clearly,
And the appletree-tops seem alight,
Who will undraw the curtain and cheerly
Call out that the morning is bright?

 When I tarry at market
No form will cross Durnover Lea
In the gathering darkness, to hark at
Grey's Bridge for the pit-pat o' me.

 When the supper crock's steaming,
And the time is the time of his tread,
I shall sit by the fire and wait dreaming
In a silence as of the dead.
 Leave the door unbarred,
 The clock unwound,
 Make my lone bed hard -
 Would 'twere underground!

1901.
