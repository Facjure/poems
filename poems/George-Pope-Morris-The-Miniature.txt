William was holding in his hand
 The likeness of his wife!
Fresh, as if touched by fairy wand,
 With beauty, grace, and life.
He almost thought it spoke:--he gazed
 Upon the bauble still,
Absorbed, delighted, and amazed,
 To view the artist's skill.

"This picture is yourself, dear Jane--
 'Tis drawn to nature true:
I've kissed it o'er and o'er again,
 It is much like you."
"And has it kissed you back, my dear?"
 "Why--no--my love," said he.
"Then, William, it is very clear
 'Tis not at all LIKE ME!"
