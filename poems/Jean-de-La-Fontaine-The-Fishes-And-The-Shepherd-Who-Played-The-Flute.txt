title: The Fishes And The Shepherd Who Played The Flute.

[1]

 Thrysis - who for his Annette dear
 Made music with his flute and voice,
 Which might have roused the dead to hear,
 And in their silent graves rejoice - 
 Sang once the livelong day,
 In the flowery month of May,
 Up and down a meadow brook,
 While Annette fish'd with line and hook.
 But ne'er a fish would bite;
 So the shepherdess's bait
 Drew not a fish to its fate,
 From morning dawn till night.
 The shepherd, who, by his charming songs,
 Had drawn savage beasts to him in throngs,
 And done with them as he pleased to,
 Thought that he could serve the fish so.
 'O citizens,' he sang, 'of this water,
 Leave your Naiad in her grot profound;
 Come and see the blue sky's lovely daughter,
 Who a thousand times more will charm you;
 Fear not that her prison will harm you,
 Though there you should chance to get bound.
 'Tis only to us men she is cruel:
 You she will treat kindly;
 A snug little pond she'll find ye,
 Clearer than a crystal jewel,
 Where you may all live and do well;
 Or, if by chance some few
 Should find their fate
 Conceal'd in the bait,
 The happier still are you;
 For envied is the death that's met
 At the hands of sweet Annette.'
 This eloquence not effecting
 The object of his wishes,
 Since it failed in collecting
 The deaf and dumb fishes, - 
 His sweet preaching wasted,
 His honey'd talk untasted,
 A net the shepherd seized, and, pouncing
 With a fell scoop at the scaly fry,
 He caught them; and now, madly flouncing,
 At the feet of his Annette they lie!

 O ye shepherds, whose sheep men are,
 To trust in reason never dare.
 The arts of eloquence sublime
 Are not within your calling;
 Your fish were caught, from oldest time,
 By dint of nets and hauling.
