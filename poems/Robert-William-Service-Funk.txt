 When your marrer bone seems 'oller,
 And you're glad you ain't no taller,
 And you're all a-shakin' like you 'ad the chills;
 When your skin creeps like a pullet's,
 And you're duckin' all the bullets,
 And you're green as gorgonzola round the gills;
 When your legs seem made of jelly,
 And you're squeamish in the belly,
 And you want to turn about and do a bunk:
 For Gawd's sake, kid, don't show it!
 Don't let your mateys know it - 
 You're just sufferin' from funk, funk, funk.

 Of course there's no denyin'
 That it ain't so easy tryin'
 To grin and grip your rifle by the butt,
 When the 'ole world rips asunder,
 And you sees yer pal go under,
 As a bunch of shrapnel sprays 'im on the nut;
 I admit it's 'ard contrivin'
 When you 'ears the shells arrivin',
 To discover you're a bloomin' bit o' spunk;
 But, my lad, you've got to do it,
 And your God will see you through it,
 For wot 'E 'ates is funk, funk, funk.

 So stand up, son; look gritty,
 And just 'um a lively ditty,
 And only be afraid to be afraid;
 Just 'old yer rifle steady,
 And 'ave yer bay'nit ready,
 For that's the way good soldier-men is made.
 And if you 'as to die,
 As it sometimes 'appens, why,
 Far better die a 'ero than a skunk;
 A-doin' of yer bit,
 And so - to 'ell with it,
 There ain't no bloomin' funk, funk, funk.
