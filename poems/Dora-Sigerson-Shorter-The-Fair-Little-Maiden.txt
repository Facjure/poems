 �There is one at the door, Wolfe O�Driscoll,
At the door, who is bidding you come!�
 �Who is he that wakes me in the darkness,
Calling when all the world�s dumb?�

 �Six horses has he to his carriage,
Six horses blacker than the night,
 And their twelve red eyes in the shadows
Twelve lamps he carries for his light;

 �And his coach is a coffin black and mouldy,
A huge black coffin open wide:
 He asks for your soul, Wolfe O�Driscoll,
Who is calling at the door outside.�

 �Who let him thro� the gates of my gardens,
Where stronger bolts have never been?�
 ��Twas the father of the fair little maiden
You drove to her grave so green.�

 �And who let him pass through the courtyard,
By loosening the bar and the chain?�
 �Oh, who but the brother of the maiden,
Who lies in the cold and the rain!�

 �Then who drew the bolts at the portal,
And into my house bade him go?�
 �She, the mother of the poor young maiden,
Who lies in her youth so low.�

 �Who stands, that he dare not enter,
The door of my chamber, between?�
 �O, the ghost of the fair little maiden,
Who lies in the churchyard green.�
