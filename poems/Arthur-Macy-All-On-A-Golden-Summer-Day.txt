title: All On A Golden Summer Day
---

 All on a golden summer day,
 As through the leaves a single ray
 Of yellow sunshine finds its way
 So bright, so bright;
 The wakened birds that blithely sing
 Seem welcoming another spring;
 While all the woods are murmuring
 So light, so light.

 All on a golden summer day,
 When to my heart a single ray
 Of tender kindness finds its way,
 So bright, so bright;
 Then comes sweet hope and bravely dares
 To break the chain that sorrow wears - 
 And all my burdens, all my cares
 Are light, so light!
