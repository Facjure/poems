title: Mystical Rose, Pray For Us!
---

O aptly named, Illustrious One!
Thou art that flower fair
That filled this vast and changeful world
With mystic perfume rare - 
Shedding on all the balmy breath
Of countless virtues high,
Rising like fragrant odours rich,
To God's far, beauteous sky.

Mystical Rose! O aptly named!
For, as 'mid brightest flowers
The lovely Rose unquestioned reigns
The Queen of Nature's bowers,
So 'mid the daughters fair of Eve
Art thou the peerless One!
The chosen handmaid of the Lord!
The Mother of His Son!

Yes, He endowed thee with all gifts
Which could thy beauty grace;
And ne'er did sin, e'en for one hour,
Thy spotless soul deface,
For from the first thou had'st the power
God's fav'ring love to win;
It was His will that thou should'st be
Conceived devoid of sin.

Oh, Mother dear, obtain for us
That we from evil flee;
Throughout this, fleeting life's career
Mayst thou our model be!
Seek we to imitate the gifts
That thy pure soul adorn - 
Sweet flower of beauty and of grace!
Fair Rose without a thorn!
