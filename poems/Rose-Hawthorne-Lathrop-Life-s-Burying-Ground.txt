My graveyard holds no once-loved human forms,
Grown hideous and forgotten, left alone,
But every agony my heart has known, - 
The new-born trusts that died, the drift of storms.

I visit every day the shadowy grove;
I bury there my outraged tender thought;
I bring the insult for the love I sought,
And my contempt, where I had tried to love.
