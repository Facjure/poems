 Last Thanksgivin'-dinner we
 Et at Granny's house, an' she

 Had - ist like she alluz does - 
 Most an' best pies ever wuz.

 Canned black burry-pie an' goose
 Burry, squshin'-full o' juice;
 An' rozburry - yes, an' plum - 
 Yes, an' churry-pie - um-yum!

 Peach an' punkin, too, you bet.
 Lawzy! I kin taste 'em yet!
 Yes, an' custard-pie, an' mince!

*****

 An' - I - ain't - et - no - pie - since!
