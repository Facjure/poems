Young Harry leapt over the stile and kissed her,
 Over the stile the stars a-winking;
He thought it was Mary, 't was Mary's sister 
 And love hath a way of thinking.

"Thy pail, sweetheart, I will take and carry." 
 Over the stile the stars hang yellow. 
"Just to the spring, my sweetheart Harry." 
 And love is a heartless fellow.

"Thou saidst me yea when the frost did shower
 Over the stile from stars a-shiver." 
"I say thee nay now the cherry-trees flower,
 And love is taker and giver."

"O false! thou art false to me, sweetheart!" 
 Over the stile the stars a-glister.
"To thee, the stars, and myself, sweetheart,
 I never was aught save Mary's sister.

"Sweet Mary's sister and thou my Harry,
 Her Harry and mine, but mine the weeping:
In a month or twain you two will marry 
 And I in my grave be sleeping."

Alone among the meadows of millet,
 Over the stile the stars pursuing,
Some tears in her pail as she stoops to fill it 
 And love hath a way of doing.
