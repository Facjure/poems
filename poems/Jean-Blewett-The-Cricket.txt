 O the gayest of musicians! O the gladdest thing on earth,
 With its piping and its chirping, is the cricket on the hearth!
 There is magic in the music that he flings us with such zest:
 "Love's the only wealth that's lasting - who cares aught for all the rest?
 Never mind though ill-luck dog you, never mind though times are hard,
 Have you not the wife and bairns?" chirps the sweet, insistent bard - 
 Chirps and chirps, until you heed him, till your heart is all aglow - 
 "Love's the only wealth that's lasting, home's a bit of heaven below."
 O the gayest of musicians! O the gladdest thing on earth,
 With his piping and his chirping, is the cricket on the hearth!
