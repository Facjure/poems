Love met a worldling on the way,
 And softly crept into his breast.
Straight Self and Greed refused to stay
 Where Love had dared to make his nest.

Love met a mourner on the road,
 And said: "I'll bear thee company."
Full soon the mourner lost his load
 Of grief, and care, and misery.

Into a grim and cheerless home
 Love forced his way through barriers tall;
Fled wretchedness, and chill, and gloom - 
 The golden sunshine flooded all.
