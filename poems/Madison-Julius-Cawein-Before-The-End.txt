 How does the Autumn in her mind conclude
 The tragic masque her frosty pencil writes,
 Broad on the pages of the days and nights,
 In burning lines of orchard, wold, and wood?
 What lonelier forms, that at the year's door stood
 At spectral wait, with wildly wasted lights
 Shall enter? and with melancholy rites
 Inaugurate their sadder sisterhood?
 Sorrow, who lifts a signal hand, and slow
 The green leaf fevers, falling ere it dies;
 Regret, whose pale lips summon, and gaunt Woe
 Wakes the wild-wind harps with sonorous sighs;
 And Sleep, who sits with poppied eyes and sees
 The earth and sky grow dream-accessories.
