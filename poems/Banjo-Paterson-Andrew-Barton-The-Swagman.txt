Kind friends, pray give attention
To this, my little song.
Some rum things I will mention,
And I�ll not detain you long.
Up and down this country
I travel, don�t you see,
I�m a swagman on the wallaby,
Oh! don�t you pity me.
I�m a swagman on the wallaby,
Oh! don�t you pity me.

At first I started shearing,
And I bought a pair of shears.
On my first sheep appearing,
Why, I cut off both its ears.
Then I nearly skinned the brute,
As clean as clean could he.
So I was kicked out of the shed,
Oh! don�t you pity me, &amp;c.

I started station loafing,
Short stages and took my ease;
So all day long till sundown
I�d camp beneath the trees.
Then I�d walk up to the station,
The manager to see.
�Boss, I�m hard up and I want a job,
Oh! don�t you pity me,� &amp;c.

Says the overseer: �Go to the hut.
In the morning I�ll tell you
If I�ve any work about
I can find for you to do.�
But at breakfast I cuts off enough
For dinner, don�t you see.
And then my name is Walker.
Oh! don�t you pity me.
I�m a swagman, &amp;c.

And now, my friends, I�ll say good-bye,
For I must go and camp.
For if the Sergeant sees me
He may take me for a tramp;
But if there�s any covey here
What�s got a cheque, d�ye see,
I�ll stop and help him smash it.
Oh! don�t you pity me.
I�m a swagman on the wallaby,
Oh! don�t you pity me.
