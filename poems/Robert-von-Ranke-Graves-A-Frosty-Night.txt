Mother

 Alice, dear, what ails you,
 Dazed and white and shaken?
 Has the chill night numbed you?
 Is it fright you have taken?

Alice


 Mother, I am very well,
 I felt never better,
 Mother, do not hold me so,
 Let me write my letter.

Mother

 Sweet, my dear, what ails you?

Alice

 No, but I am well;
 The night was cold and frosty,
 There's no more to tell.

Mother

 Ay, the night was frosty,
 Coldly gaped the moon,
 Yet the birds seemed twittering
 Through green boughs of June.

 Soft and thick the snow lay,
 Stars danced in the sky.
 Not all the lambs of May-day
 Skip so bold and high.

 Your feet were dancing, Alice,
 Seemed to dance on air,
 You looked a ghost or angel
 In the starlight there.

 Your eyes were frosted starlight,
 Your heart fire and snow.
 Who was it said, "I love you"?

Alice

 Mother, let me go!
