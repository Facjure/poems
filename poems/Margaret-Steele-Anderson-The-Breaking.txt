(The Lord God speaks to a youth.) 

Bend now thy body to the common weight! 
(But oh, that vine-clad head, those limbs of morn! 
Those proud young shoulders I myself made straight! 
How shall ye wear the yoke that must be worn?) 

Look thou, my son, what wisdom comes to thee! 
(But oh, that singing mouth, those radiant eyes! 
Those dancing feet, that I myself made free! 
How shall I sadden them to make them wise?) 

Nay then, thou shalt! Resist not, have a care! 
(Yea, I must work my plans who sovereign sit! 
Yet do not tremble so! I cannot bear
Though I am God! to see thee so submit!)
