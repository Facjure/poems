 Take, then, your paltry Christ,
Your gentleman God.
 We want the carpenter's son,
With his saw and hod.

 We want the man who loved
The poor and oppressed,
 Who hated the rich man and king
And the scribe and the priest.

 We want the Galilean
Who knew cross and rod.
 It's your "good taste" that prefers
A bastard God!
