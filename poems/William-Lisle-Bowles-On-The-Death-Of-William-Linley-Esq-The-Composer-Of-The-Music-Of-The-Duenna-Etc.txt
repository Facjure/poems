 Poor Linley! I shall miss thee sadly, now
 Thou art not in the world; for few remain
 Who loved like thee the high and holy strain
 Of harmony's immortal master.
 Thou
 Didst honour him; and none I know, who live,
 Could even a shadow, a faint image give,
 With chord and voice, of those rich harmonies,
 Which, mingled in one mighty volume, rise,
 Glorious, from earth to heaven, so to express
 Choral acclaim to Heaven's almightiness,
 As thou! Therefore, amid the world's deep roar,
 When the sweet visions of young Hope are fled,
 And many friends dispersed, and many dead,
 I grieve that I shall hear that voice no more.
