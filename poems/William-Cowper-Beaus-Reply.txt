Sir, when I flew to seize the bird
In spite of your command,
A louder voice than yours I heard,
And harder to withstand.


You cried�Forbear!�but in my breast
A mightier cried�Proceed!�
�Twas nature, Sir, whose strong behest
Impell�d me to the deed.


Yet, much as nature I respect,
I ventured once to break
(As you perhaps may recollect)
Her precept for your sake;


And when your linnet on a day,
Passing his prison door,
Had flutter�d all his strength away,
And panting press�d the floor.


Well knowing him a sacred thing,
Not destined to my tooth,
I only kiss�d his ruffled wing,
And lick�d the feathers smooth.


Let my obedience then excuse
My disobedience now,
Nor some reproof yourself refuse
From your aggrieved bow-wow:


If killing birds be such a crime
(Which I can hardly see),
What think you, Sir, of killing time
With verse address�d to me!
