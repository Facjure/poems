title: Our Lady Of The Snows
---

A nation spoke to a Nation,
A Queen sent word to a Throne:
�Daughter am I in my mother�s house,
But mistress in my own.
The gates are mine to open,
As the gates are mine to close,
And I set my house in order,�
Said our Lady of the Snows.

�Neither with laughter nor weeping,
Fear or the child�s amaze,
Soberly under the White Man�s law
My white men go their ways.
Not for the Gentiles� clamour,
Insult or threat of blows,
Bow we the knee to Baal,�
Said our Lady of the Snows.

�My speech is clean and single,
I talk of common things,
Words of the wharf and the market-place
And the ware the merchant brings:
Favour to those I favour,
But a stumbling-block to my foes.
Many there be that hate us,�
Said our Lady of the Snows.

�I called my chiefs to council
In the din of a troubled year;
For the sake of a sign ye would not see,
And a word ye would not hear.
This is our message and answer;
This is the path we chose:
For we be also a people,�
Said our Lady of the Snows.

�Carry the word to my sisters,
To the Queens of the East and the South.
I have proven faith in the Heritage
By more than the word of the mouth.
They that are wise may follow
Ere the world�s war-trumpet blows,,
But I, I am first in the battle,�
Said our Lady of the Snows.

A Nation spoke to a Nation
A Throne sent word to a Throne:
�Daughter am I in my mother�s house
But mistress in my own.
The gates are mine to open,
As the gates are mine to close,
And I abide by my Mother�s House,�
Said our Lady of the Snows.
