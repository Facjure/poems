title: Easter Morn

A truth that has long lain buried
 At Superstition's door,
I see, in the dawn uprising
 In all its strength once more.

Hidden away in the darkness,
 By Ignorance crucified,
Crushed under stones of dogmas -
 Yet lo! it has not died.

It stands in the light transfigured,
 It speaks from the heights above,
"EACH SOUL IS ITS OWN REDEEMER;
 THERE IS NO LAW BUT LOVE."

And the spirits of men are gladdened
 As they welcome this Truth re-born
With its feet on the grave of Error
 And its eyes to the Easter Morn.
