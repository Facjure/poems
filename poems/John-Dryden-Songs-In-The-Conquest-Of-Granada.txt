I.

Wherever I am, and whatever I do,
My Phyllis is still in my mind;
When angry, I mean not to Phyllis to go,
My feet, of themselves, the way find:
Unknown to myself I am just at her door,
And when I would rail, I can bring out no more,
Than, Phyllis too fair and unkind!

When Phyllis I see, my heart bounds in my breast,
And the love I would stifle is shown;
But asleep or awake I am never at rest,
When from my eyes Phyllis is gone.
Sometimes a sad dream does delude my sad mind;
But, alas! when I wake, and no Phyllis I find,
How I sigh to myself all alone!

Should a king be my rival in her I adore,
He should offer his treasure in vain:
Oh, let me alone to be happy and poor,
And give me my Phyllis again!
Let Phyllis be mine, and but ever be kind,
I could to a desert with her be confined,
And envy no monarch his reign.

Alas! I discover too much of my love,
And she too well knows her own power!
She makes me each day a new martyrdom prove,
And makes me grow jealous each hour:
But let her each minute torment my poor mind,
I had rather love Phyllis, both false and unkind,
Than ever be freed from her power.

II.

HE.How unhappy a lover am I,
While I sigh for my Phyllis in vain:
 All my hopes of delight
 Are another man's right,
Who is happy, while I am in pain!

SHE. Since her honour allows no relief,
But to pity the pains which you bear,
 'Tis the best of your fate,
 In a hopeless estate,
To give o'er, and betimes to despair.

HE.I have tried the false medicine in vain;
For I wish what I hope not to win:
 From without, my desire
 Has no food to its fire;
But it burns and consumes me within.

SHE. Yet, at least, 'tis a pleasure to know
That you are not unhappy alone:
 For the nymph you adore
 Is as wretched, and more;
And counts all your sufferings her own.

HE.O ye gods, let me suffer for both;
At the feet of my Phyllis I'll lie:
 I'll resign up my breath,
 And take pleasure in death,
To be pitied by her when I die.

SHE. What her honour denied you in life,
In her death she will give to your love.
 Such a flame as is true
 After fate will renew,
For the souls to meet closer above.
