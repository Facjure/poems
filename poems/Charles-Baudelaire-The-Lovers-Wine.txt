This morning how grand is the space!
Without bridle or spurs, in our haste
Let us set out by horseback on wine,
For the heavens-enchanted, divine!

Like two angels gone insane
With delirium of the brain,
In the crystal blue of the sky
To the distant mirage we will fly!

Gently swinging within the wing
Of the whirlwind who gives us a ride,
My sister who swims by my side,

In a parallel ecstasy,
Without truce or repose we are bound
For the heaven my dreaming has found!
