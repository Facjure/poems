When I go rowing on the lake,
I long to be a man;
I�ll give my Sunday frock to have
A callous heart like Dan.

I love the ripple of the waves
When gliding o�er the deep,
But when I see the cruel ours,
I close my eyes and weep;

For there are cat-fish in our lake,
And I am filled with dread,
Lest Don should strike a pussy-fish
Upon its tender head.

How would you like it if, some day
An air-ship passing by,
Should flap its cruel, thoughtless oars
And knock you in the eye?

My life would be one long regret
If, for my pleasure vain,
I caused a harmless little fish
An hour of needless pain.

And if Dan�s heavy oars should cause
One little fish to die,
I�d never, never dare to look
Smoked herring in the eye!
