title: The Little Woman And The Pedlar
---

There was a little woman, as I've heard say,
Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol;
She went to market, her eggs for to sell,
Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol.
She went to market all on a market day,
And she fell asleep upon the king's highway;
Fol de rol de lol lol lol lol lol,
Fol, lol, diddle, diddle dol.]

2 And there came a pedlar whose name was Stout,
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
He cut her petticoats all round about,
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
He cut her petticoats up to her knees,
Which made the little woman to shiver and freeze,
Fol de rol, &amp;c.

3 When the little woman began to awake,
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
She began to shiver, and she began to shake,
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
She began to shake, and she began to cry,
Lawk-a-mercy on me! this is none of I,
Fol de rol, &amp;c.

4 If it be I, as I suppose it be,
Fol lol, &amp;c.,
I've a little dog at home, and he knows me;
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
If it be I, he will wag his little tail,
If it be not I, he will bark and rail,
Fol de rol, &amp;c.

5 And when the little woman went home in the dark,
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
Her little dog he did begin to bark,
Fol, lol, &amp;c.,
He began to bark, and she began to cry,
Lawk-a-mercy on me! this is none of I,
Fol de rol, &amp;c.
