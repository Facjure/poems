title: The Two Mules.

 Two mules were bearing on their backs,
 One, oats; the other, silver of the tax.[1]
 The latter glorying in his load,
 March'd proudly forward on the road;
 And, from the jingle of his bell,
 'Twas plain he liked his burden well.
 But in a wild-wood glen
 A band of robber men
 Rush'd forth upon the twain.
 Well with the silver pleased,
 They by the bridle seized
 The treasure-mule so vain.
 Poor mule! in struggling to repel
 His ruthless foes, he fell
 Stabb'd through; and with a bitter sighing,
 He cried, 'Is this the lot they promised me?
 My humble friend from danger free,
 While, weltering in my gore, I'm dying?'
 'My friend,' his fellow-mule replied,
 'It is not well to have one's work too high.
 If thou hadst been a miller's drudge, as I,
 Thou wouldst not thus have died.'
