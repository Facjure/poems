title: A Great Time

Sweet Chance, that led my steps abroad,
 Beyond the town, where wild flowers grow -
A rainbow and a cuckoo, Lord,
 How rich and great the times are now!
Know, all ye sheep
And cows, that keep
On staring that I stand so long
 In grass that's wet from heavy rain -
A rainbow and a cuckoo's song
 May never come together again;
May never come
This side the tomb.
