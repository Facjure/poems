title: In Trafalgar Square.

 The stars shone faint through the smoky blue;
The church-bells were ringing;
 Three girls, arms laced, were passing through,
Tramping and singing.

 Their heads were bare; their short skirts swung
As they went along;
 Their scarf-covered breasts heaved up, as they sung
Their defiant song.

 It was not too clean, their feminine lay,
But it thrilled me quite
 With its challenge to task-master villainous day
And infamous night,

 With its threat to the robber rich, the proud,
The respectable free.
 And I laughed and shouted to them aloud,
And they shouted to me!

 "Girls, that's the shout, the shout we shall utter
When with rifles and spades,
 We stand, with the old Red Flag aflutter,
On the barricades!"
