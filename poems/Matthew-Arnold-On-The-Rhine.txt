title: On The Rhine
---

Vain is the effort to forget.
Some day I shall be cold, I know,
As is the eternal moon-lit snow
Of the high Alps, to which I go:
But ah, not yet! not yet!

Vain is the agony of grief.
�Tis true, indeed, an iron knot
Ties straitly up from mine thy lot,
And were it snapt, thou lov�st me not!
But is despair relief?

Awhile let me with thought have done;
And as this brimm�d unwrinkled Rhine
And that far purple mountain line
Lie sweetly in the look divine
Of the slow-sinking sun;

So let me lie, and calm as they
Let beam upon my inward view
Those eyes of deep, soft, lucent hue,
Eyes too expressive to be blue,
Too lovely to be grey.

Ah Quiet, all things feel thy balm!
Those blue hills too, this river�s flow,
Were restless once, but long ago.
Tam�d is their turbulent youthful glow:
Their joy is in their calm.
