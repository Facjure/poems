Naples, too credulous, ah! boast no more
 The sweet-voiced Siren buried on thy shore,
That, when Parthenope[1] deceas'd, she gave
 Her sacred dust to a Chalcidic[2] grave,
For still she lives, but has exchanged the hoarse
 Pausilipo for Tiber's placid course,
Where, idol of all Rome, she now in chains,
 Of magic song both Gods and Men detains.
