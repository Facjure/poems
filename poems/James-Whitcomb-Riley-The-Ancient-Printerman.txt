 O Printerman of sallow face,
 And look of absent guile,
 Is it the 'copy' on your 'case'
 That causes you to smile?
 Or is it some old treasure scrap
 You call from Memory's file?

 "I fain would guess its mystery -
 For often I can trace
 A fellow dreamer's history
 Whene'er it haunts the face;
 Your fancy's running riot
 In a retrospective race!

 "Ah, Printerman, you're straying
 Afar from 'stick' and type -
 Your heart has 'gone a-maying,'
 And you taste old kisses, ripe
 Again on lips that pucker
 At your old asthmatic pipe!

 "You are dreaming of old pleasures
 That have faded from your view;
 And the music-burdened measures
 Of the laughs you listen to
 Are now but angel-echoes -
 O, have I spoken true?"

 The ancient Printer hinted
 With a motion full of grace
 To where the words were printed
 On a card above his "case," -
 "'I am deaf and dumb!" I left him
 With a smile upon his face.
