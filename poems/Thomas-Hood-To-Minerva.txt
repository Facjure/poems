title: To Minerva

My temples throb, my pulses boil,
I'm sick of Song and Ode and Ballad - 
So Thyrsis, take the midnight oil,
And pour it on a lobster salad.

My brain is dull, my sight is foul,
I cannot write a verse, or read - 
Then Pallas, take away thine Owl,
And let us have a Lark instead.

Thomas Hood.
