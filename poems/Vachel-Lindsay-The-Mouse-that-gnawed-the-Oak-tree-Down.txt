title: The Mouse that gnawed the Oak-tree Down
---

 The mouse that gnawed the oak-tree down
 Began his task in early life.
 He kept so busy with his teeth
 He had no time to take a wife.

 He gnawed and gnawed through sun and rain
 When the ambitious fit was on,
 Then rested in the sawdust till
 A month of idleness had gone.

 He did not move about to hunt
 The coteries of mousie-men.
 He was a snail-paced, stupid thing
 Until he cared to gnaw again.

 The mouse that gnawed the oak-tree down,
 When that tough foe was at his feet - 
 Found in the stump no angel-cake
 Nor buttered bread, nor cheese, nor meat - 
 The forest-roof let in the sky.
 "This light is worth the work," said he.
 "I'll make this ancient swamp more light,"
 And started on another tree.
