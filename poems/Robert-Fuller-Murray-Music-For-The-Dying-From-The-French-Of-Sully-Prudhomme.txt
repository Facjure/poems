---

Ye who will help me in my dying pain,
 Speak not a word: let all your voices cease.
Let me but hear some soft harmonious strain,
 And I shall die at peace.

Music entrances, soothes, and grants relief
 From all below by which we are opprest;
I pray you, speak no word unto my grief,
 But lull it into rest.

Tired am I of all words, and tired of aught
 That may some falsehood from the ear conceal,
Desiring rather sounds which ask no thought,
 Which I need only feel:

 A melody in whose delicious streams
 The soul may sink, and pass without a breath
From fevered fancies into quiet dreams,
 From dreaming into death.
