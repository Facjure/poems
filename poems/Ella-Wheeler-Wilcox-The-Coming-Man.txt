title: The Coming Man
---

Oh! not for the great departed,
 Who formed our country's laws,
And not for the bravest-hearted,
 Who died in freedom's cause,
And not for some living hero
 To whom all bend the knee,
My muse would raise her song of praise - 
 But for the man to be.

For out of the strife which woman
 Is passing through to-day,
A man that is more than human
 Shall yet be born, I say.
A man in whose pure spirit
 No dross of self will lurk;
A man who is strong to cope with wrong,
 A man who is proud to work.

A man with hope undaunted,
 A man with godlike power,
Shall come when he most is wanted,
 Shall come at the needed hour.
He shall silence the din and clamour
 Of clan disputing with clan,
And toil's long fight with purse-proud might
 Shall triumph through this man.

I know he is coming, coming,
 To help, to guide, to save.
Though I hear no martial drumming,
 And see no flags that wave.
But the great soul travail of woman,
 And the bold free thought unfurled,
Are heralds that say he is on the way - 
 The coming man of the world.

Mourn not for vanished ages,
 With their great heroic men,
Who dwell in history's pages
 And live in the poet's pen.
For the grandest times are before us,
 And the world is yet to see
The noblest worth of this old earth
 In the men that are to be.
