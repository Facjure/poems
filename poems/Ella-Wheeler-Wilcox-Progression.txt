To each progressive soul there comes a day
 When all things that have pleased and satisfied
Grow flavourless, the springs of joy seem dried.
 No more the waters of youth's fountains play;
Yet out of reach, tiptoeing as they may,
 The more mature and higher pleasures hide.
Life, like a careless nurse, fails to provide
 New toys for those the soul has cast away.

Upon a strange land's border all alone,
 Awhile it stands dismayed and desolate.
Nude too, since its old garments are outgrown;
 Till clothed with strength befitting its estate,
It grasps at length those raptures that are known
 To souls who learn to labour, and to wait.
