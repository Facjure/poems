Cond� had come with us all the way,
Eight hundred miles, but the fortnight�s rest
Made him fresh as a youngster, the sturdy bay!
And Lurline was looking her very best.

Weary and footsore, the cattle strayed
�Mid the silvery saltbush well content;
Where the creeks lay cool �neath the gidya�s1 shade
The stock-horses clustered, travel-spent.

In the bright spring morning we left them all
Camp, and cattle, and white, and black
And rode for the Range�s westward fall,
Where the dingo�s trail was the only track.

Slow through the clay-pans,2 wet to the knee,
With the cane-grass rustling overhead;
Swift o�er the plains with never a tree;
Up the cliffs by a torrent�s bed.

Bridle on arm for a mile or more
We toiled, ere we reached Bindanna�s verge
And saw, as one sees a far-off shore,
The blue hills bounding the forest surge.

An ocean of trees, by the west wind stirred,
Rolled, ever rolled, to the great cliff�s base;
And its sound like the noise of waves was heard
�Mid the rocks and the caves of that lonely place.

------

We recked not of wealth in stream or soil
As we heard on the heights the breezes sing;
We felt no longer our travel-toil;
We feared no more what the years might bring.
