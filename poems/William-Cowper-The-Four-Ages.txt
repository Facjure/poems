(a brief fragment of an extensive projected poem.)


�I could be well content, allowed the use
Of past experience, and the wisdom glean�d
From worn-out follies, now acknowledged such,
To recommence life�s trial, in the hope
Of fewer errors, on a second proof!�
Thus, while grey evening lull�d the wind, and call�d
Fresh odours from the shrubbery at my side,
Taking my lonely winding walk, I mused,
And held accustom�d conference with my heart;
When from within it thus a voice replied:
�Could�st thou in truth? and art thou taught at length
This wisdom, and but this, from all the past?
Is not the pardon of thy long arrear,
Time wasted, violated laws, abuse
Of talents judgment, mercies, better far
Than opportunity vouchsafed to err
With less excuse, and, haply, worse effect?�
I heard, and acquiesced: then to and fro
Oft pacing, as the mariner his deck,
My gravelly bounds, from self to human kind
I pass�d, and next consider�d�what is man.
Knows he his origin? can he ascend
By reminiscence to his earliest date?
Slept he in Adam? And in those from him
Through numerous generations, till he found
At length his destined moment to be born?
Or was he not, till fashion�d in the womb?
Deep mysteries both! which schoolmen must have toil�d
To unriddle, and have left them mysteries still.
It is an evil incident to man,
And of the worst, that unexplored he leaves
Truths useful and attainable with ease,
To search forbidden deeps, where mystery lies
Not to be solved, and useless if it might.
Mysteries are food for angels; they digest
With ease, and find them nutriment; but man,
While yet he dwells below, must stoop to glean
His manna from the ground, or starve and die.
