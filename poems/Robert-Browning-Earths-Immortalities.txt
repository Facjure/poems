Fame

See, as the prettiest graves will do in time,
Our poet�s wants the freshness of its prime;
Spite of the sexton�s browsing horse, the sods
Have struggled thro� its binding osier-rods;
Headstone and half-sunk footstone lean awry,
Wanting the brick-work promised by-and-by;
How the minute grey lichens, plate o�er plate,
Have softened down the crisp-cut name and date!



Love

So, the year�s done with
(Love me for ever!)
All March begun with,
April�s endeavour;
May-wreaths that bound me
June needs must sever;
Now snows fall round me,
Quenching June�s fever,
(Love me for ever!)
