Here I have heard on hills the battle clash
 Roar to the windy sea that roared again:
 When, drunk with wrath, upon the clanking plain
Barbaric kings did meet in war and dash
Their mailï¿½d thousands down, heard onset crash
 Like crags contending 'gainst the battering main.
 Torrents of helms, beaming like streams of rain,
Blue-billowing 'neath the pale moon's fitful flash;
Saw the scared moon hang over the black wood
 Like a pale wreath of foam; shields, spears, and swords
Shoot green as meteors thro' the steely flood,
 Or shine like ripples 'round their heathen lords
Standing like stubborn rocks, whence the wild wave
Of war circled in steel and foamed out brave on brave.
