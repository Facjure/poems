And now 'tis time for Harvest. Hark! and lo,
 With ringing sound of full melodious horn,
Over yon eastern hill-top all aglow, -
 Her sickle gleaming in the golden morn,
 Her arm upraised with sheaf of yellow corn, -
She comes elate with light, elastic pace;
 Her neck and zone full-clustered vines adorn;
Her saffron locks, fruit-crowned; her luscious grace;
Her round and ripened form; her fair, benignant face.

And now the fields, when suns serenely greet,
 A rich and mellow, wanton joy afford:
The russet pease vines, and the burnished wheat
 And whiter barley, - hating to be stored,
 Guarding with jealous spears their precious hoard, -
The tapering oat-stalk, dangling beads of gold:
 In brilliant sea of beauty all outpoured,
With dazzling depth of splendor all untold,
Where fleets of zephyrs skip in fold that follows fold

Like to a dream I had but yesternight,
 Of pure, transporting, childlike playfulness,
The presence of a fair-haired, blue-eyed, bright,
 Thoughtless and laughing. - Words can not express
 In poet phrase the fulness that did bless
Entrancingly my vision. I advanced
 Behind to worship. Straight each golden tress
Was ruffled and about my face they danced,
Smoth'ring with beauty, while the maiden gleeful glanced.
