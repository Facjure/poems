Towery city and branchy between towers;
Cuckoo-echoing, bell-swarm�d, lark-charm�d, rook- racked, river-rounded;
The dapple-eared lily below thee; that country and town did
Once encounter in, here coped and pois�d powers;

Thou hast a base and brickish skirt there, sours
That neighbour-nature thy grey beauty is grounded
Best in; graceless growth, thou hast confounded
Rural rural keeping - folk, flocks, and flowers.

Yet ah! this air I gather and I release
He lived on; these weeds and waters, these walls are what
He haunted who of all men most sways my spirits to peace;

Of realty the rarest-vein�d unraveller; a not
Rivalled insight, be rival Italy or Greece;
Who fired France for Mary without spot.
