I met him down upon the pier;
 His eyes were wild and sad,
And something in them made me fear
 That he was going mad.

So, being of a prudent sort,
 I stood some distance off,
And before speaking gave a short
 Conciliatory cough.

I then observed, 'What makes you look
 So singularly glum?'
No notice of my words he took.
 I said, 'Pray, are you dumb?'

 'Oh no!' he said, 'I do not think
 My power of speech is lost,
But when one's hopes are black as ink,
 Why, talking is a frost.

'You see, I'm in for Math. again,
 And certain to be ploughed.
Please tell me where I could obtain
 An inexpensive shroud.'

I told him where such things are had,
 Well made, and not too dear;
And, feeling really very sad,
 I left him on the pier.
