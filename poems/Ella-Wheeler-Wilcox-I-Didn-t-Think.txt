title: I Didn't Think
---

If all the troubles in the world
 Were traced back to their start,
We'd find not one in ten begun
 From want of willing heart.
But there's a sly, woe-working elf
 Who lurks about youth's brink,
And sure dismay he brings alway -
 The elf, 'I didn't think.'

He seems so sorry when he's caught;
 His mien is all contrite;
He so regrets the woe he wrought,
 And wants to make things right.
But wishes do not heal a wound
 Or weld a broken link;
The heart aches on, the link is gone,
 All through -'I didn't think.'

I half believe that ugly sprite,
 Bold, wicked, 'I don't care,'
In life's long run less harm has done
 Because he is so rare;
And one can be so stern with him,
 Can make the monster shrink;
But, lack a day, what can we say
 To whining 'Didn't think'?

This most unpleasant imp of strife
 Pursues us everywhere.
There's scarcely one whole day of life
 He does not cause us care;
Small woes and great he brings the world,
 Strong ships are forced to sink,
And trains from iron track are hurled, alack,
 By stupid 'Didn't think.'

When brain is comrade to the heart,
 And heart from soul draws grace,
'I didn't think will quick depart
 For lack of resting-place.
If from that great, unselfish stream,
 The Golden Rule we drink,
We'll keep God's laws, and have no cause
 To say 'I didn't think.'
