title: Oh, It Is Good
---

 Oh, it is good to drink and sup,
 And then beside the kindly fire
 To smoke and heap the faggots up,
 And rest and dream to heart's desire.

 Oh, it is good to ride and run,
 To roam the greenwood wild and free;
 To hunt, to idle in the sun,
 To leap into the laughing sea.

 Oh, it is good with hand and brain
 To gladly till the chosen soil,
 And after honest sweat and strain
 To see the harvest of one's toil.

 Oh, it is good afar to roam,
 And seek adventure in strange lands;
 Yet oh, so good the coming home,
 The velvet love of little hands.

 So much is good. . . . We thank Thee, God,
 For all the tokens Thou hast given,
 That here on earth our feet have trod
 Thy little shining trails of Heaven.
