title: For Old Sake's Sake!
---

 "For old sake's sake!" 'Twere hard to choose
 Words fitter for an old-world Muse
 Than these, that in their cadence bring
 Faint fragrance of the posy-ring,
 And charms that rustic lovers use.

 The long day lengthens, and we lose
 The first pale flush, the morning hues,--
 Ah! but the back-look, lingering,
 For old sake's sake!

 That we retain. Though Time refuse
 To lift the veil on forward views,
 Despot in most, he is not King
 Of those kind memories that cling
 Around his travelled avenues
 For old sake's sake!



 "Qui n'a pas l'esprit de son �ge
 De son �ge a tout le malheur."
 Voltaire.
