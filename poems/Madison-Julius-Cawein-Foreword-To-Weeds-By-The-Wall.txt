 In the first rare spring of song,
In my heart's young hours,
 In my youth 't was thus I sang,
Choosing 'mid the flowers: - 

 "Fair the Dandelion is,
But for me too lowly;
 And the winsome Violet
Is, forsooth, too holy.
 'But the Touchmenot?' Go to!
What! a face that's speckled
 Like a common milking-maid's,
Whom the sun hath freckled.
 Then the Wild-Rose is a flirt;
And the trillium Lily,
 In her spotless gown, 's a prude,
Sanctified and silly.
 By her cap the Columbine,
To my mind, 's too merry;
 Gossips, I would sooner wed
Some plebeian Berry.
 And the shy Anemone - 
Well, her face shows sorrow;
 Pale, goodsooth! alive to-day,
Dead and gone to-morrow.
 Then that bold-eyed, buxom wench,
Big and blond and lazy, - 
 She's been chosen overmuch! - 
Sirs, I mean the Daisy.
 Pleasant persons are they all,
And their virtues many;
 Faith I know but good of each,
And naught ill of any.
 But I choose a May-apple;
She shall be my Lady;
 Blooming, hidden and refined,
Sweet in places shady."

 In my youth 'twas thus I sang,
In my heart's young hours,
 In the first rare spring of song,
Choosing 'mid the flowers.
 So I hesitated when
Time alone was reckoned
 By the hours that Fancy smiled,
Love and Beauty beckoned.
 Hard it was for me to choose
From the flowers that flattered;
 And the blossom that I chose
Soon lay dead and scattered.
 Hard I found it then, ah, me!
Hard I found the choosing;
 Harder, harder since I've found,
Ah, too hard the losing.
 Haply had I chosen then
From the weeds that tangle
 Wayside, woodland and the wall
Of my garden's angle,
 I had chosen better, yea,
For these later hours - 
 Longer last the weeds, and oft
Sweeter are than flowers.
