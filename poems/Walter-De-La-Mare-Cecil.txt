 Ye little elves, who haunt sweet dells,
 Where flowers with the dew commune,
 I pray you hush the child, Cecil,
 With windlike song.

 O little elves, so white she lieth,
 Each eyelid gentler than the flow'r
 Of the bramble, and her fleecy hair
 Like smoke of gold.

 O little elves, her hands and feet
 The angels muse upon, and God
 Hath shut a glimpse of Paradise
 In each blue eye.

 O little elves, her tiny body
 Like a white flake of snow it is,
 Drooping upon the pale green hood
 Of the chill snowdrop.

 O little elves, with elderflower,
 And pimpernel, and the white hawthorn,
 Sprinkle the journey of her dreams:
 And, little elves,

 Call to her magically sweet,
 Lest of her very tenderness
 She do forsake this rough brown earth
 And return to us no more.
