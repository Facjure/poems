For thee the birds shall never sing again,
 Nor fresh green leaves come out upon the tree,
The brook shall no more murmur the refrain
For thee.

Thou liest underneath the windswept lea,
 Thou dreamest not of pleasure or of pain,
Thou dreadest no to-morrow that shall be.

Deep rest is thine, unbroken by the rain,
 Ay, or the thunder.Brother, canst thou see
The tears that night and morning fall in vain
For thee?
