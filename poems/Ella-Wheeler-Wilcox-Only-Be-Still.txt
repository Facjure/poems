title: Only Be Still
---

'Only be still, and in the silence grow,'
If thou art seeking what the gods bestow.
 This is the simple, safe, and certain way
 That leads to knowledge for which all men pray
Of higher laws to govern things below.

But in our restless discontent we go
 With noisy importuning day on day - 
 Drowning the inner voice that strives to say
'Only be still, and in the silence grow.'

We doubt, we cavil, and we talk of woe - 
We delve in books, and waste our forces so;
 We cling to creeds that were not meant to stay,
 And close our ears to Truth's immortal lay.
Oh wouldst thou see, and understand, and know?
'Only be still, and in the silence grow.'
