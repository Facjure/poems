Music--"Jess Macfarlane."




Oh, this love--this love!
I ainse the passion slighted;
But hearts that truly love,
Must break or be united.
Oh, this love!

When first he cam' to woo,
I little cared aboot him;
But seene I felt as though
I could na' live without him.
Oh, this love!

He brought to me the ring,
My hand asked o' my mither--
I could na' bear the thought
That he should we anither.
Oh, this love!

And now I'm a' his ain--
In a' his joys I mingle;
Nae for the wealth of warlds
Wad I again be single!
Oh, this love!
