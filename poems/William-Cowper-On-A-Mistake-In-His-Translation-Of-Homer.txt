author: William Cowper 
title: On A Mistake In His Translation Of Homer.
---

Cowper had sinnï¿½d with some excuse,
If, bound in rhyming tethers,
He had committed this abuse
Of changing ewes for wethers;[1]


But, male for female is a trope,
Or rather bold misnomer,
That would have startled even Pope,
When he translated Homer.
