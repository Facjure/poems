I see you, refulgent ones,
Burning so steadily
Like big white arc lights...
There are so many of you.
I like to watch you weaving - 
Altogether and with precision
Each his ray - 
Your tracery of light,
Making a shining way about America.

I note your infinite reactions - 
In glassware
And sequin
And puddles
And bits of jet - 
And here and there a diamond...

But you do not yet see me,
Who am a torch blown along the wind,
Flickering to a spark
But never out.
