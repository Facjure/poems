title: Too Young For Love
---

Too young for love?
Ah, say not so!
Tell reddening rose-buds not to blow
Wait not for spring to pass away, - 
Love's summer months begin with May!
Too young for love?
Ah, say not so!
Too young? Too young?
Ah, no! no! no!

Too young for love?
Ah, say not so,
To practise all love learned in May.
June soon will come with lengthened day
While daisies bloom and tulips glow!

Too young for love?
Ah, say not so!
Too young? Too young?
Ah, no! no! no!
