title: A Song For Old Age.

Now nights grow cold and colder,
 And North the wild vane swings,
And round each tree and boulder
 The driving snow-storm sings - 
Come, make my old heart older,
 O memory of lost things!

Of Hope, when promise sung her
 Brave songs and I was young,
That banquets now on hunger
 Since all youth's songs are sung;
Of Love, who walks with younger
 Sweethearts the flowers among.

Ah, well! while Life holds levee,
 Death's ceaseless dance goes on.
So let the curtains, heavy
 About my couch, be drawn - 
The curtains, sad and heavy,
 Where all shall sleep anon.
