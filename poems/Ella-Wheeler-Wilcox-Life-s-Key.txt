title: Life's Key
---

The hand that fashioned me, tuned my ear
 To chord with the major key,
In the darkest moments of life I hear
Strains of courage, and hope, and cheer
 From choirs that I cannot see.
And the music of life seems so inspired
That it will not let me grow sad or tired.

Yet through and under the major strain,
 I hear with the passing of years,
The mournful minor measure of pain,
Of souls that struggle and toil in vain
 For a goal that never nears.
And the sorrowful cadence of good gone wrong,
Breaks more and more into earth's glad song.

And oft in the dark of the night I wake
 And think of sorrowing lives,
And I long to comfort the hearts that ache,
To sweeten the cup that is bitter to take,
 And to strengthen each soul that strives.
I long to cry to them 'Do not fear,
Help is coming and aid is near.'

However desolate, weird, or strange
 Life's melody sounds to you,
Before to-morrow the air may change,
And the Great Director of music arrange
 A programme perfectly new.
And the dirge in minor may suddenly be
Turned into a jubilant song of glee.
