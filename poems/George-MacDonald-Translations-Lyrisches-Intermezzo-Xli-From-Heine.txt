I dreamt of the daughter of a king,
 With white cheeks tear-bewetted;
We sat 'neath the lime tree's leavy ring,
 In love's embraces netted.

"I would not have thy father's throne,
 His crown or his golden sceptre;
I want my lovely princess alone--
 From Fate that so long hath kept her."

"That cannot be," she said to me:
 "I lie in the grave uncheerly;
And only at night I come to thee,
 Because I love thee so dearly."
