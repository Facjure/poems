Blest Ruler, at whose word
The universe was stirred,
And there was light;
Look now with gracious love
From Thy bright home above,
Direct in every move,
Each proved, Sir Knight.

In mysteries well skilled,
Their hearts with courage filled,
Behold they stand;
Strengthen their faith in thee,
Let hope their anchor be,
And heaven-born charity
Mark their command.

Endure with holy light
Each suppliant, Sir Knight;
May each one prove
Faithful in watch and word;
Strong the oppressed, to guard
And win the just reward
Of Faith and Love.
