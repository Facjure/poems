title: Factory Windows are always Broken
---

 Factory windows are always broken.
 Somebody's always throwing bricks,
 Somebody's always heaving cinders,
 Playing ugly Yahoo tricks.

 Factory windows are always broken.
 Other windows are let alone.
 No one throws through the chapel-window
 The bitter, snarling, derisive stone.

 Factory windows are always broken.
 Something or other is going wrong.
 Something is rotten - I think, in Denmark.
 End of the factory-window song.
