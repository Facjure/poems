---

Struggle not with thy life! - the heavy doom
 Resist not, it will bow thee like a slave:
Strive not! thou shalt not conquer; to thy tomb
 Thou shalt go crushed, and ground, though ne'er so brave.

Complain not of thy life! - for what art thou
 More than thy fellows, that thou should'st not weep?
Brave thoughts still lodge beneath a furrowed brow,
 And the way-wearied have the sweetest sleep.

Marvel not at thy life! - patience shall see
 The perfect work of wisdom to her given;
Hold fast thy soul through this high mystery,
 And it shall lead thee to the gates of heaven.
