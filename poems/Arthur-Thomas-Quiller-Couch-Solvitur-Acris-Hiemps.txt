 My Juggins, see: the pasture green,
Obeying Nature's kindly law,
 Renews its mantle; there has been
A thaw.

 The frost-bound earth is free at last,
That lay 'neath Winter's sullen yoke
'Till people felt it getting past
A joke.

 Now forth again the Freshers fare,
And get them tasty summer suits
 Wherein they flaunt afield and scare
The brutes.

 Again the stream suspects the keel;
Again the shrieking captain drops
 Upon his crew; again the meal
Of chops

 Divides the too-laborious day;
Again the Student sighs o'er Mods,
 And prompts his enemies to lay
Long odds.

 Again the shopman spreads his wiles;
Again the organ-pipes, unbound,
 Distract the populace for miles
Around.

 Then, Juggins, ere December's touch
Once more the wealth of Spring reclaim,
 Since each successive year is much
The same;

 Since too the monarch on his throne
In purple lapped and frankincense,
 Who from his infancy has blown
Expense,

 No less than he who barely gets
The boon of out-of-door relief,
 Must see desuetude,--come let's
Be brief.

 At those resolves last New Year's Day
The easy gods indulgent wink.
 Then downward, ho!--the shortest way
Is drink.
