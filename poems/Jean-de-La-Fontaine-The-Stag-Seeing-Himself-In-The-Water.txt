[1]

 Beside a placid, crystal flood,
 A stag admired the branching wood
 That high upon his forehead stood,
 But gave his Maker little thanks
 For what he call'd his spindle shanks.
 'What limbs are these for such a head! - 
 So mean and slim!' with grief he said.
 'My glorious heads o'ertops
 The branches of the copse;
 My legs are my disgrace.'
 As thus he talk'd, a bloodhound gave him chase.
 To save his life he flew
 Where forests thickest grew.
 His horns, - pernicious ornament! - 
 Arresting him where'er he went,
 Did unavailing render
 What else, in such a strife,
 Had saved his precious life - 
 His legs, as fleet as slender.
 Obliged to yield, he cursed the gear
 Which nature gave him every year.

 Too much the beautiful we prize;
 The useful, often, we despise:
 Yet oft, as happen'd to the stag,
 The former doth to ruin drag.
