"Peek-a-boo!" say little Olaf.
 "Yu can't find me. Ay ban hid."
Den ay used to look all over
 For my little blue-eyed kid.
Op in attic, down in cellar,
 Back of chairs on parlor floor;
Den he used to laugh, and tal me,
 "Ay ban back of kitchen door."

"Peek-a-boo!" he used to tal me.
 "Shut yure eyes, and don't you peek!"
Den ay feel his arms around me
 And his kisses on my cheek.
"Now ay'm hiding, dad," he tal me!
 "Maybe, ef you look some more,
Yu skol find yure little Olaf - 
 Ay ban back of kitchen door."

"Peek-a-boo!" ay hear him calling,
 Lak he called long time ago.
Var ban little Olaf hiding?
 Maybe anyel fallers know.
Tousand times ay look to find him
 Hiding back of kitchen door,
But ay only see some shadows:
 Ay can't find him any more.
