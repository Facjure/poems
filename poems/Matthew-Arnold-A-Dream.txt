Was it a dream? We sail�d, I thought we sail�d,
Martin and I, down a green Alpine stream,
Under o�erhanging pines; the morning sun,
On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops,
On the red pinings of their forest floor,
Drew a warm scent abroad; behind the pines
The mountain skirts, with all their sylvan change
Of bright-leaf�d chestnuts, and moss�d walnut-trees,
And the frail scarlet-berried ash, began.
Swiss chalets glitter�d on the dewy slopes,
And from some swarded shelf high up, there came
Notes of wild pastoral music: over all
Rang�d, diamond-bright, the eternal wall of snow.
Upon the mossy rocks at the stream�s edge.
Back�d by the pines, a plank-built cottage stood,
Bright in the sun; the climbing gourd-plant�s leaves
Muffled its walls, and on the stone-strewn roof
Lay the warm golden gourds; golden, within,
Under the eaves, peer�d rows of Indian corn.
We shot beneath the cottage with the stream.
On the brown rude-carv�d balcony two Forms
Came forth, Olivia�s, Marguerite! and thine.
Clad were they both in white, flowers in their breast;
Straw hats bedeck�d their heads, with ribbons blue
Which wav�d, and on their shoulders fluttering play�d.
They saw us, they conferr�d; their bosoms heav�d,
And more than mortal impulse fill�d their eyes.
Their lips mov�d; their white arms, wav�d eagerly,
Flash�d once, like falling streams:, we rose, we gaz�d
One moment, on the rapid�s top, our boat
Hung pois�d, and then the darting River of Life,
Loud thundering, bore us by: swift, swift it foam�d;
Black under cliffs it rac�d, round headlands shone.
Soon the plank�d cottage �mid the sun-warm�d pines
Faded, the moss, the rocks; us burning Plains
Bristled with cities, us the Sea receiv�d
