title: Song: Fear in the Night.
---

I am afraid to-night,
We are too glad, too gay,
Our life too sweet, too bright
To last another day.

What hap, what chance can fall,
What sorrow come, what schism,
What loss, what cataclysm
To part us two at all?

The stars with ageless fire
In skies serene the same
Observe our young desire
And watch our loves aflame.

A whisper soft, a sound
Unfollowed, unattended,
Shakes all the branches round:
They sleep and it is ended.

You sleep and I alone
Torment myself with fear
For new joys coming near
And gracious actions done.

I am afraid to-night,
We are too glad, too gay,
Our life too sweet, too bright
To last another day.
