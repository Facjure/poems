When He appoints to meet thee, go thou forth,
It matters not
If south or north,
Bleak waste or sunny plot.
Nor think, if haply He thou seek�st be late,
He does thee wrong.
To stile or gate
Lean thou thy head, and long!
It may be that to spy thee He is mounting
Upon a tower,
Or in thy counting
Thou hast mista�en the hour.
But, if He comes not, neither do thou go
Till Vesper chime.
Belike thou then shalt know
He hath been with thee all the time.
