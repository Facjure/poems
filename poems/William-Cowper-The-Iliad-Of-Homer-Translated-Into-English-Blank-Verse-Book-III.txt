 Argument Of The Third Book.


The armies meet. Paris throws out a challenge to the Grecian Princes. Menelaus accepts it. The terms of the combat are adjusted solemnly by Agamemnon on the part of Greece, and by Priam on the part of Troy. The combat ensues, in which Paris is vanquished, whom yet Venus rescues. Agamemnon demands from the Trojans a performance of the covenant.



 [1]Now marshall'd all beneath their several chiefs,
 With deafening shouts, and with the clang of arms,
 The host of Troy advanced. Such clang is heard
 Along the skies, when from incessant showers
 Escaping, and from winter's cold, the cranes
 Take wing, and over Ocean speed away;[2]
 Wo to the land of dwarfs! prepared they fly
 For slaughter of the small Pygm�an race.
 Not so the Greeks; they breathing valor came,
 But silent all, and all with faithful hearts
 On succor mutual to the last, resolved.
 As when the south wind wraps the mountain top
 In mist the shepherd's dread, but to the thief
 Than night itself more welcome, and the eye
 Is bounded in its ken to a stone's cast,
 Such from beneath their footsteps dun and dense
 Uprose the dust, for swift they cross the plain.
 When, host to host opposed, full nigh they stood,
 Then Alexander[3] in the Trojan van
 Advanced was seen, all beauteous as a God;
 His leopard's skin, his falchion and his bow
 Hung from his shoulder; bright with heads of brass
 He shook two spears, and challenged to the fight
 The bravest Argives there, defying all.
 Him, striding haughtily his host before
 When Menelaus saw, such joy he felt
 As hunger-pinch'd the lion feels, by chance
 Conducted to some carcase huge, wild goat,
 Or antler'd stag; huntsmen and baying hounds
 Disturb not him, he gorges in their sight.
 So Menelaus at the view rejoiced
 Of lovely Alexander, for he hoped
 His punishment at hand. At once, all armed,
 Down from his chariot to the ground he leap'd
 When godlike Paris him in front beheld
 Conspicuous, his heart smote him, and his fate
 Avoiding, far within the lines he shrank.[4]
 As one, who in some woodland height descrying
 A serpent huge, with sudden start recoils,
 His limbs shake under him; with cautious step
 He slow retires; fear blanches cold his cheeks;
 So beauteous Alexander at the sight
 Of Atreus' son dishearten'd sore, the ranks
 Of haughty Trojans enter'd deep again:
 Him Hector eyed, and thus rebuked severe.
 Curst Paris! Fair deceiver! Woman-mad!
 I would to all in heaven that thou hadst died
 Unborn, at least unmated! happier far
 Than here to have incurr'd this public shame!
 Well may the Grecians taunt, and laughing loud,
 Applaud the champion, slow indeed to fight
 And pusillanimous, but wondrous fair.
 Wast thou as timid, tell me, when with those
 Thy loved companions in that famed exploit,
 Thou didst consort with strangers, and convey
 From distant lands a warrior's beauteous bride
 To be thy father's and his people's curse,
 Joy to our foes, but to thyself reproach?
 Behold her husband! Darest thou not to face
 The warlike prince? Now learn how brave a Chief
 Thou hast defrauded of his blooming spouse.
 Thy lyre, thy locks, thy person, specious gifts
 Of partial Venus, will avail thee nought,
 Once mixt by Menelaus with the dust.
 But we are base ourselves, or long ago,
 For all thy numerous mischiefs, thou hadst slept
 Secure beneath a coverlet[5] of stone.[6]
 Then godlike Alexander thus replied.
 Oh Hector, true in temper as the axe
 Which in the shipwright's hand the naval plank
 Divides resistless, doubling all his force,
 Such is thy dauntless spirit whose reproach
 Perforce I own, nor causeless nor unjust.
 Yet let the gracious gifts uncensured pass
 Of golden Venus; man may not reject
 The glorious bounty by the Gods bestow'd,
 Nor follows their beneficence our choice.
 But if thy pleasure be that I engage
 With Menelaus in decision fierce
 Of desperate combat bid the host of Troy
 And bid the Grecians sit; then face to face
 Commit us, in the vacant field between,
 To fight for Helen and for all her wealth.
 Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her
 And hers possess'd shall bear them safe away;
 While ye (peace sworn and firm accord) shall dwell
 At Troy, and these to Argos shall return
 And to Achaia praised for women fair.
 He ceased, whom Hector heard with joy; he moved
 Into the middle space, and with his spear
 Advanced athwart push'd back the Trojan van,
 And all stood fast. Meantime at him the Greeks
 Discharged full volley, showering thick around
 From bow and sling;[7] when with a mighty voice
 Thus Agamemnon, leader of the host.
 Argives! Be still--shoot not, ye sons of Greece!
 Hector bespeaks attention. Hear the Chief!
 He said, at once the Grecians ceased to shoot,
 And all sat silent. Hector then began.
 Hear me, ye Trojans, and ye Greeks mail-arm'd,
 While I shall publish in your ears the words
 Of Alexander, author of our strife.
 Trojans, he bids, and Grecians on the field
 Their arms dispose; while he, the hosts between,
 With warlike Menelaus shall in fight
 Contend for Helen, and for all her wealth.
 Who strongest proves, and conquers, he, of her
 And hers possess'd, shall bear them safe away,
 And oaths of amity shall bind the rest.
 He ceased, and all deep silence held, amazed;
 When valiant Menelaus thus began.
 Hear now me also, on whose aching heart
 These woes have heaviest fallen. At last I hope
 Decision near, Trojans and Greeks between,
 For ye have suffer'd in my quarrel much,
 And much by Paris, author of the war.
 Die he who must, and peace be to the rest.
 But ye shall hither bring two lambs, one white,
 The other black;[8] this to the Earth devote,
 That to the Sun. We shall ourselves supply
 A third for Jove. Then bring ye Priam forth,
 Himself to swear the covenant, (for his sons
 Are faithless) lest the oath of Jove be scorn'd.
 Young men are ever of unstable mind;
 But when an elder interferes, he views
 Future and past together, and insures
 The compact, to both parties, uninfringed.
 So Menelaus spake; and in all hearts
 Awaken'd joyful hope that there should end
 War's long calamities. Alighted each,
 And drew his steeds into the lines. The field
 Glitter'd with arms put off, and side by side,
 Ranged orderly, while the interrupted war
 Stood front to front, small interval between.
 Then Hector to the city sent in haste
 Two heralds for the lambs, and to invite
 Priam; while Agamemnon, royal Chief,
 Talthybius to the Grecian fleet dismiss'd
 For a third lamb to Jove; nor he the voice
 Of noble Agamemnon disobey'd.
 Iris, ambassadress of heaven, the while,
 To Helen came. La�dice she seem'd,
 Loveliest of all the daughters of the house
 Of Priam, wedded to Antenor's son,
 King Helic�on. Her she found within,
 An ample web magnificent she wove,[9]
 Inwrought with numerous conflicts for her sake
 Beneath the hands of Mars endured by Greeks
 Mail-arm'd, and Trojans of equestrian fame.
 Swift Iris, at her side, her thus address'd.
 Haste, dearest nymph! a wondrous sight behold!
 Greeks brazen-mail'd, and Trojans steed-renown'd.
 So lately on the cruel work of Mars
 Intent and hot for mutual havoc, sit
 Silent; the war hath paused, and on his shield
 Each leans, his long spear planted at his side.
 Paris and Menelaus, warrior bold,
 With quivering lances shall contend for thee,
 And thou art his who conquers; his for ever.
 So saying, the Goddess into Helen's soul
 Sweetest desire infused to see again
 Her former Lord, her parents, and her home.
 At once o'ermantled with her snowy veil
 She started forth, and as she went let fall
 A tender tear; not unaccompanied
 She went, but by two maidens of her train
 Attended, �thra, Pittheus' daughter fair,
 And soft-eyed Clymene. Their hasty steps
 Convey'd them quickly to the Sc�an gate.
 There Priam, Panthous, Clytius, Lampus sat,
 Thymoetes, Hicetaon, branch of Mars,
 Antenor and Ucalegon the wise,
 All, elders of the people; warriors erst,
 But idle now through age, yet of a voice
 Still indefatigable as the fly's[10]
 Which perch'd among the boughs sends forth at noon
 Through all the grove his slender ditty sweet.
 Such sat those Trojan leaders on the tower,
 Who, soon as Helen on the steps they saw,
 In accents quick, but whisper'd, thus remark'd.
 Trojans and Grecians wage, with fair excuse,
 Long war for so much beauty.[11] Oh, how like
 In feature to the Goddesses above!
 Pernicious loveliness! Ah, hence away,
 Resistless as thou art and all divine,
 Nor leave a curse to us, and to our sons.
 So they among themselves; but Priam call'd
 Fair Helen to his side.[12] My daughter dear!
 Come, sit beside me. Thou shalt hence discern
 Thy former Lord, thy kindred and thy friends.
 I charge no blame on thee. The Gods have caused,
 Not thou, this lamentable war to Troy.[13]
 Name to me yon Achaian Chief for bulk
 Conspicuous, and for port. Taller indeed
 I may perceive than he; but with these eyes
 Saw never yet such dignity, and grace.
 Declare his name. Some royal Chief he seems.
 To whom thus Helen, loveliest of her sex,
 My other Sire! by me for ever held
 In reverence, and with filial fear beloved!
 Oh that some cruel death had been my choice,
 Rather than to abandon, as I did,
 All joys domestic, matrimonial bliss,
 Brethren, dear daughter, and companions dear,
 A wanderer with thy son. Yet I alas!
 Died not, and therefore now, live but to weep.
 But I resolve thee. Thou behold'st the son
 Of Atreus, Agamemnon, mighty king,
 In arms heroic, gracious in the throne,
 And, (though it shame me now to call him such,)
 By nuptial ties a brother once to me.
 Then him the ancient King-admiring, said.
 Oh blest Atrides, happy was thy birth,
 And thy lot glorious, whom this gallant host
 So numerous, of the sons of Greece obey!
 To vine-famed Phrygia, in my days of youth,
 I journey'd; many Phrygians there I saw,
 Brave horsemen, and expert; they were the powers
 Of Otreus and of Mygdon, godlike Chief,
 And on the banks of Sangar's stream encamp'd.
 I march'd among them, chosen in that war
 Ally of Phrygia, and it was her day
 Of conflict with the man-defying race,
 The Amazons; yet multitudes like these
 Thy bright-eyed Greeks, I saw not even there.
 The venerable King observing next
 Ulysses, thus inquired. My child, declare
 Him also. Shorter by the head he seems
 Than Agamemnon, Atreus' mighty son,
 But shoulder'd broader, and of ampler chest;
 He hath disposed his armor on the plain,
 But like a ram, himself the warrior ranks
 Ranges majestic; like a ram full-fleeced
 By numerous sheep encompass'd snowy-white.
 To whom Jove's daughter Helen thus replied.
 In him the son of old La�rtes know,
 Ulysses; born in Ithaca the rude,
 But of a piercing wit, and deeply wise.
 Then answer thus, Antenor sage return'd.
 Princess thou hast described him: hither once
 The noble Ithacan, on thy behalf
 Ambassador with Menelaus, came:
 Beneath my roof, with hospitable fare
 Friendly I entertained them. Seeing then
 Occasion opportune, I closely mark'd
 The genius and the talents of the Chiefs,
 And this I noted well; that when they stood
 Amid the assembled counsellors of Troy,
 Then Menelaus his advantage show'd,
 Who by the shoulders overtopp'd his friend.
 But when both sat, Ulysses in his air
 Had more of state and dignity than he.
 In the delivery of a speech address'd
 To the full senate, Menelaus used
 Few words, but to the matter, fitly ranged,
 And with much sweetness utter'd; for in loose
 And idle play of ostentatious terms
 He dealt not, though he were the younger man.
 But when the wise Ulysses from his seat
 Had once arisen, he would his downcast eyes
 So rivet on the earth, and with a hand
 That seem'd untutor'd in its use, so hold
 His sceptre, swaying it to neither side,
 That hadst thou seen him, thou hadst thought him, sure,
 Some chafed and angry idiot, passion-fixt.
 Yet, when at length, the clear and mellow base
 Of his deep voice brake forth, and he let fall
 His chosen words like flakes of feather'd snow,
 None then might match Ulysses; leisure, then,
 Found none to wonder at his noble form.
 The third of whom the venerable king
 Inquired, was Ajax.--Yon Achaian tall,
 Whose head and shoulders tower above the rest,
 And of such bulk prodigious--who is he?
 Him answer'd Helen, loveliest of her sex.
 A bulwark of the Greeks. In him thou seest
 Gigantic Ajax. Opposite appear
 The Cretans, and among the Chiefs of Crete
 stands, like a God, Idomeneus. Him oft
 From Crete arrived, was Menela�s wont
 To entertain; and others now I see,
 Achaians, whom I could recall to mind,
 And give to each his name; but two brave youths
 I yet discern not; for equestrian skill
 One famed, and one a boxer never foiled;
 My brothers; born of Leda; sons of Jove;
 Castor and Pollux. Either they abide
 In lovely Sparta still, or if they came,
 Decline the fight, by my disgrace abash'd
 And the reproaches which have fallen on me.[14]
 She said; but they already slept inhumed
 In Lacedemon, in their native soil.
 And now the heralds, through the streets of Troy
 Charged with the lambs, and with a goat-skin filled
 With heart-exhilarating wine prepared
 For that divine solemnity, return'd.
 Id�us in his hand a beaker bore
 Resplendent, with its fellow cups of gold,
 And thus he summon'd ancient Priam forth.
 Son of La�medon, arise. The Chiefs
 Call thee, the Chiefs of Ilium and of Greece.
 Descend into the plain. We strike a truce,
 And need thine oath to bind it. Paris fights
 With warlike Menela�s for his spouse;
 Their spears decide the strife. The conqueror wins
 Helen and all her treasures. We, thenceforth,
 (Peace sworn and amity) shall dwell secure
 In Troy, while they to Argos shall return
 And to Achaia praised for women fair.
 He spake, and Priam, shuddering, bade his train
 Prepare his steeds; they sedulous obey'd.
 First, Priam mounting, backward stretch'd the reins;
 Antenor, next, beside him sat, and through
 The Sc�an gate they drove into the plain.
 Arriving at the hosts of Greece and Troy
 They left the chariot, and proceeded both
 Into the interval between the hosts.
 Then uprose Agamemnon, and uprose
 All-wise Ulysses. Next, the heralds came
 Conspicuous forward, expediting each
 The ceremonial; they the beaker fill'd
 With wine, and to the hands of all the kings
 Minister'd water. Agamemnon then
 Drawing his dagger which he ever bore
 Appendant to his heavy falchion's sheath,
 Cut off the forelocks of the lambs,[15] of which
 The heralds gave to every Grecian Chief
 A portion, and to all the Chiefs of Troy.
 Then Agamemnon raised his hands, and pray'd.
 Jove, Father, who from Ida stretchest forth
 Thine arm omnipotent, o'erruling all,
 And thou, all-seeing and all-hearing Sun,
 Ye Rivers, and thou conscious Earth, and ye
 Who under earth on human kind avenge
 Severe, the guilt of violated oaths,
 Hear ye, and ratify what now we swear!
 Should Paris slay the hero amber-hair'd,
 My brother Menela�s, Helen's wealth
 And Helen's self are his, and all our host
 Shall home return to Greece; but should it chance
 That Paris fall by Menela�s' hand,
 Then Troy shall render back what she detains,
 With such amercement as is meet, a sum
 To be remember'd in all future times.
 Which penalty should Priam and his sons
 Not pay, though Paris fall, then here in arms
 I will contend for payment of the mulct
 My due, till, satisfied, I close the war.
 He said, and with his ruthless steel the lambs
 Stretch'd panting all, but soon they ceased to pant,
 For mortal was the stroke.[16] Then drawing forth
 Wine from the beaker, they with brimming cups
 Hail'd the immortal Gods, and pray'd again,
 And many a Grecian thus and Trojan spake.
 All-glorious Jove, and ye the powers of heaven,
 Whoso shall violate this contract first,
 So be the brains of them and of their sons
 Pour'd out, as we this wine pour on the earth,
 And may their wives bring forth to other men!
 So they: but them Jove heard not. Then arose
 Priam, the son of Dardanus, and said,
 Hear me, ye Trojans and ye Greeks well-arm'd.
 Hence back to wind-swept Ilium I return,
 Unable to sustain the sight, my son
 With warlike Menela�s match'd in arms.
 Jove knows, and the immortal Gods, to whom
 Of both, this day is preordain'd the last.
 So spake the godlike monarch, and disposed
 Within the royal chariot all the lambs;
 Then, mounting, check'd the reins; Antenor next
 Ascended, and to Ilium both return'd.
 First, Hector and Ulysses, noble Chief,
 Measured the ground; then taking lots for proof
 Who of the combatants should foremost hurl
 His spear, they shook them in a brazen casque;
 Meantime the people raised their hands on high,
 And many a Grecian thus and Trojan prayed.
 Jove, Father, who on Ida seated, seest
 And rulest all below, glorious in power!
 Of these two champions, to the drear abodes
 Of Ades him appoint who furnish'd first
 The cause of strife between them, and let peace
 Oath-bound, and amity unite the rest!
 So spake the hosts; then Hector shook the lots,
 Majestic Chief, turning his face aside.
 Forth sprang the lot of Paris. They in ranks
 Sat all, where stood the fiery steeds of each,
 And where his radiant arms lay on the field.
 Illustrious Alexander his bright arms
 Put on, fair Helen's paramour. [17]He clasp'd
 His polish'd greaves with silver studs secured;
 His brother's corselet to his breast he bound,
 Lycaon's, apt to his own shape and size,
 And slung athwart his shoulders, bright emboss'd,
 His brazen sword; his massy buckler broad
 He took, and to his graceful head his casque
 Adjusted elegant, which, as he moved,
 Its bushy crest waved dreadful; last he seized,
 Well fitted to his gripe, his ponderous spear.
 Meantime the hero Menela�s made
 Like preparation, and his arms put on.
 When thus, from all the multitude apart,
 Both combatants had arm'd, with eyes that flash'd
 Defiance, to the middle space they strode,
 Trojans and Greeks between. Astonishment
 Seized all beholders. On the measured ground
 Full near they stood, each brandishing on high
 His massy spear, and each was fiery wroth.
 First, Alexander his long-shadow'd spear
 Sent forth, and on his smooth shield's surface struck
 The son of Atreus, but the brazen guard
 Pierced not, for at the disk, with blunted point
 Reflex, his ineffectual weapon stay'd.
 Then Menela�s to the fight advanced
 Impetuous, after prayer offer'd to Jove.[18]
 King over all! now grant me to avenge
 My wrongs on Alexander; now subdue
 The aggressor under me; that men unborn
 May shudder at the thought of faith abused,
 And hospitality with rape repaid.
 He said, and brandishing his massy spear,
 Dismiss'd it. Through the burnish'd buckler broad
 Of Priam's son the stormy weapon flew,
 Transpierced his costly hauberk, and the vest
 Ripp'd on his flank; but with a sideward bend
 He baffled it, and baulk'd the dreadful death.
 Then Menela�s drawing his bright blade,
 Swung it aloft, and on the hairy crest
 Smote him; but shiver'd into fragments small
 The falchion at the stroke fell from his hand.
 Vexation fill'd him; to the spacious heavens
 He look'd, and with a voice of wo exclaim'd--
 Jupiter! of all powers by man adored
 To me most adverse! Confident I hoped
 Revenge for Paris' treason, but my sword
 Is shivered, and I sped my spear in vain.
 So saying, he sprang on him, and his long crest
 Seized fast; then, turning, drew him by that hold
 Toward the Grecian host. The broider'd band
 That underbraced his helmet at the chin,
 Strain'd to his smooth neck with a ceaseless force,
 Chok'd him; and now had Menelaus won
 Deathless renown, dragging him off the field,
 But Venus, foam-sprung Goddess, feeling quick
 His peril imminent, snapp'd short the brace
 Though stubborn, by a slaughter'd[19] ox supplied,
 And the void helmet follow'd as he pull'd.
 That prize the Hero, whirling it aloft,
 Threw to his Greeks, who caught it and secured,
 Then with vindictive strides he rush'd again
 On Paris, spear in hand; but him involved
 In mist opaque Venus with ease divine
 Snatch'd thence, and in his chamber placed him, fill'd
 With scents odorous, spirit-soothing sweets.
 Nor stay'd the Goddess, but at once in quest
 Of Helen went; her on a lofty tower
 She found, where many a damsel stood of Troy,
 And twitch'd her fragrant robe. In form she seem'd
 An ancient matron, who, while Helen dwelt
 In Laced�mon, her unsullied wool
 Dress'd for her, faithfullest of all her train.
 Like her disguised the Goddess thus began.
 Haste--Paris calls thee--on his sculptured couch,
 (Sparkling alike his looks and his attire)
 He waits thy wish'd return. Thou wouldst not dream
 That he had fought; he rather seems prepared
 For dance, or after dance, for soft repose.
 So saying, she tumult raised in Helen's mind.
 Yet soon as by her symmetry of neck,
 By her love-kindling breasts and luminous eyes
 She knew the Goddess, her she thus bespake.
 Ah whence, deceitful deity! thy wish
 Now to ensnare me? Wouldst thou lure me, say,
 To some fair city of M�onian name
 Or Phrygian, more remote from Sparta still?
 Hast thou some human favorite also there?
 Is it because Atrides hath prevailed
 To vanquish Paris, and would bear me home
 Unworthy as I am, that thou attempt'st
 Again to cheat me? Go thyself--sit thou
 Beside him--for his sake renounce the skies;
 Watch him, weep for him; till at length his wife
 He deign to make thee, or perchance his slave.
 I go not (now to go were shame indeed)
 To dress his couch; nor will I be the jest
 Of all my sex in Ilium. Oh! my griefs
 Are infinite, and more than I can bear.
 To whom, the foam-sprung Goddess, thus incensed.
 Ah wretch! provoke not me; lest in my wrath
 Abandoning thee, I not hate thee less
 Than now I fondly love thee, and beget
 Such detestation of thee in all hearts,
 Grecian and Trojan, that thou die abhorr'd.
 The Goddess ceased. Jove's daughter, Helen, fear'd,
 And, in her lucid veil close wrapt around,
 Silent retired, of all those Trojan dames
 Unseen, and Venus led, herself, the way.
 Soon then as Alexander's fair abode
 They reach'd, her maidens quick their tasks resumed,
 And she to her own chamber lofty-roof'd
 Ascended, loveliest of her sex. A seat
 For Helen, daughter of Jove �gis-arm'd,
 To Paris opposite, the Queen of smiles
 Herself disposed; but with averted eyes
 She sat before him, and him keen reproach'd.
 Thou hast escaped.--Ah would that thou hadst died
 By that heroic arm, mine husband's erst!
 Thou once didst vaunt thee in address and strength
 Superior. Go then--challenge yet again
 The warlike Menela�s forth in fight.
 But hold. The hero of the amber locks
 Provoke no more so rashly, lest the point
 Of his victorious spear soon stretch thee dead.
 She ended, to whom Paris thus replied.
 Ah Helen, wound me not with taunt severe!
 Me, Menela�s, by Minerva's aid,
 Hath vanquish'd now, who may hereafter, him.
 We also have our Gods. But let us love.
 For never since the day when thee I bore
 From pleasant Laced�mon o'er the waves
 To Cran�e's fair isle, and first enjoy'd
 Thy beauty, loved I as I love thee now,
 Or felt such sweetness of intense desire.
 He spake, and sought his bed, whom follow'd soon
 Jove's daughter, reconciled to his embrace.
 But Menela�s like a lion ranged
 The multitude, inquiring far and near
 For Paris lost. Yet neither Trojan him

 Nor friend of Troy could show, whom, else, through love
 None had conceal'd, for him as death itself
 All hated, but his going none had seen.
 Amidst them all then spake the King of men.
 Trojans, and Dardans, and allies of Troy!
 The warlike Menela�s hath prevailed,
 As is most plain. Now therefore bring ye forth
 Helen with all her treasures, also bring
 Such large amercement as is meet, a sum
 To be remember'd in all future times.
 So spake Atrides, and Achaia's host
 With loud applause confirm'd the monarch's claim.
