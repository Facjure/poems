 The knot was tied; the pair were wed,
 And then the smiling bridegroom said
 Unto the preacher, "Shall I pay
 To you the usual fee today.
 Or would you have me wait a year
 And give you then a hundred clear,
 If I should find the marriage state
 As happy as I estimate?"
 The preacher lost no time in thought,
 To his reply no study brought,
 There were no wrinkles on his brow:
 Said he, "I'll take three dollars now."
