 Dimple-cheeked and rosy-lipped,
 With his cap-rim backward tipped,
 Still in fancy I can see
 Little Tommy smile on me -
Little Tommy Smith.

 Little unsung Tommy Smith -
 Scarce a name to rhyme it with;
 Yet most tenderly to me
 Something sings unceasingly -
Little Tommy Smith.

 On the verge of some far land
 Still forever does he stand,
 With his cap-rim rakishly
 Tilted; so he smiles on me -
Little Tommy Smith.

 Elder-blooms contrast the grace
 Of the rover's radiant face -
 Whistling back, in mimicry,
 "Old - Bob - White!" all liquidly -
Little Tommy Smith.

 O my jaunty statuette
 Of first love, I see you yet.
 Though you smile so mistily,
 It is but through tears I see,
Little Tommy Smith.

 But, with crown tipped back behind,
 And the glad hand of the wind
 Smoothing back your hair, I see
 Heaven's best angel smile on me, -
Little Tommy Smith.
