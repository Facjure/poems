title: Song: Let Us Go Back
---

Let us go back together to the hills.
Weary am I of palaces and courts,
Weary of words disloyal to my thoughts,, 
Come, my beloved, let us to the hills.

Let us go back together to the land,
And wander hand in hand upon the heights;
Kings have we seen, and manifold delights,, 
Oh, my beloved, let us to the land!

Lone and unshackled, let us to the road
Which holds enchantment round each hidden bend,
Our course uncompassed and our whim its end,
Our feet once more, beloved, to the road!
