"To arms!" the battle bugles blew.
 The daughter of their Earl was she,
Lord of a thousand swords and true;
 He but a squire of low degree.

The horns of war blew up to horse:
 He kissed her mouth; her face was white;
"God grant they bear thee back no corse!" - 
 "God give I win my spurs to-night!"

Each watch-tower's blazing beacon scarred
 A blood-blot in the wounded dark:
She heard knights gallop battleward,
 And from the turret leaned to mark.

"My God, deliver me and mine!
 My child! my God!" all night she prayed:
She saw the battle beacons shine;
 She saw the battle beacons fade.

They brought him on a bier of spears. - 
 For him - the death-won spurs and name;
For her - the sting of secret tears,
 And convent walls to hide her shame.
