I.

Broken!
It's only a ring - a plain, old ring,
Worn down to a thread almost - 
Fling it away - the useless thing!
What value now can it boast? - 
Fling it away!
Yet stay! - oh stay
Ere you cast it away!
There's a tale of the vanished years
That ever will cling,
To that broken ring,
That hallows and endears - 
Oh stay!
In vain! - in vain! - What matters it now
That tenderest memories cling
To that thread of gold so wasted and old - 
Who cares for a broken ring? - 
Fling it away!


II.

Broken!
It's only a vase - an old, stone vase - 
Ancient and out of style - 
That has stood for years in the chimney place,
Provoking many a smile - 
Throw it away!
Yet stay! - that vase
Held honored place
In the sight of prince and peer
And the flowers it held
Were gathered of old
By the lovely and the dear! - 
Oh stay!
In vain! - In vain! - What matters it now
How honored was once its place!
It is broken, and old, and the hearts are cold
That cherished the old stone vase - 
Throw it away!


III.

Broken!
It's only a promise - as light as air - 
Though earnestly, solemnly given,
Made to be broken - yet who should care? - 
Do you think it was heard in Heaven? - 
Break it to day!
Yet stay! - that breath
Is a blast of death
To an innocent human heart!
Unsay the word,
For God has heard!
And He taketh the wronged one's part - -
Break it not to-day!
In vain! - in vain! - What matters it now?
It was only a breath - no more!
A faithless promise - a traitor's vow - 
Such things have happened before - 
It's broken to-day!


IV.

Broken!
It's only a heart - a human heart - 
That has throbbed for years and years,
With the burning pain and the cruel smart
Whose agony knows no tears - 
Cast it away'
Yet stay! - oh stay!
A father, grey
And sorrowful, prayed for her long
And a mother's love
Bore to God above
The tale of her poor childs wrong! - 
Cast it not away!
In vain! - 'Tis a story old and worn - 
This story of falsehood's art - 
Of the harsh world's withering blight and scorn, - 
Who cares for the broken heart
That's been cast away?
