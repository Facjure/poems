title: Song of the Cattle-Hunters
---

While the morning light beams on the fern-matted streams,
And the water-pools flash in its glow,
Down the ridges we fly, with a loud ringing cry
Down the ridges and gullies we go!
And the cattle we hunt they are racing in front,
With a roar like the thunder of waves,
As the beat and the beat of our swift horses� feet
Start the echoes away from their caves!
As the beat and the beat
Of our swift horses� feet
Start the echoes away from their caves!

Like a wintry shore that the waters ride o�er,
All the lowlands are filling with sound;
For swiftly we gain where the herds on the plain,
Like a tempest, are tearing the ground!
And we�ll follow them hard to the rails of the yard,
O�er the gulches and mountain-tops grey,
Where the beat and the beat of our swift horses� feet
Will die with the echoes away!
Where the beat and the beat
Of our swift horses� feet
Will die with the echoes away!
