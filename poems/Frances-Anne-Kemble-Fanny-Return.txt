When the bright sun back on his yearly road
 Comes towards us, his great glory seems to me,
As from the sky he pours it all abroad,
 A golden herald, my beloved, of thee.

When from the south the gentle winds do blow,
 Calling the flowers that sleep beneath the earth,
It sounds like sweetest music, that doth go
 Before thy coming, full of love and mirth.

When one by one the violets appear,
 Opening their purple vests so modestly,
To greet the virgin daughter of the year,
 Each seems a fragrant prophecy of thee.

For with the spring thou shalt return again;
 Therefore the wind, the flower, and clear sunshine,
A double worship from my heart obtain,
 A love and welcome not their own, but thine.
