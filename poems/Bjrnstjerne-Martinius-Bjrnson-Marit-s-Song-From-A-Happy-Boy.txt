"Dance!" called the fiddle,
 Its strings loudly giggled,
 The bailiff's man wriggled
 Ahead for a spree.
"Hold!" shouted Ola
 And tripped him to tumbling,
 The bailiff's man humbling,
 To maidens' great glee.

"Hop!" said then Erik,
 His foot struck the ceiling,
 The beams rang their pealing,
 The walls gave a shriek.
"Stop!" said now Elling,
 And seizing him collared,
 He held him and hollered:
"You still are too weak!"

"Hei!" said then Rasmus,
 Fair Randi embracing:
 "Be quick now in placing
 The kiss that you know!"

"Nay!" answered Randi.
 A slapping she gave him,
 And from her she drave him:
"Here take what I owe!"
