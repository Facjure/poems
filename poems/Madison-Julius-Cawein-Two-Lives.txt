"There is no God," one said,
And love is lust;
When I am dead I'm dead,
And all is dust.

"Be merry while you can
Before you're gray;
With some wild courtesan
Drink care away."

One said, "A God there is,
And God is love;
Death is not death, but bliss,
And life above.

"Above all flesh is mind;
And faith and truth
God's gifts to poor mankind
That make life youth."

One from a harlot's side
 Arose at morn;
One cursing God had died
 That night forlorn.
