Though Summer walks the world to-day
 With corn-crowned hours for her guard,
Her thoughts have clad themselves in gray,
 And wait in Autumn's weedy yard.

And where the larkspur and the phlox
 Spread carpets wheresoe'er she pass,
She seems to stand with sombre locks
 Bound bleak with fog-washed zinnias. - 

Fall's terra-cotta-colored flowers,
 Whose disks the trickling wet has tinged
With dingy lustre when the bower's
 Thin, flame-flecked leaves the frost has singed;

Or with slow feet, 'mid gaunt gold blooms
 Of marigolds her fingers twist,
She seems to pass with Fall's perfumes,
 And dreams of sullen rain and mist.
