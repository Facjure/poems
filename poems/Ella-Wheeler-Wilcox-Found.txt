Found - as I rushed through the great world's mart,
 In a race for gold and a pleasure quest,
A passionate, throbbing human heart
 Suddenly found in my breast.

I had always laughed at the foolish word;
 I had said aloud in my boasting glee,
That never a heart in my bosom stirred,
 That my brain governed me.

I was proud with the sense of my might and power
 'It is will, not heart that wins,' I said.
But I suddenly found one sad, strange hour
 That the strength of my will had fled.

For up in my breast there rose supreme
 A strong man's heart, and all on fire:
Drunk with the wine of a wild, sweet dream,
 And tortured with desire.

It is tossed with hope, and fear, and doubt,
 It is mad with the fever of love's unrest,
I wish to God I could pluck it out -
 This heart I found in my breast.
