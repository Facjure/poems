 I go through wet spring woods alone,
 Through sweet green woods with heart of stone,
 My weary foot upon the grass
 Falls heavy as I pass.
 The cuckoo from the distance cries,
 The lark a pilgrim in the skies;
 But all the pleasant spring is drear.
 I want you, dear!

 I pass the summer meadows by,
 The autumn poppies bloom and die;
 I speak alone so bitterly
 For no voice answers me.
 �O lovers parting by the gate,
 O robin singing to your mate,
 Plead you well, for she will hear
 �I love you, dear!��

 I crouch alone, unsatisfied,
 Mourning by winter�s fireside.
 O Fate, what evil wind you blow.
 Must this be so?
 No southern breezes come to bless,
 So conscious of their emptiness
 My lonely arms I spread in woe,
 I want you so.
