title: A Spring Song And A Later
---

She sang a song of May for me,
 Wherein once more I heard
The mirth of my glad infancy -
 The orchard's earliest bird -
The joyous breeze among the trees
 New-clad in leaf and bloom,
And there the happy honey-bees
 In dewy gleam and gloom.

So purely, sweetly on the sense
 Of heart and spirit fell
Her song of Spring, its influence -
 Still irresistible, -
Commands me here - with eyes ablur -
 To mate her bright refrain.
Though I but shed a rhyme for her
 As dim as Autumn rain.
