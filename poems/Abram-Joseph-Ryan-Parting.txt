Farewell! that word has broken hearts
 And blinded eyes with tears;
Farewell! one stays, and one departs;
 Between them roll the years.

No wonder why who say it think --
 Farewell! he may fare ill
No wonder that their spirits sink
 And all their hopes grow chill.

Good-bye! that word makes faces pale
 And fills the soul with fears;
Good-bye! two words that wing a wail
 Which flutters down the years.

No wonder they who say it feel
 Such pangs for those who go;
Good-bye they wish the parted weal,
 But ah! they may meet woe.

Adieu! such is the word for us,
 'Tis more than word -- 'tis prayer;
They do not part, who do part thus,
 For God is everywhere.
