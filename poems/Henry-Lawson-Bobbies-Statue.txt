title: Bobbie�s Statue
---

Grown tired of mourning for my sins,
And brooding over merits,
The other night with aching heart
I went amongst the spirits;
And I met one that I knew well:
�O Scotty�s Ghost! is that you?
And did you see the fearsome crowd
At Bobbie Burns�s statue?

�They hurried up in hansom cabs,
Tall-hatted and frock-coated;
They trained it in from all the towns,
The weird and hairy-throated;
They spoke in some outlandish tongue,
They cut some comic capers,
And ilka man was wild to get
His name in all the papers.

�They showed no sign of intellect,
Those frauds who rushed before us;
They knew one verse of �Auld Lang Syne�,
The first one and the chorus.
They clacked the clack o� Scotlan��s Bard,
They glibly talked of �Rabby�;
But what if he had come to them
Without a groat and shabby?

�They drank and wept for Rabbie�s sake,
They stood and brayed like asses
(The living bard�s a drunken rake,
The dead one loved the lasses);
If Bobbie Burns were here, they�d sit
As still as any mouse is;
If Bobbie Bums should come their way,
They�d turn him out their houses.

�O weep for bonny Scotland�s Bard!
And praise the Scottish nation,
Who made him spy and let him die
Heart-broken in privation:
Exciseman, so that he might live
Through northern winters� rigours,
Just as in southern lands they give
The hard-up rhymer figures.

�We need some songs of stinging fun
To wake the States and light �em;
I wish a man like Robert Burns
Were here to-day to write �em!
But still the mockery shall survive
Till Day o� Judgement crashes,
The men we scorn when we�re alive
With praise insult our ashes.�

And Scotty�s Ghost said: �Never mind
The fleas that you inherit;
The living bard can flick �em off,
They cannot hurt his spirit.
The crawlers round the poet�s name
Shall crawl through all the ages;
His work�s the living thing, and they
Are fly-dirt on the pages.�
