 We've finished up the filthy war;
 We've won what we were fighting for . . .
 (Or have we? I don't know).
 But anyway I have my wish:
 I'm back upon the old Boul' Mich',
 And how my heart's aglow!
 Though in my coat's an empty sleeve,
 Ah! do not think I ever grieve
 (The pension for it, I believe,
 Will keep me on the go).

 So I'll be free to write and write,
 And give my soul to sheer delight,
 Till joy is almost pain;
 To stand aloof and watch the throng,
 And worship youth and sing my song
 Of faith and hope again;
 To seek for beauty everywhere,
 To make each day a living prayer
 That life may not be vain.

 To sing of things that comfort me,
 The joy in mother-eyes, the glee
 Of little ones at play;
 The blessed gentleness of trees,
 Of old men dreaming at their ease
 Soft afternoons away;
 Of violets and swallows' wings,
 Of wondrous, ordinary things
 In words of every day.

 To rhyme of rich and rainy nights,
 When like a legion leap the lights
 And take the town with gold;
 Of taverns quaint where poets dream,
 Of cafes gaudily agleam,
 And vice that's overbold;
 Of crystal shimmer, silver sheen,
 Of soft and soothing nicotine,
 Of wine that's rich and old,

 Of gutters, chimney-tops and stars,
 Of apple-carts and motor-cars,
 The sordid and sublime;
 Of wealth and misery that meet
 In every great and little street,
 Of glory and of grime;
 Of all the living tide that flows - 
 From princes down to puppet shows - 
 I'll make my humble rhyme.

 So if you like the sort of thing
 Of which I also like to sing,
 Just give my stuff a look;
 And if you don't, no harm is done - 

 In writing it I've had my fun;
 Good luck to you and every one - 
 And so
 Here ends my book.
