title: Amarillis I Did Woo
---

Amarillis I did woo,
And I courted Phillis too;
Daphne, for her love, I chose;
Cloris, for that damask rose
In her cheek, I held as dear;
Yea, a thousand liked well near.
And, in love with all together,
Fearï¿½d the enjoying either;
'Cause to be of one possest,
Barred the hope of all the rest.
