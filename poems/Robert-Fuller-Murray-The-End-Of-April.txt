This is the time when larks are singing loud
 And higher still ascending and more high,
This is the time when many a fleecy cloud
 Runs lamb-like on the pastures of the sky,
This is the time when most I love to lie
 Stretched on the links, now listening to the sea,
Now looking at the train that dawdles by;
 But James is going in for his degree.

James is my brother.He has twice been ploughed,
 Yet he intends to have another shy,
Hoping to pass (as he says) in a crowd.
 Sanguine is James, but not so sanguine I.
 If you demand my reason, I reply:
 Because he reads no Greek without a key
And spells Thucydides c-i-d-y;
 Yet James is going in for his degree.

No doubt, if the authorities allowed
 The taking in of Bohns, he might defy
The stiffest paper that has ever cowed
 A timid candidate and made him fly.
Without such aids, he all as well may try
 To cultivate the people of Dundee,
Or lead the camel through the needle's eye;
 Yet James is going in for his degree.

Vain are the efforts hapless mortals ply
 To climb of knowledge the forbidden tree;
Yet still about its roots they strive and cry,
 And James is going in for his degree.
