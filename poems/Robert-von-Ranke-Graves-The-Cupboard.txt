Mother

 What's in that cupboard, Mary?

Mary

 Which cupboard, mother dear?

Mother

 The cupboard of red mahogany
 With handles shining clear.

Mary

 That cupboard, dearest mother,
 With shining crystal handles?
 There's nought inside but rags and jags
 And yellow tallow candles.

Mother

 What's in that cupboard, Mary?

Mary

 Which cupboard, mother mine?

Mother

 That cupboard stands in your sunny chamber,
 The silver corners shine.

Mary

 There's nothing there inside, mother,
 But wool and thread and flax,
 And bits of faded silk and velvet,
 And candles of white wax.

Mother

 What's in that cupboard, Mary?
 And this time tell me true.

Mary

 White clothes for an unborn baby, mother,
 But what's the truth to you?
