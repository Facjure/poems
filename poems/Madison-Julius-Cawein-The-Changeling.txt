I

There were Fa�ries two or three,
 And a high moon white as wool,
Or a bloom in Fa�ry,
Where the star-thick blossoms be
 Star-like beautiful.


II

There were Fa�ries two or three,
 And a wind as fragrant as
Spicy wafts from Arcady
Rocked the sleeping honey bee
 In the clover grass.


III

There were Fa�ries two or three,
 Wee white caps and red wee shoon,
Buckles at each dainty knee,
"We are come to comfort thee,
 With the silver moon."


IV

There were Fa�ries two or three,
 Buttercups brimmed up with dew,
Winning faces sweet to see,
Then mine eyes closed heavily:
 "Fa�ries, what would you?"


V

There were Fa�ries two or three,
 And my babe was dreaming deep,
White as whitest ivory,
In its crib of ebony
 Rocked and crooned on sleep.


VI

There were Fa�ries two or three
 Standing in the mocking moon,
And mine eyes closed drowsily,
Drowsily and suddenly
 There my babe was gone.


VII

Now no Fa�ries two or three
 Loitered in the moon alone;
Jesu, Marie, comfort me!
What is this instead I see - 
 Ugly skin and bone.


VIII

There were Fa�ries two or three
 Stood with buckles on red shoon,
But with evil sorcery
My sweet babe to Fa�ry
 They did steal right soon.
