Ants colonized it
 -huge abodes littered with the dead
(leaves, sticks, the occasional granulated insect
piled high, totemic-fashion)
reaping a fortune in scenery,
though probably not food Ojibways were next- 
their tell-tale encampment by
pocket-sized waterfall,
inlets off a winding cataract
&amp; moss, loam-thick with black soil
a future arboreal dream
inching over rock, darling crevice
for northern orchid, then kiss
of red death the hybrid trillium
&amp; more sinister cousin,
jack-in-the-pulpit
for Indian foragers.

Animistic limestone shone hands,
poked thru the forest with stealth,
petroglyphic lava beds
 -a cougar pouncing- 
runic carvings the cold in the
Giant's stone nostrils billowing
off the lake like a presence.
