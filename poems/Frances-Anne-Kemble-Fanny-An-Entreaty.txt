Once more, once more into the sunny fields
 Oh, let me stray!
And drink the joy that young existence yields
 In a bright, cloudless day.

Once more let me behold the summer sky,
 With its blue eyes,
And join the wild wind's voice of melody,
 As far and free it flies.

Once more, once more, oh let me stand and hear
 The gushing spring,
As its bright drops fall starlike, fast and clear,
 And in the sunshine sing.

Once more, oh let me list the soft sweet breeze
 At evening mourn:
Let me, oh let me say farewell to these,
 And to my task I gaily will return.

Oh, lovely earth! oh, blessed smiling sky!
 Oh, music of the wood, the wave, the wind!
I do but linger till my ear and eye
 Have traced ye on the tablets of my mind - 

And then, fare ye well!
Bright hill and bosky dell,
Clear spring and haunted well,
Night-blowing flowers pale,
Smooth lawn and lonely vale,
Sleeping lakes and sparkling fountains,
Shadowy woods and sheltering mountains,
Flowery land and sunny sky,
And echo sweet, my playmate shy;
 Fare ye well! - fare ye well!
