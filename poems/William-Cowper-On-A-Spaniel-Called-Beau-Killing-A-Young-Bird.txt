title: On A Spaniel, Called Beau, Killing A Young Bird.
---

A Spaniel, Beau, that fares like you,
Well fed, and at his ease,
Should wiser be than to pursue
Each trifle that he sees.


But you have killï¿½d a tiny bird,
Which flew not till to-day,
Against my orders, whom you heard
Forbidding you the prey.


Nor did you kill that you might eat
And ease a doggish pain,
For him, though chased with furious heat,
You left where he was slain.


Nor was he of the thievish sort,
Or one whom blood allures,
But innocent was all his sport
Whom you have torn for yours.


My dog! what remedy remains,
Since teach you all I can,
I see you, after all my pains,
So much resemble man?
