I

Earth was not: nor globes of attraction
The will of the Immortal expanded
Or contracted his all flexible senses.
Death was not, but eternal life sprung

II

The sound of a trumpet the heavens
Awoke &amp; vast clouds of blood roll'd
Round the dim rocks of Urizen, so nam'd
That solitary one in Immensity

III

Shrill the trumpet: &amp; myriads of Eternity,
Muster around the bleak desarts
Now fill'd with clouds, darkness &amp; waters
That roll'd perplex'd labring &amp; utter'd
Words articulate, bursting in thunders
That roll'd on the tops of his mountains

IV

From the depths of dark solitude. From
The eternal abode in my holiness,
Hidden set apart in my stern counsels
Reserv'd for the days of futurity,
I have sought for a joy without pain,
For a solid without fluctuation
Why will you die O Eternals?
Why live in unquenchable burnings?

V

First I fought with the fire; consum'd
Inwards, into a deep world within:
A void immense, wild dark &amp; deep,
Where nothing was: Natures wide womb
And self balanc'd stretch'd o'er the void
I alone, even I! the winds merciless
Bound; but condensing, in torrents
They fall &amp; fall; strong I repell'd
The vast waves, &amp; arose on the waters
A wide world of solid obstruction

VI

Here alone I in books formd of metals
Have written the secrets of wisdom
The secrets of dark contemplation
By fightings and conflicts dire,
With terrible monsters Sin-bred:
Which the bosoms of all inhabit;
Seven deadly Sins of the soul.

VII

Lo! I unfold my darkness: and on
This rock, place with strong hand the Book
Of eternal brass, written in my solitude.

VIII

Laws of peace, of love, of unity:
Of pity, compassion, forgiveness.
Let each chuse one habitation:
His ancient infinite mansion:
One command, one joy, one desire,
One curse, one weight, one measure
One King, one God, one Law.
