I met Bear at the 5 n' dime
sipping a Cream Soda
he was voluble &amp;
needed to talk...
"I got a shit-load on my mind,"
mumbling something about some
run-in with a Mountie - tampering
with Crown Evidence, the purloined Honey Jar,
in question, Jimmy Dean was there, too,
polishing his coolness though he would
have his own Run-In later in the evening.
As Marilyn had left,
I decided to forgo Bear's company,
still slurping his Soda &amp;
crying into the bubbles,
some things never change.
