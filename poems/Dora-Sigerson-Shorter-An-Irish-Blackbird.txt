 This is my brave singer,
With his beak of gold;
 Now my heart�s a captive
In his song�s sweet hold.

 O, the lark�s a rover,
Seeking fields above:
 But my serenader
Hath a human love.

 �Hark!� he says, �in winter
Nests are full of snow,
 But a truce to wailing
Summer breezes blow.�

 �Hush!� he sings, �with night-time
Phantoms cease to be,
 Join your serenader
Piping on his tree.�

 O, my little lover,
Warble in the blue;
 Wingless must I envy
Skies so wide for you.
