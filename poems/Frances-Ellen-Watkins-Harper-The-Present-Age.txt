title: The Present Age.
---

 Say not the age is hard and cold -
 I think it brave and grand;
 When men of diverse sects and creeds
 Are clasping hand in hand.

 The Parsee from his sacred fires
 Beside the Christian kneels;
 And clearer light to Islam's eyes
 The word of Christ reveals.

 The Brahmin from his distant home
 Brings thoughts of ancient lore;
 The Bhuddist breaking bonds of caste
 Divides mankind no more.

 The meek-eyed sons of far Cathay
 Are welcome round the board;
 Not greed, nor malice drives away
 These children of our Lord.

 And Judah from whose trusted hands
 Came oracles divine;
 Now sits with those around whose hearts
 The light of God doth shine.


 Japan unbars her long sealed gates
 From islands far away;
 Her sons are lifting up their eyes
 To greet the coming day.

 The Indian child from forests wild
 Has learned to read and pray;
 The tomahawk and scalping knife
 From him have passed away.

 From centuries of servile toil
 The Negro finds release,
 And builds the fanes of prayer and praise
 Unto the God of Peace.

 England and Russia face to face
 With Central Asia meet;
 And on the far Pacific coast,
 Chinese and natives greet.

 Crusaders once with sword and shield
 The Holy Land to save;
 From Moslem hands did strive to clutch
 The dear Redeemer's grave.

 A battle greater, grander far
 Is for the present age;
 A crusade for the rights of man
 To brighten history's page.

 Where labor faints and bows her head,
 And want consorts with crime;
 Or men grown faithless sadly say
 That evil is the time.

 There is the field, the vantage ground
 For every earnest heart;
 To side with justice, truth and right
 And act a noble part.

 To save from ignorance and vice
 The poorest, humblest child;
 To make our age the fairest one
 On which the sun has smiled;

 To plant the roots of coming years
 In mercy, love and truth;
 And bid our weary, saddened earth
 Again renew her youth.

 Oh! earnest hearts! toil on in hope,
 'Till darkness shrinks from light;
 To fill the earth with peace and joy,
 Let youth and age unite:


 To stay the floods of sin and shame
 That sweep from shore to shore;
 And furl the banners stained with blood,
 'Till war shall be no more.

 Blame not the age, nor think it full
 Of evil and unrest;
 But say of every other age,
 "This one shall be the best."

 The age to brighten every path
 By sin and sorrow trod;
 For loving hearts to usher in
 The commonwealth of God.
