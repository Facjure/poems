 I wrote the truest, tend'rest song
 The world had ever heard;
 And clear, melodious, and strong,
 And sweet was every word.
 The flowing numbers came to me
 Unbidden from the heart;
 So pure the strain, that poesy
 Seemed something more than art.

 No doubtful cadence marred a line,
 So tunefully it flowed,
 And through the measure, all divine
 The fire of genius glowed.
 So deftly were the verses wrought,
 So fair the legend told,
 That every word revealed a thought,
 And every thought was gold.

 Mine was the charm, the power, the skill,
 The wisdom of the years;
 'Twas mine to move the world at will
 To laughter or to tears.
 For subtile pleasantry was there,
 And brilliant flash of wit;
 Now, pleading eyes were raised in prayer,
 And now with smiles were lit.

 I sang of hours when youth was king,
 And of one happy spot
 Where life and love were everything,
 And time was half forgot.
 Of gracious days in woodland ways,
 When every flower and tree
 Seemed echoing the sweetest phrase
 From lips in Arcadie.

 Of sagas old and Norseman bands
 That sailed o'er northern seas;
 Enchanting tales of fairy lands
 And strange philosophies.
 I sang of Egypt's fairest queen,
 With passion's fatal curse;
 Of that pale, sad-faced Florentine,
 As deathless as his verse.

 Of time of the Arcadian Pan,
 When dryads thronged the trees - 
 When Atalanta swiftly ran
 With fleet Hippomenes.
 Brave stories, too, did I relate
 Of battle-flags unfurled;
 Of glorious days when Greece was great - 
 When Rome was all the world!

 Of noble deeds for noble creeds,
 Of woman's sacrifice - 
 The mother's stricken heart that bleeds
 For souls in Paradise.
 Anon I told a tale of shame,
 And while in tears I slept,
 Behold! a white-robed angel came
 And read the words and wept!

 And so I wrote my perfect song,
 In such a wondrous key,
 I heard the plaudits of the throng,
 And fame awaited me.
 Alas! the sullen morning broke,
 And came the tempest's roar:
 'Mid discord trembling I awoke,
 And lo! my dream was o'er!

 Yet often in the quiet night
 My song returns to me;
 I seize the pen, and fain would write
 My long lost melody.
 But dreaming o'er the words, ere long
 Comes vague remembering,
 And fades away the sweetest song
 That man can ever sing!
