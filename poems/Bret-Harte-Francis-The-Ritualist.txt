He wore, I think, a chasuble, the day when first we met;
A stole and snowy alb likewise, I recollect it yet.
He called me �daughter,� as he raised his jeweled hand to bless;
And then, in thrilling undertones, he asked, �Would I confess?�

O mother dear! blame not your child, if then on bended knees
I dropped, and thought of Abelard, and also Eloise;
Or when, beside the altar high, he bowed before the pyx,
I envied that seraphic kiss he gave the crucifix.

The cruel world may think it wrong, perhaps may deem me weak,
And, speaking of that sainted man, may call his conduct �cheek;�
And, like that wicked barrister whom Cousin Harry quotes,
May term his mixed chalice �grog,� his vestments �petticoats;�

But, whatsoe�er they do or say, I�ll build a Christian�s hope
On incense and on altar-lights, on chasuble and cope.
Let others prove, by precedent, the faith that they profess:
�His can�t be wrong� that�s symbolized by such becoming dress.
