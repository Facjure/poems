Oh, you�re the girl lives on the corner? Come in if you want to come quick!
There�s no one but me in the house, and the cook but she�s only a stick.
Don�t try the front way, but come over the fence through the window that�s how.
Don�t mind the big dog he won�t bite you just see him obey me! there, now!

What�s your name? Mary Ellen? How funny! Mine�s Edith it�s nicer, you see;
But yours does for you, for you�re plainer, though maybe you�re gooder than me;
For Jack says I�m sometimes a devil, but Jack, of all folks, needn�t talk,
For I don�t call the seamstress an angel till Ma says the poor thing must �walk.�

Come in! It�s quite dark in the parlor, for sister will keep the blinds down,
For you know her complexion is sallow like yours, but she isn�t as brown;
Though Jack says that isn�t the reason she likes to sit here with Jim Moore.
Do you think that he meant that she kissed him? Would you if your lips wasn�t sore?

If you like, you can try our piano. �Tain�t ours. A man left it here
To rent by the month, although Ma says he hasn�t been paid for a year.
Sister plays oh, such fine variations! why, I once heard a gentleman say
That she didn�t mind that for the music in fact, it was just in her way!

Ain�t I funny? And yet it�s the queerest of all that, whatever I say,
One half of the folks die a-laughing, and the rest, they all look t�other way.
And some say, �That child!� Do they ever say that to such people as you?
Though maybe you�re naturally silly, and that makes your eyes so askew.

Now stop don�t you dare to be crying! Just as sure as you live, if you do,
I�ll call in my big dog to bite you, and I�ll make my Papa kill you, too!
And then where�ll you be? So play pretty. There�s my doll, and a nice piece of cake.
You don�t want it you think it is poison! Then I�ll eat it, dear, just for your sake!
