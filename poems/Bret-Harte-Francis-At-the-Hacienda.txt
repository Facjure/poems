Know I not whom thou mayst be
Carved upon this olive-tree,
�Manuela of La Torre,�
For around on broken walls
Summer sun and spring rain falls,
And in vain the low wind calls
�Manuela of La Torre.�

Of that song no words remain
But the musical refrain,
�Manuela of La Torre.�
Yet at night, when winds are still,
Tinkles on the distant hill
A guitar, and words that thrill
Tell to me the old, old story,
Old when first thy charms were sung,
Old when these old walls were young,
�Manuela of La Torre.�
