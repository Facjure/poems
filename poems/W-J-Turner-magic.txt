I love a still conservatory
 That's full of giant, breathless palms,
Azaleas, clematis and vines,
 Whose quietness great Trees becalms
Filling the air with foliage,
 A curved and dreamy statuary.

I like to hear a cold, pure rill
 Of water trickling low, afar
With sudden little jerks and purls
 Into a tank or stoneware jar,
The song of a tiny sleeping bird
 Held like a shadow in its trill.

I love the mossy quietness
 That grows upon the great stone flags,
The dark tree-ferns, the staghorn ferns,
 The prehistoric, antlered stags
That carven stand and stare among
 The silent, ferny wilderness.

And are they birds or souls that flit
 Among the trees so silently,
And are they fish or ghosts that haunt
 The still pools of the rockery! -
For I am but a sculptured rock
 As in that magic place I sit.

Still as a great jewel is the air
 With boughs and leaves smooth-carved in it,
And rocks and trees and giant ferns,
 And blooms with inner radiance lit,
And naked water like a nymph
 That dances tireless slim and bare.

I watch a white Nyanza float
 Upon a green, untroubled pool,
A fairyland Ophelia, she
 Has cast herself in water cool,
And lies while fairy cymbals ring
 Drowned in her fairy castle moat.

The goldfish sing a winding song
 Below her pale and waxen face,
The water-nymph is dancing by
 Lifting smooth arms with mournful grace,
A stainless white dream she floats on
 While fairies beat a fairy gong.

Silent the Cattleyas blaze
 And thin red orchid shapes of Death
Peer savagely with twisted lips
 Sucking an eerie, phantom breath
With that bright, spotted, fever'd lust
 That watches lonely travellers craze.

Gigantic, mauve and hairy leaves
 Hang like obliterated faces
Full of dim unattained expression
 Such as haunts virgin forest places
When Silence leaps among the trees
 And the echoing heart deceives.
