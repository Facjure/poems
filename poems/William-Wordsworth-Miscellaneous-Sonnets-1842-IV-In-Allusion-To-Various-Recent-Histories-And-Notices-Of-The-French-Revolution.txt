 Portentous change when History can appear
 As the cool Advocate of foul device;
 Reckless audacity extol, and jeer
 At consciences perplexed with scruples nice!
 They who bewail not, must abhor, the sneer
 Born of Conceit, Power's blind Idolater;
 Or haply sprung from vaunting Cowardice
 Betrayed by mockery of holy fear.
 Hath it not long been said the wrath of Man
 Works not the righteousness of God? Oh bend,
 Bend, ye Perverse! to judgments from on High,
 Laws that lay under Heaven's perpetual ban
 All principles of action that transcend
 The sacred limits of humanity.
