 Yes, yes! I love thee, Guilo; thee alone.
 Why dost thou sigh, and wear that face of sorrow?
 The sunshine is to-day's, although it shone
 On yesterday, and may shine on to-morrow.

 I love but thee, my Guilo! be content;
 The greediest heart can claim but present pleasure.
 The future is thy God's. The past is spent.
 To-day is thine; clasp close the precious treasure.

 See how I love thee, Guilo! Lips and eyes
 Could never under thy fond gaze dissemble.
 I could not feign these passion-laden sighs;
 Deceiving thee, my pulses would not tremble.

 "So I loved Romney." Hush, thou foolish one - 
 I should forget him wholly wouldst thou let me;
 Or but remember that his day was done
 From that supremest hour when first I met thee.

 "And Paul?" Well, what of Paul? Paul had blue eyes,
 And Romney gray, and thine are darkly tender!
 One finds fresh feelings under change of skies - 
 A new horizon brings a newer splendor.

 As I love thee I never loved before;
 Believe me, Guilo, for I speak most truly.
 What though to Romney and to Paul I swore
 The self-same words; my heart now worships newly.

 We never feel the same emotion twice:
 No two ships ever ploughed the self-same billow;
 The waters change with every fall and rise;
 So, Guilo, go contented to thy pillow.
