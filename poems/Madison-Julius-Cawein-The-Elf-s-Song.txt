 I.

Where thronged poppies with globed shields
 Of fierce red
Warrior all the harvest fields
 Is my bed.
Here I tumble with the bee,
Robber bee of low degree
 Gay with dust:
Wit ye of a bracelet bold
Broadly belting him with gold?
It was I who bound it on
When a-gambol on the lawn - 
 It can never rust.


 II.

Where the glow-worm lights his lamp
 There am I;
Where within the grasses damp
 Crickets cry.
Cheer'ly, cheer'ly in the burne
Where the lins the torrents churn
 Into foam,
Leap I on a whisp of broom, - 
Cheer'ly, cheer'ly through the gloom, - 
All aneath a round-cheeked moon,
Treading on her silver shoon
 Lightly o'er the gloam,


 III.

Or the cowslip on the bent
 Lift her head,
Or the glow-worm's lamp be spent,
 Whitely dead:
'Neath lank ferns I laughing lie,
'Neath the ferns full warily
 Hid away,
Where the drowsy musk-rose blows
And a fussy runnel flows,
Sleeping with the Faï¿½ry
Under leafy canopy
 All the holyday.
