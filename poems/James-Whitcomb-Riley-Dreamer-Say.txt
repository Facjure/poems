Dreamer, say, will you dream for me
 A wild sweet dream of a foreign land,
Whose border sips of a foaming sea
 With lips of coral and silver sand;
Where warm winds loll on the shady deeps,
 Or lave themselves in the tearful mist
The great wild wave of the breaker weeps
 O'er crags of opal and amethyst?

Dreamer, say, will you dream a dream
 Of tropic shades in the lands of shine,
Where the lily leans o'er an amber stream
 That flows like a rill of wasted wine, -
Where the palm-trees, lifting their shields of green,
 Parry the shafts of the Indian sun
Whose splintering vengeance falls between
 The reeds below where the waters run?

Dreamer, say, will you dream of love
 That lives in a land of sweet perfume,
Where the stars drip down from the skies above
 In molten spatters of bud and bloom?
Where never the weary eyes are wet,
 And never a sob in the balmy air,
And only the laugh of the paroquette
 Breaks the sleep of the silence there?
