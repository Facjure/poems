 O partial MEMORY! Years, that fled too fast,
From thee in more than pristine beauty rise,
Forgotten all the transient tears and sighs
Somewhat that dimm'd their brightness! Thou hast chas'd
 Each hovering mist from the soft Suns, that grac'd
Our fresh, gay morn of Youth; - the Heart's high prize,
Friendship, - and all that charm'd us in the eyes
Of yet unutter'd Love. - So pleasures past,
 That in thy crystal prism thus glow sublime,
Beam on the gloom'd and disappointed Mind
When Youth and Health, in the chill'd grasp of Time,
 Shudder and fade; - and cypress buds we find
Ordain'd Life's blighted roses to supply,
While but reflected shine the golden lights of Joy.
