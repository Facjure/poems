 In her dark eyes dreams poetize;
 The soul sits lost in love:
 There is no thing in all the skies,
 To gladden all the world I prize,
 Like the deep love in her dark eyes,
 Or one sweet dream thereof.

 In her dark eyes, where thoughts arise,
 Her soul's soft moods I see:
 Of hope and faith, that make life wise;
 And charity, whose food is sighs 
 Not truer than her own true eyes
 Is truth's divinity.

 In her dark eyes the knowledge lies
 Of an immortal sod,
 Her soul once trod in angel-guise,
 Nor can forget its heavenly ties,
 Since, there in Heaven, upon her eyes
 Once gazed the eyes of God.
