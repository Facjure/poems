---

The folds of the sea crash like whips on my skin.
And the stars of the sea tear me apart.
The evening of the sea is one of screaming wounds for the lonely,
But lovers find the good death of their day dreams...
Be there soon, you with pain in your eye, the sea hurts.
Be there soon, you who suffer in love, the sea is killing me.
Your hands are cool saints.Cover me with them,
The sea is burning on me.
But why don't you help me!But help!...Cover me.Save me.
Cure me, friend and woman.
Mother... you -
