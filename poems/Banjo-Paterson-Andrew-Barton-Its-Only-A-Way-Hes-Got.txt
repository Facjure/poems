title: It�s Only A Way He�s Got
---

 (As sung by the camp fire.)


No doubt the saying�s all abroad,
And rattling through the land.
We hear it at the mangle, too,
With �What are you going to stand?�
I�m sure I don�t know which to choose,
There�s really such a lot�
But I hope my song you�ll not refuse,
For it�s only a way I�ve got.

 Chorus: Tol, lol, litter, tol, lol.
 Tol, lol, the rol, lay.

In Sydney town a gal I met,
Her dress was rather gay,
I think the place, it was Pitt Street,
Or somewhere near that way.
Says she, �The night is very cold,
Pray, stand a drop of Hot.
I hope my freedom you�ll excuse,
For it�s only a way I�ve got.�

 Chorus: Tol, lol, &amp;c.

The drink we soon put out of sight,
And off for home did walk,
When a fellow came up and quite polite
To her began to talk.
He drew my ticker from my fob,
And bolted like a shot.
Says she, �Oh, take no notice, Bob,
It�s only a way he�s got.�

 Chorus: Tol, lol, &amp;c.

Says I, �I�ll soon catch you, my chap,�
And arter him I flies,
When another stepped up and knocked my hat
Completely o�er my eyes.
He from my pocket drew my purse,
And off with it did trot;
Says she, �It�s well it is no worse,
 But it�s only a way he�s got.�

 Chorus: Tol, lol, &amp;c.

A little further on we went.
I had got rather shy.
Then a butcher ran his tray
Right bang into my eye.
The fellow said it was my fault,
Called me a drunken sot.
Then, like a thief, he slunk away,
�Twas only a way he�d got!

 Chorus: Tol, lol, &amp;c.

Now, as we walked along the street,
A lot of chaps we met.
I saw they on a game were bent;
Says they, �How fat you get!�
I got from them some ugly pokes,
They made me a regular Scot.
They said, �Oh, never mind our jokes,
It�s only a way we�ve got!�

Chorus: Tol, lol, &amp;c.

I have grown tired of Sydney town
Since I�ve lost all my cash,
And so will up the country go,
And tell them of my smash.
Oh, then we�ll have such lots of fun,
I�ll court Miss Polly Scott;
And if she asks me what I mean
I�ll tell her it�s a way I�ve got.

 Chorus: Tol, lol, &amp;c.
