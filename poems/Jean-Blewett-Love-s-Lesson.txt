One lesson let us bear in mind - 
 Be very gentle with our own,
Be to their faults a little blind,
 Nor wound them by a look or tone.

Put self behind! turn tender eyes;
 Keep back the words that hurt and sting;
We learn, when sorrow makes us wise,
 Forbearance is the grandest thing.

Be patient lest some day we turn
 Our eyes on loved one fast asleep,
And whisper, as we lean and yearn,
 "How often I have made you weep!

"Some loved you not and words let fall
 That must have piercï¿½d your gentle breast,
But I, who loved you best of all,
 Hurt you far more than all the rest."

One lesson let us keep in mind - 
 To hold our dear ones close and fast,
Since loyal hearts are hard to find,
 And life and love so soon are past.
