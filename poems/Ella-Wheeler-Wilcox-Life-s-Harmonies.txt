Let no man pray that he know not sorrow,
 Let no soul ask to be free from pain,
For the gall of to-day is the sweet of to-morrow,
 And the moment's loss is the lifetime's gain.

Through want of a thing does its worth redouble,
 Through hunger's pangs does the feast content,
And only the heart that has harboured trouble
 Can fully rejoice when joy is sent.

Let no man shrink from the bitter tonics
 Of grief, and yearning, and need, and strife,
For the rarest chords in the soul's harmonics
 Are found in the minor strains of life.
