 I.

The slanted storm tossed at their feet
 The frost-nipped Autumn leaves;
The park's high pines were caked with sleet
 And ice-spears armed the eaves.
They strolled adown the pillared pines
To part where wet and twisted vines
About the gate-posts flapped and beat.
She watched him dimming in the rain
 Along the river's misty shore,
And laughed with lips that sneered disdain
 "To meet no more!"


 II.

'Mong heavy roses weighed with dew
 The chirping crickets hid;
Down the honeysuckle avenue
 Creaked the green katydid.
The scattered stars smiled thro' the pines;
Thro' stately windows draped with vines
The rising moonlight's silver blew.
He stared at lips proud, white, and dead,
 A chiseled calm that wore;
Despair moaned on the lips that said
 "To meet no more."
