title: A Southern Girl.
---

Serious but smiling, stately and serene,
 And dreamier than a flower;
A girl in whom all sympathies convene
 As perfumes in a bower;
Through whom one feels what soul and heart may mean,
 And their resistless power.

Eyes, that commune with the frank skies of truth,
 Where thought like starlight curls;
Lips of immortal rose, where love and youth
 Nestle like two sweet pearls;
Hair, that suggests the Bible braids of RUTH,
 Deeper than any girl's.

When first I saw you, 't was as if within
 My soul took shape some song - 
Played by a master of the violin - 
 A music pure and strong,
That rapt my soul above all earthly sin
 To heights that know no wrong.
