title: Epitaph On Robert Southey.

 Christian! for none who scorns that holy name
 Can gaze with honest eyes on Southey's fame;
 Christian! bow down thy head in humble fear,
 And think what God-given powers lie silenced here:
 Wit, judgment, memory, patience unsubdued,
 Conception vast, and pious fortitude.
 Learning possessed no steeps, and truth no shore,
 Beyond his step to tread, his wing to soar;
 His was the historian's pen, the poet's lyre,
 The churchman's ardour, and the patriot's fire;
 While fireside charities, Heaven's gentlest dower,
 Lent genius all their warmth and all their power.
 O Church and State of England! thine was he
 In living fame, thine be his memory!
 Thou saw'st him live, in faith expire,
 Go, bid thy sons to follow, and admire!
