title: A Nameless Epitaph

This sentence have I left behind:
An aching body, and a mind
Not wholly clear, nor wholly blind,
Too keen to rest, too weak to find,
That travails sore, and brings forth wind,
Are Godï¿½s worst portion to mankind.

Another
Ask not my name, O friend!
That Being only, which hath known each man
From the beginning, can
Remember each unto the end
