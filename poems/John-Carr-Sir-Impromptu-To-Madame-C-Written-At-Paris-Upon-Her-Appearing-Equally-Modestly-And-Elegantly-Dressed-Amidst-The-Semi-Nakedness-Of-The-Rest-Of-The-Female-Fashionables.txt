title: Impromptu To Madame C ----  Written At Paris, Upon Her Appearing Equally Modestly And Elegantly Dressed, Amidst The Semi-Nakedness Of The Rest Of The Female Fashionables.

Whilst, in a dress that one might swear
The whole was made of woven air,
Pert Fashion spreads her senseless sway
Over the giddy and the gay
(Who think, by showing all their charms,
Lovers will fly into their arms),
In thee shall Wit and Virtue find
A friend more genial to their mind;
And Modesty shall gain in thee
A surer, chaster, victory.
