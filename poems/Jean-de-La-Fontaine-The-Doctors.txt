[1]

 The selfsame patient put to test
 Two doctors, Fear-the-worst and Hope-the-best.
 The latter hoped; the former did maintain
 The man would take all medicine in vain.
 By different cures the patient was beset,
 But erelong cancell'd nature's debt,
 While nursed
 As was prescribed by Fear-the-worst.
 But over the disease both triumph'd still.
 Said one, 'I well foresaw his death.'
 'Yes,' said the other, 'but my pill
 Would certainly have saved his breath.'
