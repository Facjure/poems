title: Imperfection
---

 Not as the eye hath seen, shall we behold
 Romance and beauty, when we've passed away;
 That robed the dull facts of the intimate day
 In life's wild raiment of unusual gold:
 Not as the ear hath heard, shall we be told,
 Hereafter, myth and legend once that lay
 Warm at the heart of Nature, clothing clay
 In attribute of no material mold.
 These were imperfect of necessity,
 That wrought thro' imperfection for far ends
 Of perfectness, As calm philosophy,
 Teaching a child, from his high heav'n descends
 To Earth's familiar things; informingly
 Vesting his thoughts with that it comprehends.
