 Long-favoured England! be not thou misled
 By monstrous theories of alien growth,
 Lest alien frenzy seize thee, waxing wroth,
 Self-smitten till thy garments reek dyed red
 With thy own blood, which tears in torrents shed
 Fail to wash out, tears flowing ere thy troth
 Be plighted, not to ease but sullen sloth,
 Or wan despair the ghost of false hope fled
 Into a shameful grave. Among thy youth,
 My Country! if such warning be held dear,
 Then shall a Veteran's heart be thrilled with joy,
 One who would gather from eternal truth,
 For time and season, rules that work to cheer
 Not scourge, to save the People not destroy.
