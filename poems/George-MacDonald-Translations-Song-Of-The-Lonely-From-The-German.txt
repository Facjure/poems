Son, first-born, at home abiding!
 All without is cold and bare:
Hide me from the tempest's chiding
 Warm beside the Father's chair.

I am homesick, Lord of splendour!
 Twilight fills my soul with fright:
Let thy countenance befriend her,
 Shining from the halls of light.

I am homesick, loving Father!
 Long years hath the pain increased:
Soon, oh soon! thy children gather
 To the endless marriage-feast.
