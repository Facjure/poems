title: The Heart Healed And Changed By Mercy.
---

Sin enslaved me many years,
And led me bound and blind;
Till at length a thousand fears
Came swarming o�er my mind.


�Where,� I said, in deep distress,
�Will these sinful pleasures end?
How shall I secure my peace,
And make the Lord my friend?�


Friends and ministers said much
The gospel to enforce;
But my blindness still was such,
I chose a legal course:
Much I fasted, watch�d, and strove,
Scarce would show my face abroad,
Fear�d almost to speak or move,
A stranger still to God.


Thus afraid to trust his grace,
Long time did I rebel;
Till, despairing of my case,
Down at his feet I fell:
Then my stubborn heart he broke,
And subdued me to his sway;
By a simple word he spoke,
�Thy sins are done away.�
