A Song.


Happy and free, securely blest,
 No beauty could disturb my rest;
 My amorous heart was in despair,
 To find a new victorious fair.

Till you descending on our plains,
 With foreign force renew my chains:
 Where now you rule without control
 The mighty sovereign of my soul.

Your smiles have more of conquering charms,
 Than all your native country arms;
 Their troops we can expel with ease,
 Who vanquish only when we please.

But in your eyes, oh! there's the spell,
 Who can see them, and not rebel?
 You make us captives by your stay,
 Yet kill us if you go away.
