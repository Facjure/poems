The foamy waves are swishing
As patiently we thud,
But O the wave of wishing
That surges in my blood!

Along the ocean�s rim, now,
With never-ceasing song,
I wish that I could swim now
And shove the boat along.

My heart is crying, tireless,
The word it has to say.
What need have we of wireless
Who know a better way?

The slow craft plunges nor�ward
And welters on the blue:
My thoughts are floating forward
And swooping home to you.

Your magic love is tingling
In every vein of me,
And you and I are mingling
In spite of rolling sea.

Yet O that I could borrow
That albatross�s flight!
To-morrow, Love, to-morrow
Is our supreme delight.
