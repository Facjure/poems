OD. iii. 13.


Bandusia, stainless mirror of the sky!
Thine is the flower-crown'd bowl, for thee shall die,
 When dawns again yon sun, the kid;
 Whose budding horns, half-seen, half-hid,

Challenge to dalliance or to strife - in vain!
Soon must the hope of the wild herd be slain,
 And those cold springs of thine
 With blood incarnadine.

Fierce glows the Dog-star, but his fiery beam
Toucheth not thee: still grateful thy cool stream
 To labour-wearied ox,
 Or wanderer from the flocks:

And henceforth thou shalt be a royal fountain:
My harp shall tell how from yon cavernous mountain,
 Topt by the brown oak-tree,
 Thou breakest babblingly.
