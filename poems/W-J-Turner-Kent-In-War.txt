The pebbly brook is cold to-night,
 Its water soft as air,
A clear, cold, crystal-bodied wind
 Shadowless and bare,
Leaping and running in this world
 Where dark-horned cattle stare:

Where dark-horned cattle stare, hoof-firm
 On the dark pavements of the sky,
And trees are mummies swathed in sleep
 And small dark hills crowd wearily;
Soft multitudes of snow-grey clouds
 Without a sound march by.

Down at the bottom of the road
 I smell the woody damp
Of that cold spirit in the grass,
 And leave my hill-top camp -
Its long gun pointing in the sky -
 And take the Moon for lamp.

I stop beside the bright cold glint
 Of that thin spirit in the grass,
So gay it is, so innocent!
 I watch its sparkling footsteps pass
Lightly from smooth round stone to stone,
 Hid in the dew-hung grass.

My lamp shines in the globes of dew,
 And leaps into that crystal wind
Running along the shaken grass
 To each dark hole that it can find -
The crystal wind, the Moon my lamp,
 Have vanished in a wood that's blind.

High lies my small, my shadowy camp,
 Crowded about by small dark hills;
With sudden small white flowers the sky
 Above the woods' dark greenness fills;
And hosts of dark-browed, muttering trees
 In trance the white Moon stills.

I move among their tall grey forms,
 A thin moon-glimmering, wandering Ghost,
Who takes his lantern through the world
 In search of life that he has lost,
While watching by that long lean gun
 Up on his small hill post.
