What phantom is this that appears
Through the purple mist of the years,
 Itself but a mist like these?
A woman of cloud and of fire;
It is she; it is Helen of Tyre,
 The town in the midst of the seas.

O Tyre! in thy crowded streets
The phantom appears and retreats,
 And the Israelites that sell
Thy lilies and lions of brass,
Look up as they see her pass,
 And murmur "Jezebel!"

Then another phantom is seen
At her side, in a gray gabardine,
 With beard that floats to his waist;
It is Simon Magus, the Seer;
He speaks, and she pauses to hear
 The words he utters in haste.

He says: "From this evil fame,
From this life of sorrow and shame,
 I will lift thee and make thee mine;
Thou hast been Queen Candace,
And Helen of Troy, and shalt be
 The Intelligence Divine!"

Oh, sweet as the breath of morn,
To the fallen and forlorn
 Are whispered words of praise;
For the famished heart believes
The falsehood that tempts and deceives,
 And the promise that betrays.

So she follows from land to land
The wizard's beckoning hand,
 As a leaf is blown by the gust,
Till she vanishes into night.
O reader, stoop down and write
 With thy finger in the dust.

O town in the midst of the seas,
With thy rafts of cedar trees,
 Thy merchandise and thy ships,
Thou, too, art become as naught,
A phantom, a shadow, a thought,
 A name upon men's lips.
