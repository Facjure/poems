title: Not I
---

 As I came out of Wiseman's Street,
 The air was thick with driving sleet;
 Crossing over Proudman's Square,
 Cold clouds and louring dulled the air;
 But as I turned to Goodman's Lane,
 The burning sun came out again;
 And on the roof of Children's Row
 In solemn glory shone the snow.
 There did I lodge; there hope to die:
 Envying no man - no, not I.
