Turn to thy window in the silver hour
 That day comes stepping down the hills of night,
Infolded as the leaves infold a flower
 By all her rose-leaf robes of misty light.

Then, like a joy born out of blackest sorrow,
 The miracle of morning seems to say,
"There is no night without its dear to-morrow,
 No lonely dark that does not find the day."
