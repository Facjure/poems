A brother wandered forth with me,
Beside a barren beach:
He harped on things beyond the sea,
And out of reach.

He hinted once of unknown skies,
And then I would not hark,
But turned away from steadfast eyes,
Into the dark.

And said �an ancient faith is dead
And wonder fills my mind:
I marvel how the blind have led
So long the blind.

�Behold this truth we only know
That night is on the land!
And we a weary way must go
To find God�s hand.�

I wept �Our fathers told us, Lord,
That Thou wert kind and just,
But lo! our wailings fly abroad
For broken trust.

�How many evil ones are here
Who mocking go about,
Because we are too faint with fear
To wrestle Doubt!

�Thy riddles are beyond the ken
Of creatures of the sod:
Remember that we are but men,
And Thou art God!

�O, doting world, methinks your stay
Is weaker than a reed!
Our Father turns His face away;
�Tis dark indeed.�

The evening woods lay huddled there,
All wrapped in silence strange:
A sudden wind and lo! the air
Was filled with change.

�Your words are wild,� my brother said,
�For God�s voice fills the breeze;
Go hide yourself, as Adam did,
Amongst the trees.

�I pluck the shoes from off my feet,
But dare to look around;
Behold,� he said, �my Lord I greet,
On holy ground!�

And God spake through the wind to me
�Shake off that gloom of Fear,
You fainting soul who could not see
That I was near.

�Why vex me crying day and night?
You call on me to hark!
But when I bless your world with light,
Who makes it dark?

�Is there a ravelled riddle left
That you would have undone?
What other doubts are there to sift?�
I answered �None.�

�My son, look up, if you would see
The Promise on your way,
And turn a trustful face to me.�
I whispered �Yea.�
