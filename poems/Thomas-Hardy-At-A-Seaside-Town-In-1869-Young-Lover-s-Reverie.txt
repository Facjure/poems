title: At A Seaside Town In 1869 - Young Lover's Reverie
---

I went and stood outside myself,
 Spelled the dark sky
 And ship-lights nigh,
And grumbling winds that passed thereby.

Then next inside myself I looked,
 And there, above
 All, shone my Love,
That nothing matched the image of.

Beyond myself again I ranged;
 And saw the free
 Life by the sea,
And folk indifferent to me.

O 'twas a charm to draw within
 Thereafter, where
 But she was; care
For one thing only, her hid there!

But so it chanced, without myself
 I had to look,
 And then I took
More heed of what I had long forsook:

The boats, the sands, the esplanade,
 The laughing crowd;
 Light-hearted, loud
Greetings from some not ill-endowed;

The evening sunlit cliffs, the talk,
 Hailings and halts,
 The keen sea-salts,
The band, the Morgenblatter Waltz.

Still, when at night I drew inside
 Forward she came,
 Sad, but the same
As when I first had known her name.

Then rose a time when, as by force,
 Outwardly wooed
 By contacts crude,
Her image in abeyance stood . . .

At last I said: This outside life
 Shall not endure;
 I'll seek the pure
Thought-world, and bask in her allure.

Myself again I crept within,
 Scanned with keen care
 The temple where
She'd shone, but could not find her there.

I sought and sought. But O her soul
 Has not since thrown
 Upon my own
One beam! Yea, she is gone, is gone.

From an old note.
