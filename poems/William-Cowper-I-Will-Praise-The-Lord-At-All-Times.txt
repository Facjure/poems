title: I Will Praise The Lord At All Times.

Winter has a joy for me,
While the Saviour�s charms I read,
Lowly, meek, from blemish free,
In the snowdrop�s pensive head.


Spring returns, and brings along
Life-invigorating suns:
Hark! the turtle�s plaintive song
Seems to speak his dying groans!


Summer has a thousand charms,
All expressive of his worth;
�Tis his sun that lights and warms,
His the air that cools the earth.


What! has Autumn left to say
Nothing of a Saviour�s grace?
Yes, the beams of milder day
Tell me of his smiling face.


Light appears with early dawn,
While the sun makes haste to rise;
See his bleeding beauties drawn
On the blushes of the skies.


Evening with a silent pace,
Slowly moving in the west,
Shows an emblem of his grace,
Points to an eternal rest.
