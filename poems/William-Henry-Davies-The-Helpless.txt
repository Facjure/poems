Those poor, heartbroken wretches, doomed
 To hear at night the clocks' hard tones;
They have no beds to warm their limbs,
 But with those limbs must warm cold stones;
Those poor weak men, whose coughs and ailings
Force them to tear at iron railings.

Those helpless men that starve, my pity;
 Whose waking day is never done;
Who, save for their own shadows, are
 Doomed night and day to walk alone:
They know no bright face but the sun's,
So cold and dark are human ones.
