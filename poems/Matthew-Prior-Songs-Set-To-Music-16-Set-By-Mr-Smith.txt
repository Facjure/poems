Accept, my Love, as true a heart
As ever lover gave;
'Tis free (it vows) from my art,
And proud to be your slave.

Then take it kindly, as 'twas meant,
And let the giver live,
Who with it would the world have sent
Had it been his to give.

And that Dorinda may not fear
I e'er will prove untrue,
My vows shall, ending with the year,
With it begin a new.
