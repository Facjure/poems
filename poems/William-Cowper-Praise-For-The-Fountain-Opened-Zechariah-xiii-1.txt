title: Praise For The Fountain Opened. - Zechariah xiii.1.
---

There is a fountain fill�d with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel�s veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.


The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there have I, as vile as he,
Wash�d all my sins away.


Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransom�d church of God
Be saved to sin no more.


E�er since, by faith, I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.


Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I�ll sing thy power to save;
When this poor lisping stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave.


Lord, I believe thou hast prepared
(Unworthy though I be)
For me a blood-bought free reward,
A golden harp for me!


�Tis strung, and tuned, for endless years,
And form�d by power divine,
To sound in God the Father�s ears
No other name but thine.
