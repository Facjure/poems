A.
Back here, but now, the jobber John
Come by, an' cried, "Well done, zing on,
I thought as I come down the hill,
An' he�rd your zongs a-ring�n sh'ill,
Who woudden like to come, an' fling
A pe�ir o' prongs where you did zing?"
J.
Aye, aye, he woudden vind it pla�,
To work all day a-me�k�n hay,
Or pitch�n o't, to e�rms a-spread
By lwoaders, yards above his head,
'T'ud me�ke en wipe his dripp�n brow.
A.
Or else a-re�k�n a'ter plow.
J.
Or work�n, wi' his nimble pick,
A-stiffled wi' the hay, at rick.
A.
Our Company would suit en best,
When we do te�ke our bit o' rest,
At nunch, a-gather'd here below
The she�de the�se wide-bough'd woak do drow,
Where hiss�n froth mid rise, an' float
In horns o' e�le, to wet his droat.
J.
Aye, if his swell�n han' could drag
A meat-slice vrom his dinner bag.
'T'ud me�ke the busy little chap
Look rather glum, to zee his lap
Wi' all his meal ov woone dry crowst,
An' vinny cheese so dry as dowst.
A.
Well, I dont grumble at my food,
'Tis wholesome, John, an' zoo 'tis good.
J.
Whose re�ke is that a-ly�n there?
Do look a bit the woo'se vor wear.
A.
Oh! I mus' get the man to me�ke
A tooth or two vor thik wold re�ke,
'Tis le�bor lost to strike a stroke
Wi' him, wi' ha'f his teeth a-broke.
J.
I should ha' thought your han' too fine
To break your re�ke, if I broke mine.
A.
The ramsclaws thin'd his wooden gum
O' two teeth here, an' here were zome
That broke off when I re�k'd a patch
O' groun' wi' Jimmy, vor a match:
An' here's a gap where woone or two
Wer broke by Simon's clumsy shoe,
An' when I gi'ed his poll a poke,
Vor better luck, another broke.
In what a veag have you a-swung
Your pick, though, John? His stem's a-sprung.
J.
When I an' Simon had a het
O' pook�n, yonder, vor a bet,
The prongs o'n gi'd a tump a poke,
An' then I vound the stem o'n broke,
But they do me�ke the stems o' picks
O' stuff so brittle as a kicks.
A.
There's poor wold Je�ne, wi' wrinkled skin,
A-tell�n, wi' her peak�d chin,
Zome te�le ov her young days, poor soul.
Do me�ke the young-woones smile. 'Tis droll.
What is it? Stop, an' let's goo near.
I do like the�se wold te�les. Let's hear.
