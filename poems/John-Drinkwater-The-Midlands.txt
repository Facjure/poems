Black in the summer night my Cotswold hill
 Aslant my window sleeps, beneath a sky
Deep as the bedded violets that fill
 March woods with dusky passion. As I lie
Abed between cool walls I watch the host
 Of the slow stars lit over Gloucester plain,
And drowsily the habit of these most
 Beloved of English lands moves in my brain,
While silence holds dominion of the dark,
Save when the foxes from the spinneys bark.

I see the valleys in their morning mist
 Wreathed under limpid hills in moving light,
Happy with many a yeoman melodist:
 I see the little roads of twinkling white
Busy with fieldward teams and market gear
 Of rosy men, cloth-gaitered, who can tell
The many-minded changes of the year,
 Who know why crops and kine fare ill or well;
I see the sun persuade the mist away,
Till town and stead are shining to the day.

I see the wagons move along the rows
 Of ripe and summer-breathing clover-flower,
I see the lissom husbandman who knows
 Deep in his heart the beauty of his power,
As, lithely pitched, the full-heaped fork bids on
 The harvest home. I hear the rickyard fill
With gossip as in generations gone,
 While wagon follows wagon from the hill.
I think how, when our seasons all are sealed,
Shall come the unchanging harvest from the field.

I see the barns and comely manors planned
 By men who somehow moved in comely thought,
Who, with a simple shippon to their hand,
 As men upon some godlike business wrought;
I see the little cottages that keep
 Their beauty still where since Plantagenet
Have come the shepherds happily to sleep,
 Finding the loaves and cups of cider set;
I see the twisted shepherds, brown and old,
Driving at dusk their glimmering sheep to fold.

And now the valleys that upon the sun
 Broke from their opal veils, are veiled again,
And the last light upon the wolds is done,
 And silence falls on flock and fields and men;
And black upon the night I watch my hill,
 And the stars shine, and there an owly wing
Brushes the night, and all again is still,
 And, from this land of worship that I sing,
I turn to sleep, content that from my sires
I draw the blood of England's midmost shires.
