In Returning A Poem Of Mr. Cowperï¿½s, Lent To The Writer, On Condition She Should Neither Show It Nor Take A Copy.


What wonder! if my wavering hand
Had dared to disobey,
When Hesketh gave a harsh command,
And Cowper led astray.


Then take this tempting gift of thine,
By pen uncopied yet!
But canst thou Memory confine,
Or teach me to forget?


More lasting than the touch of art,
Her characters remain;
When written by a feeling heart
On tablets of the brain.
