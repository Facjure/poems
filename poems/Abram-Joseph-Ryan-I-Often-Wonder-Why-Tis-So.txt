title: I Often Wonder Why 'Tis So
---

Some find work where some find rest,
 And so the weary world goes on:
I sometimes wonder which is best;
 The answer comes when life is gone.

Some eyes sleep when some eyes wake,
 And so the dreary night-hours go;
Some hearts beat where some hearts break;
 I often wonder why 'tis so.

Some wills faint where some wills fight,
 Some love the tent, and some the field;
I often wonder who are right --
 The ones who strive, or those who yield?

Some hands fold where other hands
 Are lifted bravely in the strife;
And so thro' ages and thro' lands
 Move on the two extremes of life.

Some feet halt where some feet tread,
 In tireless march, a thorny way;
Some struggle on where some have fled;
 Some seek when others shun the fray.

Some swords rust where others clash,
 Some fall back where some move on;
Some flags furl where others flash
 Until the battle has been won.

Some sleep on while others keep
 The vigils of the true and brave:
They will not rest till roses creep
 Around their name above a grave.
