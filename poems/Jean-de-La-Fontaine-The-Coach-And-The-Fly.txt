title: The Coach And The Fly.

[1]

 Upon a sandy, uphill road,
 Which naked in the sunshine glow'd,
 Six lusty horses drew a coach.
 Dames, monks, and invalids, its load,
 On foot, outside, at leisure trode.
 The team, all weary, stopp'd and blow'd:
 Whereon there did a fly approach,
 And, with a vastly business air.
 Cheer'd up the horses with his buzz, - 
 Now pricked them here, now prick'd them there,
 As neatly as a jockey does, - 
 And thought the while - he knew 'twas so - 
 He made the team and carriage go, - 
 On carriage-pole sometimes alighting - 
 Or driver's nose - and biting.
 And when the whole did get in motion,
 Confirm'd and settled in the notion,
 He took, himself, the total glory, - 
 Flew back and forth in wondrous hurry,
 And, as he buzz'd about the cattle,
 Seem'd like a sergeant in a battle,
 The files and squadrons leading on
 To where the victory is won.
 Thus charged with all the commonweal,
 This single fly began to feel
 Responsibility too great,
 And cares, a grievous crushing weight;
 And made complaint that none would aid
 The horses up the tedious hill - 
 The monk his prayers at leisure said - 
 Fine time to pray! - the dames, at will,
 Were singing songs - not greatly needed!
 Thus in their ears he sharply sang,
 And notes of indignation ran, - 
 Notes, after all, not greatly heeded.
 Erelong the coach was on the top:
 'Now,' said the fly, 'my hearties, stop
 And breathe; - I've got you up the hill;
 And Messrs. Horses, let me say,
 I need not ask you if you will
 A proper compensation pay.'

 Thus certain ever-bustling noddies
 Are seen in every great affair;
 Important, swelling, busy-bodies,
 And bores 'tis easier to bear
 Than chase them from their needless care.
