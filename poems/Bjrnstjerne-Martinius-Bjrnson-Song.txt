Song brings us light with the power of lending
 Glory to brighten the work that we find;
Song brings us warmth with the power of rending
 Rigor and frost in the swift-melting mind.
Song is eternal with power of blending
 Time that is gone and to come in the soul,
Fills it with yearnings that flow without ending,
 Seeking that sea where the light-surges roll.

Song brings us union, while gently beguiling
 Discord and doubt on its radiant way;
Song brings us union and leads, reconciling
 Battle-glad passions by harmony's sway,
Unto the beautiful, valiant, and holy
 - Some can pass over its long bridge of light
Higher and higher to visions that solely
 Faith can reveal to the spirit's pure sight.

Songs from the past of the past's longings telling,
 Pensive and sad cast a sunset's red glow;
Present time's longings in sweet music dwelling,
 Grateful the soul of the future shall know.
Youth of all ages in song here are meeting,
 Sounding in tone and in word their desire;
 - More than we think, from the dead bringing greeting,
 Gather to-night in our festival choir.
