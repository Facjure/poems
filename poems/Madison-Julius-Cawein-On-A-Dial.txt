To-morrow and to-morrow
Is but to-day:
The world wags but to borrow
Time that grows gray: - 
Grammercy! time's but sorrow
And - well away!

Since time hales but to sadness
And to decay,
Men needs wax fools for madness,
Laugh, curse, and pray;
Death grapples with their badness - 
The Devil's to pay.
