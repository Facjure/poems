title: Do Not Cheer, Men Are Dying," Said Capt. Phillips, In The Spanish-American War.
---

 Do not cheer, for men are dying
 From their distant homes in pain;
 And the restless sea is darkened
 By a flood of crimson rain.

 Do not cheer, for anxious mothers
 Wait and watch in lonely dread;
 Vainly waiting for the footsteps
 Never more their paths to tread.

 Do not cheer, while little children
 Gather round the widowed wife,
 Wondering why an unknown people
 Sought their own dear father's life.

 Do not cheer, for aged fathers
 Bend above their staves and weep,
 While the ocean sings the requiem
 Where their fallen children sleep.

 Do not cheer, for lips are paling
 On which lay the mother's kiss;
 'Mid the dreadful roar of battle
 How that mother's hand they miss!


 Do not cheer: once joyous maidens,
 Who the mazy dance did tread,
 Bow their heads in bitter anguish,
 Mourning o'er their cherished dead.

 Do not cheer while maid and matron
 In this strife must bear a part;
 While the blow that strikes a soldier
 Reaches to some woman's heart.

 Do not cheer till arbitration
 O'er the nations holds its sway,
 And the century now closing
 Ushers in a brighter day.

 Do not cheer until the nation
 Shall more wise and thoughtful grow
 Than to staunch a stream of sorrow
 By an avalanche of woe.

 Do not cheer until each nation
 Sheathes the sword and blunts the spear,
 And we sing aloud for gladness:
 Lo, the reign of Christ is here,

 And the banners of destruction
 From the battlefield are furled,
 And the peace of God descending
 Rests upon a restless world.
