Now as the twilight's doubtful interval
 Closes with night's accomplished certainty,
 A wizard wind goes crying eerily;
And in the glade unsteady shadows crawl,
Timed to the trees, whose voices rear and fall
 As with some dreadful witches' ecstasy,
 Flung upward to the dark, whence glitters free
The crooked moon, impendent over all.

Twin veils of covering cloud and silence thrown
 Across the movement and the sound of things,
Make blank the night, till in the broken west
The moon's ensanguined blade awhile is shown....
The night grows whole again.... The shadows rest,
 Gathered beneath a greater shadow's wings.
