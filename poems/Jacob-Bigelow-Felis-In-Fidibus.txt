	 Heigh diddle diddle,
	 The cat and the fiddle,
	 The cow jumped over the moon.
	The little dog laughed
	To see such a craft,
	 And the dish ran away with the spoon.

	 Hidideldelis,
	 In fidibus felis,
	Super lunam vacca saltavit.
	 Tum risit canicula,
	 Vis� re tam ridicul�,
	Et lanx cochleare raptavit.
