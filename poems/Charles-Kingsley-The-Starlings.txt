Early in spring time, on raw and windy mornings,
Beneath the freezing house-eaves I heard the starlings sing - 
'Ah dreary March month, is this then a time for building wearily?
 Sad, sad, to think that the year is but begun.'

Late in the autumn, on still and cloudless evenings,
Among the golden reed-beds I heard the starlings sing - 
'Ah that sweet March month, when we and our mates were courting merrily;
 Sad, sad, to think that the year is all but done.'

Eversley, 1848.
