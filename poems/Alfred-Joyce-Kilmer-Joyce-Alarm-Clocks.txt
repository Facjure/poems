 When Dawn strides out to wake a dewy farm
Across green fields and yellow hills of hay
The little twittering birds laugh in his way
 And poise triumphant on his shining arm.
 He bears a sword of flame but not to harm
The wakened life that feels his quickening sway
And barnyard voices shrilling "It is day!"
 Take by his grace a new and alien charm.

 But in the city, like a wounded thing
That limps to cover from the angry chase,
 He steals down streets where sickly arc-lights sing,
And wanly mock his young and shameful face;
 And tiny gongs with cruel fervor ring
In many a high and dreary sleeping place.
