title: Oh, Sweet Content!
---

Oh, sweet content, that turns the labourer's sweat
 To tears of joy, and shines the roughest face;
How often have I sought you high and low,
 And found you still in some lone quiet place;

Here, in my room, when full of happy dreams,
 With no life heard beyond that merry sound
Of moths that on my lighted ceiling kiss
 Their shadows as they dance and dance around;

Or in a garden, on a summer's night,
 When I have seen the dark and solemn air
Blink with the blind bats' wings, and heaven's bright face
 Twitch with the stars that shine in thousands there.
