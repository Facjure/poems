title: Rhymes for Gloriana - I.  The Doll upon the Topmost Bough
---

 This doll upon the topmost bough,
 This playmate-gift, in Christmas dress,
 Was taken down and brought to me
 One sleety night most comfortless.

 Her hair was gold, her dolly-sash
 Was gray brocade, most good to see.
 The dear toy laughed, and I forgot
 The ill the new year promised me.
