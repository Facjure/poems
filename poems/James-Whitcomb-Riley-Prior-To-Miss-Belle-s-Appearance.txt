Whenever we whips one anuther,
Tries to whip US - an' we RUN -

Nen she gives us cake - an' pie -
Don't she, Charley? - when we come in
An' pomise never to do it ag'in!

But Uncle Bob HE calls me "Billy" -

An' it's that way yet!" - An' Pa grabs his hat

'Cause that's the reason he married yer Ma!"

An' our Ma says 'at "Belle couldn'

An' PA says 'at "you're soft as puddun!" -
An' UNCLE BOB says "you're a good-un -
'Cause he can tell by yer nose!"-

In the poller on th' pianer, some day,

Till she gits mad-like he wants her to!
