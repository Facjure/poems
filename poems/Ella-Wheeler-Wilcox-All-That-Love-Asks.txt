title: All That Love Asks
---

 "All that I ask," says Love, "is just to stand
 And gaze, unchided, deep in thy dear eyes;
 For in their depths lies largest Paradise.
Yet, if perchance one pressure of thy hand
 Be granted me, then joy I thought complete
Were still more sweet.

 "All that I ask," says Love, "all that I ask,
 Is just thy hand-clasp.Could I brush thy cheek
 As zephyrs brush a rose leaf, words are weak
To tell the bliss in which my soul would bask.
 There is no language but would desecrate
A joy so great.

 "All that I ask, is just one tender touch
 Of that soft cheek.Thy pulsing palm in mine,
 Thy dark eyes lifted in a trust divine,
And those curled lips that tempt me overmuch
 Turned where I may not seize the supreme bliss
Of one mad kiss.

 "All that I ask," says Love, "of life, of death,
 Or of high heaven itself, is just to stand,
 Glance melting into glance, hand twined in hand,
The while I drink the nectar of thy breath
 In one sweet kiss, but one, of all thy store,
I ask no more."

 "All that I ask" - nay, self-deceiving Love,
 Reverse thy phrase, so thus the words may fall,
 In place of "all I ask," say, "I ask all,"
All that pertains to earth or soars above,
 All that thou wert, art, will be, body, soul,
Love asks the whole,
