Far stretched the landscape, fair, without a flaw,
 Down to one silver sheet, some stream or cloud,
 Through glamorous mists. Midway, an engine ploughed
Across the scene. In meditative awe
I stood and gazed, absorbed in what I saw,
 Till sweet-breathed Evening came, the pensive-browed,
 And creeping from the city, spread her shroud
Over the sunlit slopes of Outremont.

Soon the mild Indian summer will be past,
 November's mists soon flee December's snows;
The trees may perish, and the winter's blast
 Wreck the tall windmills; these weak eyes may close;
But ever will that scene continue fast
 Fixed in my soul, where richer still it grows.
