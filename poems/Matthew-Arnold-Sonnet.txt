One lesson, Nature, let me learn of thee,
One lesson that in every wind is blown,
One lesson of two duties serv�d in one,
Though the loud world proclaim their enmity
Of Toil unsever�d from Tranquillity:
Of Labour, that in still advance outgrows
Far noisier schemes, accomplish�d in Repose,
Too great for haste, too high for rivalry.
Yes, while on earth a thousand discords ring,
Man�s senseless uproar mingling with his toil,
Still do thy sleepless ministers move on,
Their glorious tasks in silence perfecting:
Still working, blaming still our vain turmoil;
Labourers that shall not fail, when man is gone
