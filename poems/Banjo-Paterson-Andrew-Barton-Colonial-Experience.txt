 [By A New Chum]

 (Air: �So Early in the Morning.�)


When first I came to Sydney Cove
And up and down the streets did rove,
I thought such sights I ne�er did see
Since first I learnt my A, B, C.

 Chorus

 Oh! it�s broiling in the morning,
 It�s toiling in the morning,
 It�s broiling in the morning,
 It�s toiling all day long.

Into the park I took a stroll�
I felt just like a buttered roll.
A pretty name �The Sunny South!�
A better one �The Land of Drouth!�

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.

Next day into the bush I went,
On wild adventure I was bent,
Dame Nature�s wonders I�d explore,
All thought of danger would ignore.

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.

The mosquitoes and bull-dog ants
Assailed me even through my pants.
It nearly took my breath away
To hear the jackass laugh so gay!

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.

This lovely country, I�ve been told,
Abounds in silver and in gold.
You may pick it up all day,
Just as leaves in autumn lay!

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.

Marines will chance this yarn believe,
But bluejackets you can�t deceive.
Such pretty stories will not fit,
Nor can I their truth admit.

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.

Some say there�s lots of work to do.
Well, yes, but then, �twixt me and you,
A man may toil and broil all day�
The big, fat man gets all the pay,

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.

Mayhap such good things there may be,
But you may have them all, for me,
Instead of roaming foreign parts
I wish I�d studied the Fine Arts!

 Chorus: Oh! it�s broiling, &amp;c.
