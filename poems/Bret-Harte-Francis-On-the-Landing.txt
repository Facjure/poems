BOBBY, aetat. 3�. JOHNNY, aetat. 4�.


BOBBY
DO you know why they�ve put us in that back room,
Up in the attic, close against the sky,
And made believe our nursery�s a cloak-room?
Do you know why?

JOHNNY
No more I don�t, nor why that Sammy�s mother,
What Ma thinks horrid, �cause he bunged my eye,
Eats an ice cream, down there, like any other!
No more don�t I!

BOBBY
Do you know why Nurse says it isn�t manners
For you and me to ask folks twice for pie,
And no one hits that man with two bananas?
Do you know why?

JOHNNY
No more I don�t, nor why that girl, whose dress is
Off of her shoulders, don�t catch cold and die,
When you and me gets croup when we undresses!
No more don�t I!

BOBBY
Perhaps she ain�t as good as you and I is,
And God don�t want her up there in the sky,
And lets her live to come in just when pie is
Perhaps that�s why!

JOHNNY
Do you know why that man that�s got a cropped head
Rubbed it just now as if he felt a fly?
Could it be, Bobby, something that I dropded?
And is that why?

BOBBY
Good boys behaves, and so they don�t get scolded,
Nor drop hot milk on folks as they pass by.

JOHNNY (piously)
Marbles would bounce on Mr. Jones� bald head
But I sha�n�t try!

BOBBY
Do you know why Aunt Jane is always snarling
At you and me because we tells a lie,
And she don�t slap that man that called her darling?
Do you know why?

JOHNNY
No more I don�t, nor why that man with Mamma
Just kissed her hand.

BOBBY
She hurt it and that�s why;
He made it well, the very way that Mamma
Does do to I.

JOHNNY
I feel so sleepy. . . . Was that Papa kissed us?
What made him sigh, and look up to the sky?

BOBBY
We weren�t downstairs, and he and God had missed us,
And that was why!
