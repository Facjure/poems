(WHEN DYBB�L WAS CAPTURED)
(See Note 25)

Dannebrog of old was seeming
 Snow-white, rosy red,
Through the mists of ages beaming,
 Heaven's gift outspread,
Rich as fruits of Denmark's planting,
Grand as song of heroes chanting,
Spirit-winged to deeds of daring
 O'er the wide world faring.

Dannebrog, thou now art seeming
 Death-pale, bloody red,
Like a dying sea-gull gleaming
 White with blood o'erspread.
Purple tides the wounds are showing
From thy faith in justice flowing;
Denmark, bear the cross, thy burden
 Honor is thy guerdon!
