title: Go Wander

Go, wander, little book,
Nor let thy wand'ring cease;
May all who on these pages look
From sin find sweet release,

Through Christ, God's holy son,
Who left his throne in heaven
And e'en death's anguish did not shun
That we might be forgiven.

How should our thoughts and deeds
Exalt this mighty friend,
Who died, yet lives and intercedes
And loves us to the end!
