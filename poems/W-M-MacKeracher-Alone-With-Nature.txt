title: Alone With Nature.

The rain came suddenly, and to the shore
 I paddled, and took refuge in the wood,
 And, leaning on my paddle, there I stood
In mild contentment watching the downpour,
Feeling as oft I have felt heretofore,
 Rooted in nature, that supremest mood
 When all the strength, the peace, of solitude,
Sink into and pervade the being's core.

And I have thought, if man could but abate
 His need of human fellowship, and find
Himself through Nature, healing with her balm
The world's sharp wounds, and growing in her state,
 What might and greatness, majesty of mind,
Sublimity of soul and Godlike calm!
