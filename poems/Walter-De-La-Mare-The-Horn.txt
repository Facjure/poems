 Hark! is that a horn I hear,
In cloudland winding sweet - 
 And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,
And silver-shod light feet?

 Is it the elfin laughter
Of fairies riding faint and high,
 Beneath the branches of the moon,
Straying through the starry sky?

 Is it in the globï¿½d dew
Such sweet melodies may fall?
 Wood and valley - all are still,
Hushed the shepherd's call.
