 O big old tree, so tall an' fine,
Where all us childern swings an' plays,
 Though neighbers says you're on the line
Between Pa's house an' Mr. Gray's, - 
 Us childern used to almost fuss,
Old Tree, about you when we 'd play. - 
 We'd argy you belonged to us,
An' them Gray-kids the other way!

 Till Elsie, one time she wuz here
An' playin' wiv us - Don't you mind,
 Old Mister Tree? - an' purty near
She scolded us the hardest kind
 Fer quar'llin' 'bout you thataway,
An' say she'll find - ef we'll keep still - 
 Whose tree you air fer shore, she say,
An' settle it fer good, she will!


 So all keep still: An' nen she gone
An' pat the Old Tree, an' says she, - 
 "Whose air you, Tree?" an' nen let on
Like she's a-list'nin' to the Tree, - 
 An' nen she say, "It's settled, - 'cause
The Old Tree says he's all our tree - 
 His trunk belongs to bofe your Pas,
But shade belongs to you an' me."
