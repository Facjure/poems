 The King of Yellow Butterflies,
 The King of Yellow Butterflies,
 The King of Yellow Butterflies,
 Now orders forth his men.
 He says "The time is almost here
 When violets bloom again."
 Adown the road the fickle rout
 Goes flashing proud and bold,
 Adown the road the fickle rout
 Goes flashing proud and bold,
 Adown the road the fickle rout
 Goes flashing proud and bold,
 They shiver by the shallow pools,
 They shiver by the shallow pools,
 They shiver by the shallow pools,
 And whimper of the cold.
 They drink and drink. A frail pretense!
 They love to pose and preen.
 Each pool is but a looking glass,
 Where their sweet wings are seen.
 Each pool is but a looking glass,
 Where their sweet wings are seen.
 Each pool is but a looking glass,
 Where their sweet wings are seen.
 Gentlemen adventurers! Gypsies every whit!
 They live on what they steal. Their wings
 By briars are frayed a bit.
 Their loves are light. They have no house.
 And if it rains today,
 They'll climb into your cattle-shed,
 They'll climb into your cattle-shed,
 They'll climb into your cattle-shed,
 And hide them in the hay,
 And hide them in the hay,
 And hide them in the hay,
 And hide them in the hay.
