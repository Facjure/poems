As I go and shop, sir!
If a car I stop, sir!
 Where you chance to sit,
And you want to read, sir!
Never mind or heed, sir!
 I'll not care a bit.

For it's now aesthetic
To be quite athletic.
 That's our fad, you know.
I can hold the strap, sir!
And keep off your lap, sir!
 As we jolting go.

If you read on blindly,
I shall take it kindly,
 All the car's not mine.
But, if you sit and stare, sir!
At my eyes and hair, sir!
 I must draw the line.

If the stare is meant, sir!
For a compliment, sir!
 As we jog through town,
Allow me to suggest, sir!
A woman oft looks best, sir!
 When she's sitting down.
