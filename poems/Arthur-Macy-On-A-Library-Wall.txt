 When faltering fingers bid me cease to write,
 And, laying down the pen, I seek the Night,
 May those, to whom the Daylight still is sweet,
 With loving lips my name ofttimes repeat.
 And should Belshazzar's spirit hither stray,
 And linger o'er the lines I write to-day,
 May he, who wept for Babylonia's fall,
 Look kindly at this "writing on the wall"!
