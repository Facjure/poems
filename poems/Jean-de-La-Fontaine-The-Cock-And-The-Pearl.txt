[1]

 A cock scratch'd up, one day,
 A pearl of purest ray,
 Which to a jeweller he bore.
 'I think it fine,' he said,
 'But yet a crumb of bread
 To me were worth a great deal more.'

 So did a dunce inherit
 A manuscript of merit,
 Which to a publisher he bore.
 ''Tis good,' said he, 'I'm told,
 Yet any coin of gold
 To me were worth a great deal more.'
