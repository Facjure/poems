Good-morning, sun, 'mid the leaves so green - 
 Mind of youth in the dales' deep reaches,
 Smile that brightens their somber speeches,
Heaven's gold on our earth-dust seen!

Good-morning, sun, o'er the royal tower!
 Kindly thou beckonest forth each maiden;
 Kindle each heart as a star light-laden,
Twinkling so clear, though a sad night lower!

Good-morning, sun, o'er the mountain-side!
 Light the land that still sleep disguises
 Till it awakens and fresh arises
For yonder day in thy warmth's full tide!
