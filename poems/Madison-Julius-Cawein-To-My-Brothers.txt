 Not while I live may I forget
 That garden which my spirit trod!
 Where dreams were flowers, wild and wet,
 And beautiful as God.

 Not while I breathe, awake adream,
 Shall live again for me those hours,
 When, in its mystery and gleam,
 I met her 'mid the flowers.

 Eyes, talismanic heliotrope,
 Beneath mesmeric lashes, where
 The sorceries of love and hope
 Had made a shining lair.

 And daydawn brows, whereover hung
 The twilight of dark locks; and lips,
 Whose beauty spoke the rose's tongue
 Of fragrance-voweled drips.

 I will not tell of cheeks and chin,
 That held me as sweet language holds;
 Nor of the eloquence within
 Her bosom's moony molds.

 Nor of her large limbs' languorous
 Wind-grace, that glanced like starlight through
 Her ardent robe's diaphanous
 Web of the mist and dew.

 There is no star so pure and high
 As was her look; no fragrance such
 At her soft presence; and no sigh
 Of music like her touch.

 Not while I live may I forget
 That garden of dim dreams! where I
 And Song within the spirit met,
 Sweet Song, who passed me by.
