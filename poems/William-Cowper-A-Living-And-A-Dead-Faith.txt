title: A Living And A Dead Faith.
---

The Lord receives his highest praise
From humble minds and hearts sincere;
While all the loud professor says
Offends the righteous Judge�s ear.


To walk as children of the day,
To mark the precepts� holy light,
To wage the warfare, watch, and pray,
Show who are pleasing in his sight.


Not words alone it cost the Lord,
To purchase pardon for his own;
Nor will a soul, by grace restored,
Return the Saviour words alone.


With golden bells, the priestly vest,
And rich pomegranates border�d round,[1]
The need of holiness express�d,
And call�d for fruit, as well as sound.


Easy, indeed, it were to reach
A mansion in the courts above,
If swelling words and fluent speech
Might serve, instead of faith and love.


But none shall gain the blissful place,
Or God�s unclouded glory see,
Who talks of free and sovereign grace,
Unless that grace has made him free!
