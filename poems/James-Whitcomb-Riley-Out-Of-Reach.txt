title: Out Of Reach?
---

You think them "out of reach," your dead?
 Nay, by my own dead, I deny
Your "out of reach." - Be comforted:
 'Tis not so far to die.

O by their dear remembered smiles
 And outheld hands and welcoming speech,
They wait for us, thousands of miles
 This side of "out-of-reach."
