title: Sonnet LXXXVIII. The Prospect A Flooded Vale.
---

The three following Sonnets are written in the character of Werter; the sentiments and images chiefly, but not intirely taken from one of his letters.

 Up this bleak Hill, in wintry Night's dread hour,
With mind congenial to the scene, I come!
To see my Valley in the lunar gloom,
To see it whelm'd. - Amid the cloudy lour
 Gleams the cold Moon; - and shows the ruthless power
Of yon swoln Floods, that white with turbid foam
Roll o'er the fields; - and, billowy as they roam,
Against the bushes beat! - A Vale no more,
 A troubled Sea, toss'd by the furious Wind! - 
Alas! the wild and angry Waves efface
Pathway, and hedge, and bank, and stile! - I find
 But one wide waste of waters! - In controul
Thus dire, to tides of Misery and Disgrace
Love opes the flood-gates of my struggling Soul.
