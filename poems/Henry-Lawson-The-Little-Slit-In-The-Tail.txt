title: The Little Slit In The Tail
---

I�m glad that the Bushmen can�t see me now
A-doing it tall in the town;
I�ve an inch-brimmed hat on my sun-burnt brow,
And my collar jumps up and down.
I�m wearing a vest that would charm a snake,
And a tie like a lost soul�s wail;
And I�m dressed in a coat of the latest make,
With a little slit in the tail:
With a little slit in the tail of it,
With a little slit in the tail.

My pants alone are a thing of joy,
And they�re built to show my bends,
With a crease behind and a crease before,
And a little curl in the ends.
I carry my nose-rag in my cuff,
And the lot should get me gaol,
I paid five guineas for my rig-out,
And one for the slit in the tail:
For the little slit in the tail of it,
For the little slit in the tail.
