title: Song Of The Road
---

I am a Road; a good road, fair and smooth and broad;
 And I link with my beautiful tether
 Town and Country together,
Like a ribbon rolled on the earth, from the reel of God.
 Oh, great the life of a Road!

I am a Road; a long road, leading on and on;
 And I cry to the world to follow,
 Past meadow and hill and hollow,
Through desolate night, to the open gates of dawn.
 Oh, bold the life of a Road!

I am a Road; a kind road, shaped by strong hands.
 I make strange cities neighbours;
 The poor grow rich with my labours,
And beauty and comfort follow me through the lands.
 Oh, glad the life of a Road!

I am a Road; a wise road, knowing all men's ways;
 And I know how each heart reaches
 For the things dear Nature teaches;
And I am the path that leads into green young Mays.
 Oh, sweet the life of a Road!

I am a Road; and I speed away from the slums,
 Away from desolate places,
 Away from unused spaces;
Wherever I go, there order from chaos comes.
 Oh, brave the life of a Road!

I am a Road; and I would make the whole world one.
 I would give hope to duty,
 And cover the earth with beauty.
Do you not see, O men! how all this might be done?
 So vast the power of the Road!
