When I was in my teens,
 I loved dear Margaretta:
I know not what it means,
 I can not now forget her!
That vision of the past
 My head is ever crazing;
Yet, when I saw her last,
 I could not speak for gazing!
Oh, lingering bud of May!
 Dear as when first I met her;
Worn in my heart always,
 Life-cherished Margaretta!

We parted near the stile,
 As morn was faintly breaking:
For many a weary mile
 Oh how my heart was aching!
But distance, time, and change,
 Have lost me Margaretta;
And yet 'tis sadly strange
 That I can not forget her!
O queen of rural maids--
 My dark-eyed Magaretta--
The heart the mind upbraids
 That struggles to forget her!

My love, I know, will seem
 A wayward, boyish folly;
But, ah! it was a dream
 Most sweet--most melancholy.
Were mine the world's domain,
 To me 'twere fortune better
To be a boy again,
 And dream of Margaretta.
Oh! memory of the past,
 Why linger to regret her?
My first love was my last!
 And that is Margaretta!
