title: The House Of Fear.

Vast are its halls, as vast the halls and lone
Where DEATH stalks listening to the wind and rain;
And dark that house, where I shall meet again
My long-dead Sin in some dread way unknown;
For I have dreamed of stairs of haunted stone,
And spectre footsteps I have fled in vain;
And windows glaring with a blood-red stain,
And horrible eyes, that burn me to the bone,
Within a face that looks as that black night
It looked when deep I dug for it a grave, - 
The dagger wound above the brow, the thin
Blood trickling down slantwise the ghastly white; - 
And I have dreamed not even GOD can save
Me and my soul from that risen Sin.
