---

 The Spring of life is o'er with me,
 And love and all gone by;
 Like broken bough upon yon tree,
 I'm left to fade and die.
 Stern ruin seized my home and me,
 And desolate's my cot:
 Ruins of halls, the blasted tree,
 Are emblems of my lot.

 I lived and loved, I woo'd and won,
 Her love was all to me,
 But blight fell o'er that youthful one,
 And like a blasted tree
 I withered, till I all forgot
 But Mary's smile on me;
 She never lived where love was not,
 And I from bonds was free.

 The Spring it clothed the fields with pride,
 When first we met together;
 And then unknown to all beside
 We loved in sunny weather;
 We met where oaks grew overhead,
 And whitethorns hung with may;
 Wild thyme beneath her feet was spread,
 And cows in quiet lay.

 I thought her face was sweeter far
 Than aught I'd seen before--
 As simple as the cowslips are
 Upon the rushy moor:
 She seemed the muse of that sweet spot,
 The lady of the plain,
 And all was dull where she was not,
 Till we met there again.
