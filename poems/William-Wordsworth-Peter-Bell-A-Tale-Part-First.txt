 PART FIRST

 ALL by the moonlight river side
 Groaned the poor Beast alas! in vain;
 The staff was raised to loftier height,
 And the blows fell with heavier weight
 As Peter struck and struck again.

 "Hold!" cried the Squire, "against the rules
 Of common sense you're surely sinning;
 This leap is for us all too bold;
 Who Peter was, let that be told,
 And start from the beginning." 

 "A Potter, Sir, he was by trade,"
 Said I, becoming quite collected;
 "And wheresoever he appeared,
 Full twenty times was Peter feared
 For once that Peter was respected.

 "He, two-and-thirty years or more,
 Had been a wild and woodland rover;
 Had heard the Atlantic surges roar
 On farthest Cornwall's rocky shore,
 And trod the cliffs of Dover. 

 "And he had seen Caernarvon's towers,
 And well he knew the spire of Sarum;
 And he had been where Lincoln bell
 Flings o'er the fen that ponderous knell 
 A far-renowned alarum!

 "At Doncaster, at York, and Leeds,
 And merry Carlisle had be been;
 And all along the Lowlands fair,
 All through the bonny shire of Ayr
 And far as Aberdeen. 

 "And he had been at Inverness;
 And Peter, by the mountain-rills,
 Had danced his round with Highland lasses;
 And he had lain beside his asses
 On lofty Cheviot Hills:

 "And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales,
 Among the rocks and winding 'scars',
 Where deep and low the hamlets lie
 Beneath their little patch of sky
 And little lot of stars: 

 "And all along the indented coast,
 Bespattered with the salt-sea foam;
 Where'er a knot of houses lay
 On headland, or in hollow bay; 
 Sure never man like him did roam!

 "As well might Peter, in the Fleet,
 Have been fast bound, a begging debtor; 
 He travelled here, he travelled there, 
 But not the value of a hair
 Was heart or head the better. 

 "He roved among the vales and streams,
 In the green wood and hollow dell;
 They were his dwellings night and day, 
 But nature ne'er could find the way
 Into the heart of Peter Bell.

 "In vain, through every changeful year,
 Did Nature lead him as before;
 A primrose by a river's brim
 A yellow primrose was to him,
 And it was nothing more. 

 "Small change it made on Peter's heart
 To see his gentle panniered train
 With more than vernal pleasure feeding,
 Where'er the tender grass was leading
 Its earliest green along the lane.

 "In vain, through water, earth, and air,
 The soul of happy sound was spread,
 When Peter on some April morn,
 Beneath the broom or budding thorn,
 Made the warm earth his lazy bed. 

 "At noon, when, by the forest's edge
 He lay beneath the branches high,
 The soft blue shy did never melt
 Into his heart; he never felt
 The witchery of the soft blue sky!

 "On a fair prospect some have looked
 And felt, as I have heard them say,
 As if the moving time had been
 A thing as steadfast as the scene
 On which they gazed themselves away. 

 "Within the breast of Peter Bell
 These silent raptures found no place;
 He was a Carl as wild and rude
 As ever hue-and-cry pursued,
 As ever ran a felon's race.

 "Of all that lead a lawless life,
 Of all that love their lawless lives,
 In city or in village small,
 He was the wildest far of all; 
 He had a dozen wedded wives. 

 "Nay, start not! wedded wives and twelve!
 But how one wife could e'er come near him,
 In simple truth I cannot tell;
 For, be it said of Peter Bell
 To see him was to fear him.

 "Though Nature could not touch his heart
 By lovely forms, and silent weather,
 And tender sounds, yet you might see
 At once, that Peter Bell and she
 Had often been together. 

 "A savage wildness round him hung
 As of a dweller out of doors;
 In his whole figure and his mien
 A savage character was seen
 Of mountains and of dreary moors.

 "To all the unshaped half-human thoughts
 Which solitary Nature feeds
 'Mid summer storms or winter's ice,
 Had Peter joined whatever vice
 The cruel city breeds. 

 "His face was keen as is the wind
 That cuts along the hawthorn-fence; 
 Of courage you saw little there,
 But, in its stead, a medley air
 Of cunning and of impudence.

 "He had a dark and sidelong walk,
 And long and slouching was his gait;
 Beneath his looks so bare and bold,
 You might perceive, his spirit cold
 Was playing with some inward bait. 

 "His forehead wrinkled was and furred;
 A work, one half of which was done
 By thinking of his 'whens' and 'hows;'
 And half, by knitting of his brows
 Beneath the glaring sun.

 "There was a hardness in his cheek,
 There was a hardness in his eye,
 As if the man had fixed his face,
 In many a solitary place,
 Against the wind and open sky!" 

 ONE NIGHT, (and now my little Bess!
 We've reached at last the promised Tale:)
 One beautiful November night,
 When the full moon was shining bright
 Upon the rapid river Swale,

 Along the river's winding banks
 Peter was travelling all alone; 
 Whether to buy or sell, or led
 By pleasure running in his head,
 To me was never known. 

 He trudged along through copse and brake,
 He trudged along o'er hill and dale;
 Nor for the moon cared he a tittle,
 And for the stars he cared as little,
 And for the murmuring river Swale.

 But, chancing to espy a path
 That promised to cut short the way
 As many a wiser man hath done,
 He left a trusty guide for one
 That might his steps betray. 

 To a thick wood he soon is brought
 Where cheerily his course he weaves,
 And whistling loud may yet be heard,
 Though often buried, like a bird
 Darkling, among the boughs and leaves.

 But quickly Peter's mood is changed,
 And on he drives with cheeks that burn
 In downright fury and in wrath; 
 There's little sign the treacherous path
 Will to the road return! 

 The path grows dim, and dimmer still;
 Now up, now down, the Rover wends,
 With all the sail that he can carry,
 Till brought to a deserted quarry 
 And there the pathway ends.

 He paused for shadows of strange shape,
 Massy and black, before him lay;
 But through the dark, and through the cold,
 And through the yawning fissures old,
 Did Peter boldly press his way 

 Right through the quarry; and behold
 A scene of soft and lovely hue!
 Where blue and grey, and tender green,
 Together make as sweet a scene
 As ever human eye did view.

 Beneath the clear blue sky he saw
 A little field of meadow ground;
 But field or meadow name it not;
 Call it of earth a small green plot,
 With rocks encompassed round, 

 The Swale flowed under the grey rocks,
 But he flowed quiet and unseen; 
 You need a strong and stormy gale
 To bring the noises of the Swale
 To that green spot, so calm and green!

 And is there no one dwelling here,
 No hermit with his beads and glass?
 And does no little cottage look
 Upon this soft and fertile nook?
 Does no one live near this green grass? 

 Across the deep and quiet spot
 Is Peter driving through the grass 
 And now has reached the skirting trees;
 When, turning round his head, he sees
 A solitary Ass.

 "A Prize!" cries Peter but he first
 Must spy about him far and near:
 There's not a single house in sight,
 No woodman's hut, no cottage light 
 Peter, you need not fear! 

 There's nothing to be seen but woods,
 And rocks that spread a hoary gleam,
 And this one Beast, that from the bed
 Of the green meadow hangs his head
 Over the silent stream.

 His head is with a halter bound;
 The halter seizing, Peter leapt
 Upon the Creature's back, and plied
 With ready heels his shaggy side;
 But still the Ass his station kept. 

 Then Peter gave a sudden jerk,
 A jerk that from a dungeon-floor
 Would have pulled up an iron ring;
 But still the heavy-headed Thing
 Stood just as he had stood before!

 Quoth Peter, leaping from his seat,
 "There is some plot against me laid;"
 Once more the little meadow-ground
 And all the hoary cliffs around
 He cautiously surveyed, 

 All, all is silent rocks and woods,
 All still and silent far and near!
 Only the Ass, with motion dull,
 Upon the pivot of his skull
 Turns round his long left ear.

 Thought Peter, What can mean all this?
 Some ugly witchcraft must be here!
 Once more the Ass, with motion dull,
 Upon the pivot of his skull
 Turned round his long left ear. 

 Suspicion ripened into dread;
 Yet with deliberate action slow,
 His staff high-raising, in the pride
 Of skill, upon the sounding hide,
 He dealt a sturdy blow.

 The poor Ass staggered with the shock;
 And then, as if to take his ease,
 In quiet uncomplaining mood,
 Upon the spot where he had stood,
 Dropped gently down upon his knees: 

 As gently on his side he fell;
 And by the river's brink did lie;
 And, while he lay like one that mourned,
 The patient Beast on Peter turned
 His shining hazel eye.

 'Twas but one mild, reproachful look,
 A look more tender than severe;
 And straight in sorrow, not in dread,
 He turned the eye-ball in his head
 Towards the smooth river deep and clear. 

 Upon the Beast the sapling rings;
 His lank sides heaved, his limbs they stirred;
 He gave a groan, and then another,
 Of that which went before the brother,
 And then he gave a third.

 All by the moonlight river side
 He gave three miserable groans;
 And not till now hath Peter seen
 How gaunt the Creature is, how lean
 And sharp his staring bones! 

 With legs stretched out and stiff he lay: 
 No word of kind commiseration
 Fell at the sight from Peter's tongue;
 With hard contempt his heart was wrung,
 With hatred and vexation.

 The meagre beast lay still as death;
 And Peter's lips with fury quiver;
 Quoth he, "You little mulish dog,
 I'll fling your carcase like a log
 Head-foremost down the river!" 

 An impious oath confirmed the threat 
 Whereat from the earth on which he lay
 To all the echoes, south and north,
 And east and west, the Ass sent forth
 A long and clamorous bray!

 This outcry, on the heart of Peter,
 Seems like a note of joy to strike, 
 Joy at the heart of Peter knocks;
 But in the echo of the rocks
 Was something Peter did not like. 

 Whether to cheer his coward breast,
 Or that he could not break the chain,
 In this serene and solemn hour,
 Twined round him by demoniac power,
 To the blind work he turned again.

 Among the rocks and winding crags;
 Among the mountains far away;
 Once more the ass did lengthen out
 More ruefully a deep-drawn shout,
 The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray! 

 What is there now in Peter's heart!
 Or whence the might of this strange sound?
 The moon uneasy looked and dimmer,
 The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer,
 And the rocks staggered all around 

 From Peter's hand the sapling dropped!
 Threat has he none to execute;
 "If any one should come and see
 That I am here, they'll think," quoth he,
 "I'm helping this poor dying brute." 

 He scans the Ass from limb to limb,
 And ventures now to uplift his eyes;
 More steady looks the moon, and clear
 More like themselves the rocks appear
 And touch more quiet skies.

 His scorn returns his hate revives;
 He stoops the Ass's neck to seize
 With malice that again takes flight;
 For in the pool a startling sight
 Meets him, among the inverted trees. 

 Is it the moon's distorted face?
 The ghost-like image of a cloud?
 Is it a gallows there portrayed?
 Is Peter of himself afraid?
 Is it a coffin, or a shroud?

 A grisly idol hewn in stone?
 Or imp from witch's lap let fall?
 Perhaps a ring of shining fairies?
 Such as pursue their feared vagaries
 In sylvan bower, or haunted hall? 

 Is it a fiend that to a stake
 Of fire his desperate self is tethering?
 Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell
 In solitary ward or cell,
 Ten thousand miles from all his brethren?

 Never did pulse so quickly throb,
 And never heart so loudly panted;
 He looks, he cannot choose but look;
 Like some one reading in a book 
 A book that is enchanted. 

 Ah, well-a-day for Peter Bell!
 He will be turned to iron soon,
 Meet Statue for the court of Fear!
 His hat is up and every hair
 Bristles, and whitens in the moon!

 He looks, he ponders, looks again;
 He sees a motion hears a groan;
 His eyes will burst his heart will break 
 He gives a loud and frightful shriek,
 And back he falls, as if his life were flown!
