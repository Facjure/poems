 It seems that dawn will never climb
 The eastern hills;
 And, clad in mist and flame and rime,
 Make flashing highways of the rills.

 The night is as an ancient way
 Through some dead land,
 Whereon the ghosts of Memory
 And Sorrow wander hand in hand.

 By which man's works ignoble seem,
 Unbeautiful;
 And grandeur, but the ruined dream
 Of some proud queen, crowned with a skull.

 A way past-peopled, dark and old,
 That stretches far
 Its only real thing, the cold
 Vague light of sleep's one fitful star.
