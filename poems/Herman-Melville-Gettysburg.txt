 The Check.
 (July, 1863.)


 O pride of the days in prime of the months
 Now trebled in great renown,
 When before the ark of our holy cause
 Fell Dagon down - 
 Dagon foredoomed, who, armed and targed,
 Never his impious heart enlarged
 Beyond that hour; god walled his power,
 And there the last invader charged.

 He charged, and in that charge condensed
 His all of hate and all of fire;
 He sought to blast us in his scorn,
 And wither us in his ire.
 Before him went the shriek of shells - 
 Aerial screamings, taunts and yells;
 Then the three waves in flashed advance
 Surged, but were met, and back they set:
 Pride was repelled by sterner pride,
 And Right is a strong-hold yet.

 Before our lines it seemed a beach
 Which wild September gales have strown
 With havoc on wreck, and dashed therewith
 Pale crews unknown - 
 Men, arms, and steeds. The evening sun
 Died on the face of each lifeless one,
 And died along the winding marge of fight
 And searching-parties lone.

 Sloped on the hill the mounds were green,
 Our center held that place of graves,
 And some still hold it in their swoon,
 And over these a glory waves.
 The warrior-monument, crashed in fight,[8]
 Shall soar transfigured in loftier light,
 A meaning ampler bear;
 Soldier and priest with hymn and prayer
 Have laid the stone, and every bone
 Shall rest in honor there.
 
 8. Among numerous head-stones or monuments on Cemetery Hill, marred or destroyed by the enemy's concentrated fire, was one, somewhat conspicuous, of a Federal officer killed before Richmond in 1862. 

On the 4th of July 1865, the Gettysburg National Cemetery, on the same height with the original burial-ground, was consecrated, and the corner-stone laid of a commemorative pile.
