Nay, Romney, nay - I will not hear you say
 Those words again:"I love you, love you sweet!"
 You are profane - blasphemous.I repeat,
You are no actor for so grand a play.

You love with all your heart?Well, that may be;
 Some cups are fashioned shallow.Should I try
 To quench my thirst from one of those, when dry - 
I who have had a full bowl proffered me - 

A new bowl brimming with a draught divine,
 One single taste thrilled to the finger-tips?
 Think you I even care to bathe my lips
With this poor sweetened water you call wine?

And though I spilled the nectar ere 'twas quaffed,
 And broke the bowl in wanton folly, yet
 I would die of my thirst ere I would wet
My burning lips with any meaner draught.

So leave me, Romney.One who has seen a play
 Enacted by a star cannot endure
 To see it rendered by an amateur.
You know not what Love is - now go away!
