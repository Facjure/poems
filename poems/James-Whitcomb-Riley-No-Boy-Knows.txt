title: No Boy Knows
---

 There are many things that boys may know - 
 Why this and that are thus and so, - 
 Who made the world in the dark and lit
 The great sun up to lighten it:
 Boys know new things every day - 
 When they study, or when they play, - 
 When they idle, or sow and reap - 
 But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

 Boys who listen - or should, at least, - 
 May know that the round old earth rolls East; - 
 And know that the ice and the snow and the rain - 
 Ever repeating their parts again - 
 Are all just water the sunbeams first
 Sip from the earth in their endless thirst,
 And pour again till the low streams leap. - 
 But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

 A boy may know what a long glad while
 It has been to him since the dawn's first smile,
 When forth he fared in the realm divine
 Of brook-laced woodland and spun-sunshine; - 
 He may know each call of his truant mates,
 And the paths they went, - and the pasture-gates
 Of the 'cross-lots home through the dusk so deep. - 
 But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.

 O I have followed me, o'er and o'er,
 From the flagrant drowse on the parlor-floor,
 To the pleading voice of the mother when
 I even doubted I heard it then - 
 To the sense of a kiss, and a moonlit room,
 And dewy odors of locust-bloom - 
 A sweet white cot - and a cricket's cheep. - 
 But no boy knows when he goes to sleep.
