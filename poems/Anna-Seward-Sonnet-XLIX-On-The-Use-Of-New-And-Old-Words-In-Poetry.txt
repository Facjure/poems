title: Sonnet XLIX. On The Use Of New And Old Words In Poetry.

 While with false pride, and narrow jealousy,
Numbers reject each new expression, won,
Perchance, from language richer than our own,
O! with glad welcome may the POET see
 Extension's golden vantage! the decree
Each way exclusive, scorn, and re-enthrone
The obsolete, if strength, or grace of tone
Or imagery await it, with a free,
 And liberal daring! - For the Critic Train,
Whose eyes severe our verbal stores review,
Let the firm Bard require that they explain
 Their cause of censure; then in balance true
Weigh it; but smile at the objections vain
Of sickly Spirits, hating for they do[1]!

1: The particle for is used in the same sense with because, by Shakespear, and Beaumont and Fletcher.

 "But she, and I, were Creatures innocent,
 Lov'd for we did." BEA. and FLE. TWO NOBLE KINSMEN.

" - - Nor must you think
 I will your serious and great business scant
 For she is with me." OTHELLO.

 "They're jealous for they're jealous." OTHELLO.
