title: Crickets on a Strike
---

	 The foolish queen of fairyland
	 From her milk-white throne in a lily-bell,
	 Gave command to her cricket-band
	 To play for her when the dew-drops fell.

	 But the cold dew spoiled their instruments
	 And they play for the foolish queen no more.
	 Instead those sturdy malcontents
	 Play sharps and flats in my kitchen floor.
