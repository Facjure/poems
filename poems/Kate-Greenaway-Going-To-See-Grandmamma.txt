title: Going To See Grandmamma.
---

Little Molly and Damon
Are walking so far,
For they're going to see
Their kind Grandmamma.

And they very well know,
When they get there she'll take
From out of her cupboard
Some very nice cake.

And into her garden
They know they may run,
And pick some red currants,
And have lots of fun.

So Damon to doggie
Says, "How do you do?"
And asks his mamma
If he may not go too.
