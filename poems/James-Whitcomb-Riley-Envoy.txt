Many pleasures of youth have been buoyantly sung -
 And, borne on the winds of delight, may they beat
With their palpitant wings at the hearts of the Young,
 And in bosoms of Age find as warm a retreat! -
Yet sweetest of all of the musical throng,
 Though least of the numbers that upward aspire,
Is the one rising now into wavering song,
 As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.

'Tis a Winter long dead that beleaguers my door
 And muffles his steps in the snows of the past:
And I see, in the embers I'm dreaming before,
 Lost faces of love as they looked on me last: -
The round, laughing eyes of the desk-mate of old
 Gleam out for a moment with truant desire -
Then fade and are lost in a City of Gold,
 As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.

And then comes the face, peering back in my own,
 Of a shy little girl, with her lids drooping low,
As she faltering tells, in a far-away tone,
 The ghost of a story of long, long ago. -
Then her dewy blue eyes they are lifted again;
 But I see their glad light slowly fail and expire,
As I reach and cry to her in vain, all in vain! -
 As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.

Then the face of a Mother looks back, through the mist
 Of tears that are welling; and, lucent with light,
I see the dear smile of the lips I have kissed
 As she knelt by my cradle at morning and night;
And my arms are outheld, with a yearning too wild
 For any but God in His love to inspire,
As she pleads at the foot of His throne for her child, -
 As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.

O pathos of rapture! O glorious pain!
 My heart is a blossom of joy over-run
With a shower of tears, as a lily with rain
 That weeps in the shadow and laughs in the sun.
The blight of the frost may descend on the tree,
 And the leaf and the flower may fall and expire,
But ever and ever love blossoms for me,
 As I sit in the silence and gaze in the fire.
