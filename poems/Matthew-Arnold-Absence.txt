In this fair stranger�s eyes of grey
Thine eyes, my love, I see.
I shudder: for the passing day
Had borne me far from thee.

This is the curse of life: that not
A nobler calmer train
Of wiser thoughts and feelings blot
Our passions from our brain;

But each day brings its petty dust
Our soon-chok�d souls to fill,
And we forget because we must,
And not because we will.

I struggle towards the light; and ye,
Once-long�d-for storms of love!
If with the light ye cannot be,
I bear that ye remove.

I struggle towards the light; but oh,
While yet the night is chill,
Upon Time�s barren, stormy flow,
Stay with me, Marguerite, still!
