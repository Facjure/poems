 God send me tears!
Loose the fierce band that binds my tired brain,
Give me the melting heart of other years,
 And let me weep again!

 Before me pass
The shapes of things inexorably true.
Gone is the sparkle of transforming dew
 From every blade of grass.

 In life's high noon
Aimless I stand, my promised task undone,
And raise my hot eyes to the angry sun
 That will go down too soon.

 Turned into gall
Are the sweet joys of childhood's sunny reign;
And memory is a torture, love a chain
 That binds my life in thrall.

 And childhood's pain
Could to me now the purest rapture yield;
I pray for tears as in his parching field
 The husbandman for rain.

 We pray in vain!
The sullen sky flings down its blaze of brass;
The joys of life all scorched and withering pass;
 I shall not weep again.
