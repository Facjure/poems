At morn the wise man walked abroad,
Proud with the learning of great fools.
He laughed and said, "There is no God - 
'Tis force creates, 'tis reason rules."

Meek with the wisdom of great faith,
At night he knelt while angels smiled,
And wept and cried with anguished breath,
"Jehovah, God, save thou my child."
