title: A Merrymaking In Question
---

"I will get a new string for my fiddle,
 And call to the neighbours to come,
And partners shall dance down the middle
 Until the old pewter-wares hum:
 And we'll sip the mead, cyder, and rum!"

From the night came the oddest of answers:
 A hollow wind, like a bassoon,
And headstones all ranged up as dancers,
 And cypresses droning a croon,
 And gurgoyles that mouthed to the tune.
