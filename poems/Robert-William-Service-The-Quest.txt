 I sought Him on the purple seas,
 I sought Him on the peaks aflame;
 Amid the gloom of giant trees
 And canyons lone I called His name;
 The wasted ways of earth I trod:
 In vain! In vain! I found not God.

 I sought Him in the hives of men,
 The cities grand, the hamlets gray,
 The temples old beyond my ken,
 The tabernacles of to-day;
 All life that is, from cloud to clod
 I sought. . . . Alas! I found not God.

 Then after roamings far and wide,
 In streets and seas and deserts wild,
 I came to stand at last beside
 The death-bed of my little child.
 Lo! as I bent beneath the rod
 I raised my eyes . . . and there was God.
