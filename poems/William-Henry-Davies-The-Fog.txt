I saw the fog grow thick,
 Which soon made blind my ken;
It made tall men of boys,
 And giants of tall men.

It clutched my throat, I coughed;
 Nothing was in my head
Except two heavy eyes
 Like balls of burning lead.

And when it grew so black
 That I could know no place,
I lost all judgment then,
 Of distance and of space.

The street lamps, and the lights
 Upon the halted cars,
Could either be on earth
 Or be the heavenly stars.

A man passed by me close,
 I asked my way, he said,
"Come, follow me, my friend", 
 I followed where he led.

He rapped the stones in front,
 "Trust me," he said, "and come";
I followed like a child, 
 A blind man led me home.
