 This is "The old Home by the Mill" - far we still call it so,
 Although the old mill, roof and sill, is all gone long ago.
 The old home, though, and old folks, and the old spring, and a few
 Old cat-tails, weeds and hartychokes, is left to welcome you!

 Here, Marg'et, fetch the man a tin to drink out of' Our spring
 Keeps kindo-sorto cavin' in, but don't "taste" anything!
 She's kindo agein', Marg'et is - "the old process," like me,
 All ham-stringed up with rheumatiz, and on in seventy-three.

 Jes' me and Marg'et lives alone here - like in long ago;
 The childern all put off and gone, and married, don't you know?
 One's millin' way out West somewhere; two other miller-boys
 In Minnyopolis they air; and one's in Illinoise.

 The oldest gyrl - the first that went - married and died right here;
 The next lives in Winn's Settlement - for purt' nigh thirty year!
 And youngest one - was allus far the old home here - but no! -
 Her man turns in and he packs her 'way off to Idyho!

 I don't miss them like Marg'et does - 'cause I got her, you see;
 And when she pines for them - that's 'cause she's only jes' got me!
 I laugh, and joke her 'bout it all. - But talkin' sense, I'll say,
 When she was tuk so bad last Fall, I laughed the t'other way!

 I haint so favorble impressed 'bout dyin'; but ef I
 Found I was only second-best when us two come to die,
 I'd 'dopt the "new process" in full, ef Marg'et died, you see, -
 I'd jes' crawl in my grave and pull the green grass over me!
