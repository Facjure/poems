 O The Little Lady's dainty
As the picture in a book,
 And her hands are creamy-whiter
Than the water-lilies look;
 Her laugh's the undrown'd music
Of the maddest meadow-brook. - 
 Yet all in vain I praise The Little Lady!

 Her eyes are blue and dewy
As the glimmering Summer-dawn, - 
 Her face is like the eglantine
Before the dew is gone;
 And were that honied mouth of hers
A bee's to feast upon,
 He'd be a bee bewildered, Little Lady!

 Her brow makes light look sallow;
And the sunshine, I declare,
 Is but a yellow jealousy
Awakened by her hair - 
 For O the dazzling glint of it
Nor sight nor soul can bear, - 
 So Love goes groping for The Little Lady.


 And yet she's neither Nymph nor Fay,
Nor yet of Angelkind: - 
 She's but a racing school-girl, with
Her hair blown out behind
 And tremblingly unbraided by
The fingers of the Wind,
 As it wildly swoops upon The Little Lady.
