title: The Heart Courageous
---

Who hath a heart courageous
 Will fight with right good cheer;
For well may he his foes out-face
 Who owns no foe called Fear!

Who hath a heart courageous
 Will fight as knight of old
For that which he doth count his own - 
 Against the world to hold.

Who hath a heart courageous
 Will fight both night and day,
Against the Host Invisible - 
 That holds his soul at bay,

Who hath a heart courageous
 Rests with tranquillity,
For Time he counts not as his foe,
 Nor Death his enemy.
