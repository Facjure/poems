 Dost thou not tire, Isaura, of this play?
 "What play?" Why, this old play of winning hearts!
 Nay, now, lift not thine eyes in that feigned way:
 'Tis all in vain - I know thee and thine arts.

 Let us be frank, Isaura. I have made
 A study of thee; and while I admire
 The practised skill with which thy plans are laid,
 I can but wonder if thou dost not tire.

 Why, I tire even of Hamlet and Macbeth!
 When overlong the season runs, I find
 Those master-scenes of passion, blood, and death,
 After a time do pall upon my mind.

 Dost thou not tire of lifting up thine eyes
 To read the story thou hast read so oft - 
 Of ardent glances and deep quivering sighs,
 Of haughty faces suddenly grown soft?

 Is it not stale, oh, very stale, to thee,
 The scene that follows? Hearts are much the same;
 The loves of men but vary in degree - 
 They find no new expressions for the flame.

 Thou must know all they utter ere they speak,
 As I know Hamlet's part, whoever plays.
 Oh, does it not seem sometimes poor and weak?
 I think thou must grow weary of their ways.

 I pity thee, Isaura! I would be
 The humblest maiden with her dream untold
 Rather than live a Queen of Hearts, like thee,
 And find life's rarest treasures stale and old.

 I pity thee; for now, let come what may,
 Fame, glory, riches, yet life will lack all.
 Wherewith can salt be salted? And what way
 Can life be seasoned after love doth pall?
