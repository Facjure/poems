title: Renewal Of Strength.
---

 The prison-house in which I live
 Is falling to decay,
 But God renews my spirit's strength,
 Within these walls of clay.

 For me a dimness slowly creeps
 Around earth's fairest light,
 But heaven grows clearer to my view,
 And fairer to my sight.

 It may be earth's sweet harmonies
 Are duller to my ear,
 But music from my Father's house
 Begins to float more near.

 Then let the pillars of my home
 Crumble and fall away;
 Lo, God's dear love within my soul
 Renews it day by day.
