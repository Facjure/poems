---

�Would a man �scape the rod?�
Rabbi Ben Karshook saith,
�See that he turn to God
The day before his death.�

�Ay could a man enquire
When it shall come!� I say,
The Rabbi�s eye shoots fire 
�Then let him turn to-day! �

Quoth a young Sadducee:
�Reader of many rolls,
Is it so certain we
Have, as they tell us, souls?�

�Son, there is no reply!�
The Rabbi bit his beard:
�Certain, a soul have I 
We may have none,� he sneer�d.

Thus Karshook, the Hiram�s-Hammer,
The Right-hand Temple-column,
Taught babes in grace their grammar,
And struck the simple, solemn.

Rome, April 27, 1854
