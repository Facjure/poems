 These have a life that hath no part in death;
 These circumscribe the soul and make it strong;
 Between the breathing of a dream and song,
 Building a world of beauty in a breath.
 Unto the heart the voice of this one saith
 Ideals, its emotions live among;
 Unto the mind the other speaks a tongue
 Of visions, where the guess, we christen faith,
 May face the fact of immortality
 As may a rose its unembodied scent,
 Or star its own reflected radiance.
 We do not know these save unconsciously.
 To whose mysterious shadows God hath lent
 No certain shape, no certain countenance.
