(To Edgar Lee Masters, with great respect.)



 Here upon the prairie
 Is our ancestral hall.
 Agate is the dome,
 Cornelian the wall.
 Ghouls are in the cellar,
 But fays upon the stairs.
 And here lived old King Silver Dreams,
 Always at his prayers.

 Here lived grey Queen Silver Dreams,
 Always singing psalms,
 And haughty Grandma Silver Dreams,
 Throned with folded palms.
 Here played cousin Alice.
 Her soul was best of all.
 And every fairy loved her,
 In our ancestral hall.

 Alice has a prairie grave.
 The King and Queen lie low,
 And aged Grandma Silver Dreams,
 Four tombstones in a row.
 But still in snow and sunshine
 Stands our ancestral hall.
 Agate is the dome,
 Cornelian the wall.
 And legends walk about,
 And proverbs, with proud airs.
 Ghouls are in the cellar,
 But fays upon the stairs.
