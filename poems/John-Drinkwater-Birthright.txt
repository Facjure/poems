Lord Rameses of Egypt sighed
 Because a summer evening passed;
And little Ariadne cried
 That summer fancy fell at last
To dust; and young Verona died
 When beauty's hour was overcast.

Theirs was the bitterness we know
 Because the clouds of hawthorn keep
So short a state, and kisses go
 To tombs unfathomably deep,
While Rameses and Romeo
 And little Ariadne sleep.
