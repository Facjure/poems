I

In the evening of our days,
 When the first far stars above
Glimmer dimmer, through the haze,
 Than the dewy eyes of love,
Shall we mournfully revert
 To the vanished morns and Mays
Of our youth, with hearts that hurt, -
 In the evening of our days?


II

Shall the hand that holds your own
 Till the twain are thrilled as now,
Be withheld, or colder grown?
 Shall my kiss upon your brow
Falter from its high estate?
 And, in all forgetful ways,
Shall we sit apart and wait -
 In the evening of our days?


III

Nay, my wife - my life! - the gloom
 Shall enfold us velvetwise,
And my smile shall be the groom
 Of the gladness of your eyes:
Gently, gently as the dew
 Mingles with the darkening maze,
I shall fall asleep with you -
In the evening of our days.
