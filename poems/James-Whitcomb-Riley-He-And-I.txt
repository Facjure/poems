title: He And I
---

Just drifting on together -
He and I -
As through the balmy weather
Of July
 Drift two thistle-tufts imbedded
 Each in each - by zephyrs wedded -
 Touring upward, giddy-headed,
For the sky.

And, veering up and onward,
Do we seem
Forever drifting dawnward
In a dream,
 Where we meet song-birds that know us,
 And the winds their kisses blow us,
 While the years flow far below us
Like a stream.

And we are happy - very -
He and I -
Aye, even glad and merry
Though on high
 The heavens are sometimes shrouded
 By the midnight storm, and clouded
 Till the pallid moon is crowded
From the sky.

My spirit ne'er expresses
Any choice
But to clothe him with caresses
And rejoice;
 And as he laughs, it is in
 Such a tone the moonbeams glisten
 And the stars come out to listen
To his voice.

And so, whate'er the weather,
He and I, -
With our lives linked thus together,
Float and fly
 As two thistle-tufts imbedded
 Each in each - by zephyrs wedded -
 Touring upward, giddy-headed,
For the sky.
