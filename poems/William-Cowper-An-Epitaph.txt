Here lies one who never drew
Blood himself, yet many slew;
Gave the gun its aim, and figure
Made in field, yet ne�er pull�d trigger.
Armed men have gladly made
Him their guide, and him obey�d;
At his signified desire
Would advance, present, and fire�
Stout he was, and large of limb,
Scores have fled at sight of him!
And to all this fame he rose
Only following his nose.
Neptune was he call�d, not he
Who controls the boisterous sea,
But of happier command,
Neptune of the furrow�d land;
And, your wonder vain to shorten,
Pointer to Sir John Throckmorton.
