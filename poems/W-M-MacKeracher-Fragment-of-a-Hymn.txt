God of mercy without measure!
God of all-embracing love!
Show'ring in Thy gracious pleasure
Countless blessings from above;
Bounteous benefits bestowing
In a kind, continuous course,
Favour from Thee ever flowing,
As a stream from ocean source.

Grateful praise my aspiration;
Pardon my presumptuous pen;
And accept my poor oblation,
And forgive its feeble strain;
Thou to whom such praise is given,
Too divine for mortal ears,
In the angel choirs of heaven
And the music of the spheres.
