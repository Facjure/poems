"Yea I have loved thee with an everlasting love."


Love of God! - amazing love!
Height, above all other height,
Depth no creature thought can prove,
Boundless, endless, infinite!
Howsoe'er I sink or rise,
Stretch my powers beyond, abroad,
Pierce the depths or climb the skies,
Find I still the love of God - 
Fount of bliss, exhaustless, free,
Evermore unsealed for me!

Love of Christ! - amazing love!
Vast as His eternity;
Theme of angel-tongues above,
Theme of souls redeemed like me!
Outward to creation's bound,
Up to Heaven's serenest height,
Universal space around,
Swells the chorus day and night - 
Fount of bliss, exhaustless, free,
Evermore unsealed for me!

Oh, these tongues that falter so
When we sing of love like this!
Oh, these songs that, faint and low,
More than half their sweetness miss!
Saviour, lift our music higher
Till the notes to rapture spring!
Touch our lips with hallowed fire
From thine altar while we sing - 
Fount of bliss, exhaustless, free,
Evermore unsealed for me!
