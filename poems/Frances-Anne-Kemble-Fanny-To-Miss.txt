Time beckons on the hours: the expiring year
 Already feels old Winter's icy breath;
As with cold hands, he scatters on her bier
 The faded glories of her Autumn wreath.
As fleetly as the Summer's sunshine past,
 The Winter's snow must melt; and the young Spring,
Strewing the earth with flowers, will come at last,
 And in her train the hour of parting bring.
But, though I leave the harbour, where my heart
 Sometime had found a peaceful resting-place,
Where it lay calmly moored; though I depart,
 Yet, let not time my memory quite efface.
'Tis true, I leave no void, the happy home
 To which you welcomed me, will be as gay,
As bright, as cheerful, when I've turned to roam,
 Once more, upon life's weary onward way.
But oh! if ever by the warm hearth's blaze,
 Where beaming eyes and kindred souls are met,
Your fancy wanders back to former days,
 Let my remembrance hover round you yet.
Then, while before you glides time's shadowy train,
 Of forms long vanished, days and hours long gone,
Perchance my name will be pronounced again,
 In that dear circle where I once was one.
Think of me then, nor break kind memory's spell,
 By reason's censure coldly o'er me cast,
Think only, that I loved ye passing well!
 And let my follies slumber with the past.
