Minneapolis ban qvite bonny
 Ven early fall the dew;
It ban dar dat ay ask Steena
 To mak her promise true, - 
To mak her promise true;
 But she yust pass me by;
And she tal me, "Maester Olaf,
 Yu skol pleese lay down and die."

Her brow ban yust lak snowdrift
 Or Apple Blossom flour;
And she smile lak anyel fallers,
 Ay tenk of her each hour, - 
Ay tenk of her each hour,
 And feel lak ay can cry,
Ven she tal me, "Maester Olaf,
 Yu skol pleese lay down and die."

Like dew on sidevalk falling,
 She du me gude, ay guess.
Ay tal her, "Pleese, Miss Steena,
 Vy don't yu answer yes? - 
Vy don't yu answer yes?"
 But she yust venk her eye,
And she tal me, "Maester Olaf,
 Yu skol pleese lay down and die."
