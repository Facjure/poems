 In the dark waveless sea,
Deep blue under deep blue,
 The fisher drifts by on the tide
In his small pole-balanced canoe.

 Above him the cloud-clapped hills
Crown the dense jungly sweeps;
 The cocoa-nut groves hedge round
The hut where the beach-wave sleeps.

 Is it not better so
To be as this savage is,
 Than to live the wage-slave's life
Of hopeless agonies?
