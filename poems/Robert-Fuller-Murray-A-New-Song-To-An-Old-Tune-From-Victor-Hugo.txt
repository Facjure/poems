If a pleasant lawn there grow
 By the showers caressed,
Where in all the seasons blow
 Flowers gaily dressed,
Where by handfuls one may win
Lilies, woodbine, jessamine,
I will make a path therein
 For thy feet to rest.

If there live in honour's sway
 An all-loving breast
Whose devotion cannot stray,
 Never gloom-oppressed--
If this noble breast still wake
For a worthy motive's sake,
There a pillow I will make
 For thy head to rest.

If there be a dream of love,
 Dream that God has blest,
Yielding daily treasure-trove
 Of delightful zest,
With the scent of roses filled,
With the soul's communion thrilled,
There, oh! there a nest I'll build
 For thy heart to rest.
