title: Little Ballads Of Timely Warning; I: On Dishonesty Arising From Ignorance
---

King Joris was a kind-eyed king,
A dear old, gentle, smiling thing;
But �though by nature meek and mild,
Two things could drive him raving wild,
Dishonesty, its naughty ways; Ingratitude, its sting.

Now, in his court there was a man,
Jones, Royal Court Historian,
Whom Joris, the compassionate,
Had raised from very low estate,
Jones drove for movers, once, a van.

The king supplied all Jones could use:
Pens, ink and paper, clothing, shoes,
Food, money, facts, a desk all fixed,
Five hundred thousand words, well mixed,
And, what I�d like to have, a Muse.

Jones set to work, but, poking �round,
A package in his desk he found
Marked �Punctuations, Use with Care,�
And, looking in, discovered there
Of marks, best grade and mixed, a pound.

He used them! Not. alas! with care,
But sprinkled handfuls everywhere,
Threw commas into b,ut and th,at,
Poured points in ?Mer,!cy: s*e,e t�he c)at,
And rubbed a handful in his hair.

Alas! an Auditor austere
Took stock for Joris once a year!
Of all that precious, priceless pound
No punctuation could be found;
Excuses Joris would not hear!

The headsman with one skilful blow
Removed Jones�s head and shouted, �So
Perish all traitors who would use
Our punctuation for shampoos,�
Said Jones, and died, �I did not know!�

Warning

Children: Think well of Jones�s fate
And learn, while young, to punctuate.
