Good King Arthur.


When good king Arthur ruled this land,
He was a goodly king;
He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
To make a bag-pudding.

A bag-pudding the king did make,
And stuffed it well with plums:
And in it put great lumps of fat,
As big as my two thumbs.










The king and queen did eat thereof,
And noblemen beside;
And what they could not eat that night,
The queen next morning fried.
