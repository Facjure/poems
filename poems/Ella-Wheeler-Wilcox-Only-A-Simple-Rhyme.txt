title: Only A Simple Rhyme.
---

 Only a simple rhyme of love and sorrow,
 Where "blisses" rhymed with "kisses," "heart," with "dart:"
 Yet, reading it, new strength I seemed to borrow,
 To live on bravely and to do my part.

 A little rhyme about a heart that's bleeding - 
 Of lonely hours and sorrow's unrelief:
 I smiled at first; but there came with the reading
 A sense of sweet companionship in grief.

 The selfishness of my own woe forsaking,
 I thought about the singer of that song.
 Some other breast felt this same weary aching;
 Another found the summer days too long.

 The few sad lines, my sorrow so expressing,
 I read, and on the singer, all unknown,
 I breathed a fervent though a silent blessing,
 And seemed to clasp his hand within my own.

 And though fame pass him and he never know it,
 And though he never sings another strain,
 He has performed the mission of the poet,
 In helping some sad heart to bear its pain.
