title: On The Death Of A Minister.

His master taken from his head,
Elisha saw him go;
And in desponding accents said,
�Ah, what must Israel do?�


But he forgot the Lord who lifts
The beggar to the throne;
Nor knew, that all Elijah�s gifts
Will soon be made his own.


What! when a Paul has run his course,
Or when Apollos dies,
Is Israel left without resource?
And have we no supplies?


Yes, while the dear Redeemer lives
We have a boundless store,
And shall be fed with what he gives,
Who lives for evermore.
