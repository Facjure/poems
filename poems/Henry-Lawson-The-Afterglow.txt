title: The Afterglow
---

Oh, for the fire that used to glow
In those my days of old!
I never thought a man could grow
So callous and so cold.
Ah, for the heart that used to ache
For those in sorrow�s ways;
I often wish my heart could break
As it did in those dead days.

Along my track of storm and stress,
And it is plain to trace,
I look back from the loneliness
And the depth of my disgrace.
�Twas fate and only fate I know,
But all mistakes are plain,
�Tis sadder than the afterglow,
More dreary than the rain.

But still there lies a patch of sun
That ne�er will come again,
Those golden days when I was one
Of Nature�s gentlemen.
And if there is a memory
Could break me down at last,
It sure would be the thought of this,
The sunshine in the past.

But �spite of sunshine on the track,
And well the sun might shine,
My heart grows hard when I look back
From these dark days of mine.
A nobler child was never born
In all the Southern land,
The slave of selfish ignorance
That could not understand.

Oh, I had lived for many years
In a world of my ideal,
With no false laughter, no false tears,
And it seemed very real.
But I was wakened from my dreams,
And learnt with hardening eyes
A world of selfish treachery,
Of paltry shame and lies.

I left the truest friends on earth
Who did not need my aid,
And worked for those who were not worth
The sacrifice I made.
And while I blindly strove to raise
The coward and the clown,
They sneaked behind by shady ways
And tore my palace down.

But let those faithless friends of mine
Who�d think of me with scorn,
Remember that for many years
A heavy load I�ve borne.
And my true friends when all is done,
And my sad soul is gone,
Will think of battles I have won
When I lead rivals on.

And though from spite and worldly things
I well should be exempt,
For little men and paltry men
I scarce can feel contempt.
They followed me with flattery
In the days when I was brave,
But for those who have been true to me
I�ll strike back from the grave!
