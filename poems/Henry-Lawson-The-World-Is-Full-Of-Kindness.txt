title: The World Is Full Of Kindness
---

The World is full of kindness,
And not the poor alone;
We Christians in our blindness
Bow down to hearts of stone;
The clever, bitter cynic,
Whose poisoned �soul� is dead,
And, like the rotten clinic,
Raves, helpless, on his bed.

The world is full of kindness,
But not the White alone;
The heathen in his blindness
Bows down to wood and stone;
But all men are his brothers,
In spite of all the �Powers,�
And the things he does for others
Shew whiter souls than ours.

The world is full of kindness,
But not the Lean alone;
The Fat man in his blindness
Bows down, and not to stone;
But when a friend�s in trouble,
And an honest friend at that,
Then I�d turn to the Fat man
In spite of all his fat.

The world is full of kindness
If it is let alone,
And men�s hearts in their blindness
Are neither ice nor stone.
In spite of all pretenses,
We get it from Above;
In spite of all defenses,
Red blood, kind hearts, and love.
