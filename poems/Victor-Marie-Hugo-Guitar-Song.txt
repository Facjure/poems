("Comment, disaient-ils.")

[XXIII., July 18, 1838.]


How shall we flee sorrow - flee sorrow? said he.
How, how! How shall we flee sorrow - flee sorrow? said he.
How - how - how? answered she.

How shall we see pleasure - see pleasure? said he.
How, how! How shall we see pleasure - see pleasure? said he.
Dream - dream - dream! answered she.

How shall we be happy - be happy? said he.
How, how! How shall we be happy - be happy? said he.
Love - love - love! whispered she.
