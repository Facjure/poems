 "Ahoy, and ahoy!"
'Twixt mocking and merry - 
 "Ahoy and ahoy, there,
Young man of the ferry!"
 She stood on the steps
In the watery gloom - 
 That Changeling - "Ahoy, there!"
She called him to come.
 He came on the green wave,
He came on the grey,
 Where stooped that sweet lady
That still summer's day.
 He fell in a dream
Of her beautiful face,
 As she sat on the thwart
And smiled in her place.
 No echo his oar woke,
Float silent did they,
 Past low-grazing cattle
In the sweet of the hay.
 And still in a dream
At her beauty sat he,
 Drifting stern foremost
Down - down to the sea.
 Come you, then: call,
When the twilight apace
 Brings shadow to brood
On the loveliest face;
 You shall hear o'er the water
Ring faint in the grey - 
 "Ahoy, and ahoy, there!"
And tremble away;
 "Ahoy, and ahoy!..."
And tremble away.
