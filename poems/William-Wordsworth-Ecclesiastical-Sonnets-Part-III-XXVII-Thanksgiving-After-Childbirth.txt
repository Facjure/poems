title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part III. - XXVII - Thanksgiving After Childbirth
---

 Woman! the Power who left his throne on high,
 And deigned to wear the robe of flesh we wear,
 The Power that thro' the straits of Infancy
 Did pass dependent on maternal care,
 His own humanity with Thee will share,
 Pleased with the thanks that in his People's eye
 Thou offerest up for safe Delivery
 From Childbirth's perilous throes. And should the Heir
 Of thy fond hopes hereafter walk inclined
 To courses fit to make a mother rue
 That ever he was born, a glance of mind
 Cast upon this observance may renew
 A better will; and, in the imagined view
 Of thee thus kneeling, safety he may find.
