 Over the hearth - my father's seat - 
 Repose, to patriot-memory dear,
 Thou tried companion, whom at last I greet
 By steepy banks of Hudson here.
 How oft I told thee of this scene - 
 The Highlands blue - the river's narrowing sheen.
 Little at Gettysburg we thought
 To find such haven; but God kept it green.
 Long rest! with belt, and bayonet, and canteen.
