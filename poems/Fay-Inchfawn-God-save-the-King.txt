GOD SAVE OUR GRACIOUS KING. (It seems
The Church is full of bygone dreams.)

LONG LIVE OUR NOBLE KING. (My own,
'Tis hard to stand here all alone.)

GOD SAVE THE KING. (But, sweetheart, you
Were always brave to dare and do.)

SEND HIM VICTORIOUS. (For then,
My darling will come home again!)

HAPPY AND GLORIOUS ('Twill be
Like Heaven to him -- and what to me?)

LONG TO REIGN OVER US. (My dear!
And we'd been wedded one short year!)

GOD SAVE OUR KING. (And Lord, I pray
Keep MY King safe this very day.)

Forgive us, thou -- great England's kingly King
That thus do women National Anthems sing.
