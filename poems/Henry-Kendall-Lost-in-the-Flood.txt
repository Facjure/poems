title: Lost in the Flood

When God drave the ruthless waters
From our cornfields to the sea,
Came she where our wives and daughters
Sobbed their thanks on bended knee.
Hidden faces! there ye found her
Mute as death, and staring wild
At the shadow waxing round her
Like the presence of her child
 Of her drenched and drowning child!

Dark thoughts live when tears won�t gather;
Who can tell us what she felt?
It was human, O my Father,
If she blamed Thee while she knelt!
Ever, as a benediction
Fell like balm on all and each,
Rose a young face whose affliction
Choked and stayed the founts of speech
Stayed and shut the founts of speech!

Often doth she sit and ponder
Over gleams of happy hair!
How her white hands used to wander,
Like a flood of moonlight there!
Lord our Lord! Thou know�st her weakness:
Give her faith that she may pray;
And the subtle strength of meekness,
Lest she falter by the way
Falter, fainting, by the way!

�Darling!� saith she, wildly moaning
Where the grass-grown silence lies,
�Is there rest from sobs and groaning
Rest with you beyond the skies?
Child of mine, so far above me!
Late it waxeth dark and late;
Will the love with which I love thee,
Lift me where you sit and wait
Darling! where you sit and wait?�
