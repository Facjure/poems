I.
Eh? good da�y! good da�y! thaw it be�n�t not mooch of a da�y,
Nasty, casselty (1) weather! an� mea Ha�fe down wi� my ha�y! (2)

II.
How be the farm gittin on? no�ways. Gittin on i�dee�d!
Why, tonups was Ha�fe on �em fingers an� toas, (3) an� the mare brokken-knee�d,
An� pigs didn�t sell at fall, (4) an� wa lost wer Haldeny cow,
An� it be�ts ma to knaw wot she died on, but wool�s looking oop ony how.

III.
An� so� they�ve ma�de tha a parson, an� thou�ll git along, niver fear,
Fur I be�n chuch-warden mysen i� the parish fur fifteen year.
Well�sin ther be� chuch-wardens, ther mun be parsons an� all,
An� if t��ne stick alongside t�uther (5) the chuch we�nt happen a fall.

IV.
Fur I wur a Baptis wonst, an� age�n the toithe an� the ra�te,
Till I fun (6) that it warn�t not the ga�inist (7) wa�y to the narra Ga�te.
An� I can�t abe�r �em, I can�t, fur a lot on �em coom�d ta-year (8)�
I wur down wi� the rheumatis then�to my pond to wesh thessens theere�
Sa I sticks like the ivin (9) as long as I lives to the owd chuch now,
Fur they wesh�d their sins i� my pond, an� I doubts they poison�d the cow.

V.
Ay, an� ya seed the Bishop. They say�s �at he coom�d fra nowt�
Burn i� tra�de. Sa I warrants �e niver said ha�fe wot �e thowt,
But �e cree�pt an� �e crawl�d along, till �e fee�ld �e could howd �is o�n,
Then �e married a gre�t Yerl�s darter, an� sits o� the Bishop�s throan.

VI.
Now I�ll gie the a bit o� my mind an� tha weant be taakin� offence,
Fur thou be a big scholard now wi� a hoonderd ha�cre o� sense�
But sich an obstropulous (10) lad�naay, naay�fur I minds tha sa well,
Tha�d niver not hopple (11) thy tongue, an� the tongue�s sit afire o� Hell,
As I says to my missis to-da�y, when she hurl�d a pla�te at the cat
An� anoother age�n my no�se. Ya was niver sa bad as that.

VII.
But I minds when i� Howlaby beck won da�y ya was ticklin� o� trout,
An� kee�per �e seed ya an roon�d, an� �e beal�d (12) to ya �Lad coom hout�
An� ya stood oop na�kt i� the beck, an� ya tell�d �im to knaw his awn pla�ce
An� ye call�d �im a clown, ya did, an� ya thraw�d the fish i� �is fa�ce,
An� �e torn�d (13) as red as a stag-tuckey�s (14) wattles, but theer an� then
I co�mb�d �im down, fur I promised ya�d niver not do it age�n.

VIII.
An� I cotch�d tha wonst i� my garden, when thou was a height-year-howd, (15)
An� I fun thy pockets as full o� my pippins as iver they�d �owd, (16)
An� thou was as pe�rky (17) as owt, an� tha ma�de me as mad as mad,
But I says to the �kee�p �em, an� welcome� fur thou was the Parson�s lad.

IX.
An Parson �e �ears on it all, an� then ta�kes kindly to me,
An� then I wur chose Chuch-warden an� coom�d to the top o� the tree,
Fur Quoloty�s hall my friends, an� they ma�kes ma a help to the poor,
When I gits the pla�te fuller o� Soondays nor ony chuch-warden afoor,
Fur if iver thy feyther�ed riled me I kep� mysen mee�k as a lamb,
An� saw by the Gra�ce o� the Lord, Mr. Harry, I ham wot I ham.

X.
But Parson �e will spe�k out, saw, now �e be sixty-seven,
He�ll niver swap Owlby an� Scratby fur owt but the Kingdom o� Heaven:
An� thou�II be �is Curate �ere, but, if iver tha me�ns to git �igher,
The mun tackle the sins o� the Wo�ld, (18) an� not the faults o� the Squire.
An� I reckons tha�ll light of a livin� some-wheers i� the Wowd (19) or the Fen,
If tha cottons down to thy betters, an� kee�ps thysen to thysen.
But niver not spe�k pla�in out, if tha wants to git forrards a bit,
But cree�p along the hedge-bottoms, an� thou�ll be a Bishop yit.

XI.
Na�y, but tha mun spe�k hout to the Baptises here i� the town,
Fur mo�st on �em talks age�n tithe, an� I�d like the to pre�ch �em down,
Fur they�ve bin a-pre�chin� mea down, they heve, an� I ha�tes �em now,
Fur they le�ved their nasty sins i� my pond, an� it poison�d the cow.
