A New Song, to a Tune never sung before.


I sing of a journey to Clifton,[1]
We would have performed, if we could;
Without cart or barrow, to lift on
Poor Mary[2] and me through the mud.
Slee, sla, slud,
Stuck in the mud;
Oh it is pretty to wade through a flood!


So away we went, slipping and sliding;
Hop, hop, � la mode de deux frogs;
�Tis near as good walking as riding,
When ladies are dressed in their clogs.
Wheels, no doubt,
Go briskly about,
But they clatter and rattle, and make such a rout.

she.
�Well! now, I protest it is charming;
How finely the weather improves!
That cloud, though �tis rather alarming,
How slowly and stately it moves.�
he.
�Pshaw! never mind,
�Tis not in the wind,
We are travelling south, and shall leave it behind.�
she.
�I am glad we are come for an airing,
For folks may be pounded, and penn�d,
Until they grow rusty, not caring
To stir half a mile to an end.�
he.
�The longer we stay,
The longer we may;
It�s a folly to think about weather or way.�
she.
�But now I begin to be frighted,
If I fall, what a way I should roll!
I am glad that the bridge was indicted,
Stay! stop! I am sunk in a hole!�
he.
�Nay never care,
�Tis a common affair;
You�ll not be the last that will set a foot there.�
she.
�Let me breathe now a little, and ponder
On what it were better to do;
That terrible lane I see yonder,
I think we shall never get through.�
he.
�So think I:�
But, by the bye,
We never shall know, if we never should try.�
she.
�But should we get there, how shall we get home
What a terrible deal of bad road we have past!
Slipping, and sliding, and if we should come
To a difficult stile, I am ruin�d at last!
Oh this lane!
Now it is plain
That struggling and striving is labour in vain.�
he.
�Stick fast there while I go and look;�
she.
�Don�t go away, for fear I should fall:�
he.
�I have examined it, every nook,
And what you see here is a sample of all.
Come, wheel round,
The dirt we have found
Would be an estate, at a farthing a pound.�


Now, sister Anne,[3] the guitar you must take,
Set it, and sing it, and make it a song:
I have varied the verse, for variety�s sake,
And cut it off short�because it was long.
�Tis hobbling and lame,
Which critics won�t blame,
For the sense and the sound, they say, should be the same.
