I.
WA�IT till our Sally cooms in, fur thou mun a� sights1 to tell.
Eh, but I be ma�in glad to see� tha sa �arty an� well.
�Cast awa�y on a disolut land wi� a vartical soon2!�
Strange fur to go� fur to think what sa�ilors a� see�n an� a� doon;
�Summat to drink�sa� �ot?� I �a nowt but Adam�s wine:
What�s the �e�t o� this little �ill-side to the �e�t o� the line?

II.
�What�s i� tha bottle a-stanning theer? I�ll tell tha. Gin.
But if thou wants thy grog, tha mun go� fur it down to the inn.
Naay�fur I be ma�in-glad, but thaw tha was iver sa dry,
Thou gits naw gin fro� the bottle theer, an� I�ll tell tha why.

III.
Me� an� thy sister was married, when wur it? back-end o� June,
Ten year sin�, and wa �greed as well as a fiddle i� tune:
I could fettle and clump owd boo�ts and shoes wi� the best on �em all,
As fer as fro� Thursby thurn hup to Harmsby and Hutterby Hall.
We was busy as bee�s i� the bloom an� �appy as �art could think,
An� then the babby wur burn, and then I ta�kes to the drink.

IV.
An� I weant ga�insa�y it, my lad, thaw I be hafe sha�med on it now,
We could sing a good song at the Plow, we could sing a good song at the Plow;
Thaw once of a frosty night I slither�d an hurted my huck,3
An� I coom�d neck-an-crop soomtimes sla�pe down i� the squad an� the muck:
An� once I fowt wi� the Ta�ilor�not hafe ov a man, my lad�
Fur he scrawm�d an� scratted my fa�ce like a cat, an� it ma�de�er sa mad
That Sally she turn�d a tongue-banger4 an� ra�ted ma, �Sottin� thy bra�ins
Guzzlin� an� so�kin� an� smo�kin� an� hawmin�5 about i� the la�nes,
So� sow-droonk that tha doesn not touch thy �at to the Squire;�
An� I loo�k�d cock-eyed at my no�se an� I see�d �im a-gittin� o� fire;
But sin� I wur hallus i� liquor an� hallus as droonk as a king,
Fo�lks� coostom flitted awa�y like a kite wi� a brokken string.

V.
An� Sally she wesh�d fo�lks� clo�ths to keep the wolf fro� the door,
Eh but the moor she riled me, she druv me to drink the moor,
Fur I fun�, when �er hack wur turn�d, wheer Sally�s owd stockin� wur �id,
An� I grabb�d the munny she ma�de, and I we�r�d it o� liquor, I did.

VI.
An� one night I cooms �o�m like a bull gotten loose at a fa�ir,
An� she wur a-wa�itin� fo�mma, an� cryin� and te�rin� �er �a�ir,
An� I tummled athurt the cra�dle an� swe�r�d as I�d break ivry stick
O� furnitur �ere i� the �ouse, an� I gied our Sally a kick,
An� I mash�d the ta�bles an� chairs, an� she an� the babby be�l�d,6
Fur I knaw�d naw moor what I did nor a mortal be�st o� the fe�ld.

VII.
An� when I wa�ked i� the murnin� I see�d that our Sally went la�med
Cos� o� the kick as I gied �er, an� I wur dreadful asha�med;
An� Sally wur sloomy7 an� draggle ta�il�d in an owd turn gown,
An� the babby�s fa�ce wurn�t wesh�d an� the �ole �ouse hupside down.

VIII.
An� then I minded our Sally sa patty an� ne�t an� swee�t,
Strait as a pole an� cle�n as a flower fro� �ead to fee�t:
An� then I minded the fust kiss I gied �er by Thursby thurn;
Theer wur a lark a-singin� �is best of a Sunday at murn,
Couldn�t see �im, we �e�rd �im a-mountin� oop �igher an� �igher,
An� then �e turn�d to the sun, an� �e shined like a sparkle o� fire.
�Doesn�t tha see �im,� she axes, �fur I can see �im?� an� I
See�d nobbut the smile o� the sun as danced in �er pratty blue eye;
An� I says �I mun gie tha a kiss,� an� Sally says �No�, thou mo�nt,�
But I gied �er a kiss, an� then anoother, an� Sally says �do�nt!�

IX.
An� when we coom�d into Mee�tin�, at fust she wur all in a tew,
But, arter, we sing�d the �ymn togither like birds on a beugh;
An� Muggins �e pre�ch�d o� Hell-fire an� the loov o� God fur men,
An� then upo� coomin� awa�y Sally gied me a kiss ov �ersen.

X.
Heer wur a fall fro� a kiss to a kick like Sa�tan as fell
Down out o� heaven i� hell-fire�thaw theer�s naw drinkin� i� Hell;
Me� fur to kick our Sally as kep the wolf fro� the door,
All along o� the drink, fur I loov�d �er as well as afoor.

XI.
Sa like a gre�t num-cumpus I blubber�d awa�y o� the bed�
�We�nt niver do it naw moor;� an� Sally loookt up an� she said,
�I�ll upowd it8 tha we�nt; thou�rt like the rest o� the men,
Thou�ll go� sniffin� about the tap till tha does it ag�an.
Theer�s thy hennemy, man, an� I knaws, as knaws tha sa well,
That, if tha see�s �im an� smells �im tha�ll foller �im slick into Hell.�

XII.
�Na�y,� says I, �fur I we�nt go� sniffin� about the tap.�
�We�nt tha?� she says, an� mysen I thowt i� mysen �mayhap.�
�No�:� an� I started awa�y like a shot, an� down to the Hinn,
An� I browt what tha see�s stannin� theer, yon big black bottle o� gin.

XIII.
�That caps owt,�9 says Sally, an� saw she begins to cry,
But I puts it inter �er �ands an� I says to �er, �Sally,� says I,
�Stan� �im theer i� the na�me o� the Lord an� the power ov �is Gra�ce,
Stan� �im theer, fur I�ll loo�k my hennemy strait i� the fa�ce,
Stan� �im theer i� the winder, an� let ma loo�k at �im then,
�E see�ms naw moor nor watter, an� �e�s the Divil�s o�n sen.�

XIV.
An� I wur down i� tha mouth, couldn�t do naw work an� all,
Nasty an� snaggy an� sha�ky, an� poonch�d my �and wi� the hawl,
But she wur a power o� coomfut, an� sattled �ersen o� my knee,
An� co�xd an� coodled me oop till age�n I feel�d mysen free.

XV.
An� Sally she tell�d it about, an� fo�lk stood a-gawmin�10 in,
As thaw it wur summat bewitch�d istead of a quart o� gin;
An� some on �em said it wur watter�an� I wur chousin� the wife,
Fur I couldn�t �owd �ands off gin, wur it nobbut to sa�ve my life;
An� blacksmith �e strips me the thick ov �is airm, an� �e shaws it to me,
Fee�l thou this! thou can�t graw this upo� watter!� says he.
An� Doctor �e calls o� Sunday an� just as candles was lit,
�Thou mo�nt do it,� he says, �tha mun break �im off bit by bit.�
�Thou�rt but a Methody-man,� says Parson, and la�ys down �is �at,
An� �e points to the bottle o� gin, �but I respeeks tha fur that;�
An� Squire, his o�n very sen, walks down fro� the �All to see,
An� �e spanks �is �and into mine, �fur I respecks tha,� says �e;
An� coostom age�n draw�d in like a wind fro� far an� wide,
And browt me the boo�ts to be cobbled fro� hafe the coontryside.

XVI.
An� theer �e stans an� theer �e shall stan to my dying da�y;
I �a gotten to loov �im age�n in anoother kind of a wa�y,
Proud on �im, like, my lad, an� I kee�ps �im cle�n an� bright,
Loovs �im, an� roobs �im, an� doosts �im, an� puts �im back i� the light.

XVII.
Wouldn�t a pint a� sarved as well as a quart? Naw doubt:
But I liked a bigger fetter to fight wi� an fowt it out.
Fine an� meller �e mun be by this, if I cared to ta�ste,
But I mo�nt, my lad, and I we�nt, fur I�d fe�l mysen cle�n disgra�ced.

XVIII.
An� once I said to the Missis, �My lass, when I cooms to die,
Smash the bottle to smithers, the Divil�s in �im,� said I.
But arter I cha�nged my mind, an� if Sally be left alo�n,
I�ll hev �im a-buried wi�mma an� ta�kt �im afoor the Thro�n.

XIX.
Coom thou �eer�yon la�dy a-steppin along the stree�t,
Doesn�t tha knaw �er�sa pratty, an� fe�t, an� ne�t, an� swee�t?
Look at the clo�ths on �er back, thebbe ammost spick-span-new,
An� Tommy�s fa�ce be as fresh as a codlin wesh�d i� the dew.

XX.
�Ere he our Sally an� Tommy, an� we be a-goin to dine,
Ba�con an� ta�tes, an� a beslings-pud-din�11 an� Adam�s wine;
But if tha wants ony grog tha mun go� fur it down to the Hinn,
Fur I we�nt shed a drop on �is blood, no�, not fur Sally�s o�n kin.
