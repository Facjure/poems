 1.

 WHAT though my words glance sideways from the thing
 Which I would utter in thine ear, my sire!
 Truth in the inward parts thou dost desire--
 Wise hunger, not a fitness fine of speech:
 The little child that clamouring fails to reach
 With upstretched hand the fringe of her attire,
 Yet meets the mother's hand down hurrying.

 2.

 Even when their foolish words they turned on him,
 He did not his disciples send away;
 He knew their hearts were foolish, eyes were dim,
 And therefore by his side needs must they stay.
 Thou will not, Lord, send me away from thee.
 When I am foolish, make thy cock crow grim;
 If that is not enough, turn, Lord, and look on me.

 3.

 Another day of gloom and slanting rain!
 Of closed skies, cold winds, and blight and bane!
 Such not the weather, Lord, which thou art fain
 To give thy chosen, sweet to heart and brain!--
 Until we mourn, thou keep'st the merry tune;
 Thy hand unloved its pleasure must restrain,
 Nor spoil both gift and child by lavishing too soon.

 4.

 But all things shall be ours! Up, heart, and sing.
 All things were made for us--we are God's heirs--
 Moon, sun, and wildest comets that do trail
 A crowd of small worlds for a swiftness-tail!
 Up from Thy depths in me, my child-heart bring--
 The child alone inherits anything:
 God's little children-gods--all things are theirs!

 5.

 Thy great deliverance is a greater thing
 Than purest imagination can foregrasp;
 A thing beyond all conscious hungering,
 Beyond all hope that makes the poet sing.
 It takes the clinging world, undoes its clasp,
 Floats it afar upon a mighty sea,
 And leaves us quiet with love and liberty and thee.

 6.

 Through all the fog, through all earth's wintery sighs,
 I scent Thy spring, I feel the eternal air,
 Warm, soft, and dewy, filled with flowery eyes,
 And gentle, murmuring motions everywhere--
 Of life in heart, and tree, and brook, and moss;
 Thy breath wakes beauty, love, and bliss, and prayer,
 And strength to hang with nails upon thy cross.

 7.

 If thou hadst closed my life in seed and husk,
 And cast me into soft, warm, damp, dark mould,
 All unaware of light come through the dusk,
 I yet should feel the split of each shelly fold,
 Should feel the growing of my prisoned heart,
 And dully dream of being slow unrolled,
 And in some other vagueness taking part.

 8.

 And little as the world I should foreknow
 Up into which I was about to rise--
 Its rains, its radiance, airs, and warmth, and skies,
 How it would greet me, how its wind would blow--
 As little, it may be, I do know the good
 Which I for years half darkling have pursued--
 The second birth for which my nature cries.

 9.

 The life that knows not, patient waits, nor longs:--
 I know, and would be patient, yet would long.
 I can be patient for all coming songs,
 But let me sing my one monotonous song.
 To me the time is slow my mould among;
 To quicker life I fain would spur and start
 The aching growth at my dull-swelling heart.

 10.

 Christ is the pledge that I shall one day see;
 That one day, still with him, I shall awake,
 And know my God, at one with him and free.
 O lordly essence, come to life in me;
 The will-throb let me feel that doth me make;
 Now have I many a mighty hope in thee,
 Then shall I rest although the universe should quake.

 11.

 Haste to me, Lord, when this fool-heart of mine
 Begins to gnaw itself with selfish craving;
 Or, like a foul thing scarcely worth the saving,
 Swoln up with wrath, desireth vengeance fine.
 Haste, Lord, to help, when reason favours wrong;
 Haste when thy soul, the high-born thing divine,
 Is torn by passion's raving, maniac throng.

 12.

 Fair freshness of the God-breathed spirit air,
 Pass through my soul, and make it strong to love;
 Wither with gracious cold what demons dare
 Shoot from my hell into my world above;
 Let them drop down, like leaves the sun doth sear,
 And flutter far into the inane and bare,
 Leaving my middle-earth calm, wise, and clear.

 13.

 Even thou canst give me neither thought nor thing,
 Were it the priceless pearl hid in the land,
 Which, if I fix thereon a greedy gaze,
 Becomes not poison that doth burn and cling;
 Their own bad look my foolish eyes doth daze,
 They see the gift, see not the giving hand--
 From the living root the apple dead I wring.

 14.

 This versing, even the reading of the tale
 That brings my heart its joy unspeakable,
 Sometimes will softly, unsuspectedly hale
 That heart from thee, and all its pulses quell.
 Discovery's pride, joy's bliss, take aback my sail,
 And sweep me from thy presence and my grace,
 Because my eyes dropped from the master's face.

 15.

 Afresh I seek thee. Lead me--once more I pray--
 Even should it be against my will, thy way.
 Let me not feel thee foreign any hour,
 Or shrink from thee as an estranged power.
 Through doubt, through faith, through bliss, through stark dismay,
 Through sunshine, wind, or snow, or fog, or shower,
 Draw me to thee who art my only day.

 16.

 I would go near thee--but I cannot press
 Into thy presence--it helps not to presume.
 Thy doors are deeds; the handles are their doing.
 He whose day-life is obedient righteousness,
 Who, after failure, or a poor success,
 Rises up, stronger effort yet renewing--
 He finds thee, Lord, at length, in his own common room.

 17.

 Lord, thou hast carried me through this evening's duty;
 I am released, weary, and well content.
 O soul, put on the evening dress of beauty,
 Thy sunset-flush, of gold and purple blent!--
 Alas, the moment I turn to my heart,
 Feeling runs out of doors, or stands apart!
 But such as I am, Lord, take me as thou art.

 18.

 The word he then did speak, fits now as then,
 For the same kind of men doth mock at it.
 God-fools, God-drunkards these do call the men
 Who think the poverty of their all not fit,
 Borne humbly by their art, their voice, their pen,
 Save for its allness, at thy feet to fling,
 For whom all is unfit that is not everything.

 19.

 O Christ, my life, possess me utterly.
 Take me and make a little Christ of me.
 If I am anything but thy father's son,
 'Tis something not yet from the darkness won.
 Oh, give me light to live with open eyes.
 Oh, give me life to hope above all skies.
 Give me thy spirit to haunt the Father with my cries.

 20.

 'Tis hard for man to rouse his spirit up--
 It is the human creative agony,
 Though but to hold the heart an empty cup,
 Or tighten on the team the rigid rein.
 Many will rather lie among the slain
 Than creep through narrow ways the light to gain--
 Than wake the will, and be born bitterly.

 21.

 But he who would be born again indeed,
 Must wake his soul unnumbered times a day,
 And urge himself to life with holy greed;
 Now ope his bosom to the Wind's free play;
 And now, with patience forceful, hard, lie still,
 Submiss and ready to the making will,
 Athirst and empty, for God's breath to fill.

 22.

 All times are thine whose will is our remede.
 Man turns to thee, thou hast not turned away;
 The look he casts, thy labour that did breed--
 It is thy work, thy business all the day:
 That look, not foregone fitness, thou dost heed.
 For duty absolute how be fitter than now?
 Or learn by shunning?--Lord, I come; help thou.

 23.

 Ever above my coldness and my doubt
 Rises up something, reaching forth a hand:
 This thing I know, but cannot understand.
 Is it the God in me that rises out
 Beyond my self, trailing it up with him,
 Towards the spirit-home, the freedom-land,
 Beyond my conscious ken, my near horizon's brim?

 24.

 O God of man, my heart would worship all
 My fellow men, the flashes from thy fire;
 Them in good sooth my lofty kindred call,
 Born of the same one heart, the perfect sire;
 Love of my kind alone can set me free;
 Help me to welcome all that come to me,
 Not close my doors and dream solitude liberty!

 25.

 A loving word may set some door ajar
 Where seemed no door, and that may enter in
 Which lay at the heart of that same loving word.
 In my still chamber dwell thou always, Lord;
 Thy presence there will carriage true afford;
 True words will flow, pure of design to win;
 And to my men my door shall have no bar.

 26.

 My prayers, my God, flow from what I am not;
 I think thy answers make me what I am.
 Like weary waves thought follows upon thought,
 But the still depth beneath is all thine own,
 And there thou mov'st in paths to us unknown.
 Out of strange strife thy peace is strangely wrought;
 If the lion in us pray--thou answerest the lamb.

 27.

 So bound in selfishness am I, so chained,
 I know it must be glorious to be free
 But know not what, full-fraught, the word doth mean.
 By loss on loss I have severely gained
 Wisdom enough my slavery to see;
 But liberty, pure, absolute, serene,
 No freï¿½st-visioned slave has ever seen.

 28.

 For, that great freedom how should such as I
 Be able to imagine in such a self?
 Less hopeless far the miser man might try
 To image the delight of friend-shared pelf.
 Freedom is to be like thee, face and heart;
 To know it, Lord, I must be as thou art,
 I cannot breed the imagination high.

 29.

 Yet hints come to me from the realm unknown;
 Airs drift across the twilight border land,
 Odoured with life; and as from some far strand
 Sea-murmured, whispers to my heart are blown
 That fill me with a joy I cannot speak,
 Yea, from whose shadow words drop faint and weak:
 Thee, God, I shadow in that region grand.

 30.

 O Christ, who didst appear in Judah land,
 Thence by the cross go back to God's right hand,
 Plain history, and things our sense beyond,
 In thee together come and correspond:
 How rulest thou from the undiscovered bourne
 The world-wise world that laughs thee still to scorn?
 Please, Lord, let thy disciple understand.

 31.

 'Tis heart on heart thou rulest. Thou art the same
 At God's right hand as here exposed to shame,
 And therefore workest now as thou didst then--
 Feeding the faint divine in humble men.
 Through all thy realms from thee goes out heart-power,
 Working the holy, satisfying hour,
 When all shall love, and all be loved again.
