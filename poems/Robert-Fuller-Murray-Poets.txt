Children of earth are we,
Lovers of land and sea,
Of hill, of brook, of tree,
 Of all things fair;
Of all things dark or bright,
Born of the day and night,
Red rose and lily white
 And dusky hair.

Yet not alone from earth
Do we derive our birth.
What were our singing worth
 Were this the whole?
Somewhere from heaven afar
Hath dropped a fiery star,
Which makes us what we are,
 Which is our soul.
