For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God. Ephesians 2:8.


Christ might have called the angels down
To bear him safe above,
To shield his brow from sorrow's crown,
From death's cold blight, and bitter frown,
Had it not been for love.

Our glorious King, our Prince of Peace,
Has left his throne above
To give our souls from sin release,
To make our pain and anguish cease,
And all because of love.

By faith in him, we all may see
In realms of light above,
Through streams of blood on Calvary,
A joyful immortality; 
The purchase price was love.
