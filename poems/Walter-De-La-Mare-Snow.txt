 No breath of wind,
 No gleam of sun - 
 Still the white snow
 Swirls softly down - 
 Twig and bough
 And blade and thorn
 All in an icy
 Quiet, forlorn.
 Whispering, nestling,
 Through the air,
 On sill and stone,
 Roof - everywhere,
 It heaps its powdery
 Crystal flakes,
 Of every tree
 A mountain makes:
 Till pale and faint
 At shut of day,
 Stoops from the West
 One wintry ray.
 Then, feathered in fire,
 Where ghosts the moon,
 A robin shrills
 His lonely tune;
 And from her dark-gnarled
 Yew-tree lair
 Flits she who had been
 In hiding there.
