 Into the golden vessel of great song
 Let us pour all our passion; breast to breast
 Let other lovers lie, in love and rest;
 Not we,--articulate, so, but with the tongue
 Of all the world: the churning blood, the long
 Shuddering quiet, the desperate hot palms pressed
 Sharply together upon the escaping guest,
 The common soul, unguarded, and grown strong.
 Longing alone is singer to the lute;
 Let still on nettles in the open sigh
 The minstrel, that in slumber is as mute
 As any man, and love be far and high,
 That else forsakes the topmost branch, a fruit
 Found on the ground by every passer-by.
