title: Drouth In Autumn
---

Gnarled acorn-oaks against a west
 Of copper, cavernous with fire;
A wind of frost that gives no rest
 To such lean leaves as haunt the brier,
 And hide the cricket's vibrant wire.

Sear, shivering shocks, and stubble blurred
 With bramble-blots of dull maroon;
And creekless hills whereon no herd
 Finds pasture, and whereo'er the loon
 Flies, haggard as the rainless moon.
