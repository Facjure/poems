A.
Hark, neighbor, for one moment stay!
Herr Doctor Scalpel, so they say,
 Has got off safe and sound;
 At Paris I your uncle found
 Fast to a horse's crupper bound,
Yet Scalpel made a king his prey.

B.
Oh, dear me, no! A real misnomer!
The fact is, he has his diploma;
 The other one has not.

A.
Eh? What? Has a diploma?
 In Suabia may such things be got?
