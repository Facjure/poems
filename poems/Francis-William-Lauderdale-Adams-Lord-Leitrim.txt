 My Lord, at last you have it! Now we know
 Truth's not a phrase, justice an idle show.
 Your life ran red with murder, green with lust.
 Blood has washed blood clean, and, in the final dust
 Your carrion will be purified. Yet, see,
 Though your body perish, for your soul shall be
 An immortality of infamy!
