title: On The Benefit Received By His Majesty From Sea-Bathing In The Year 1789.

O sovereign of an isle renown�d
For undisputed sway,
Wherever o�er yon gulf profound
Her navies wing their way,


With juster claims she builds at length
Her empire on the sea,
And well may boast the waves her strength,
Which strength restored to thee.
