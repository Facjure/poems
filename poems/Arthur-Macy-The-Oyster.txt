title: The Oyster
---

 Two halves of an oyster shell, each a shallow cup;
 Here once lived an oyster before they ate him up.
 Oyster shells are smooth inside; outside very rough;
 Very little room to spare, but he had enough.
 Bedroom, parlor, kitchen, or cellar there was none;
 Just one room in all the house - oysters need but one.
 And he was never troubled by wind or rain or snow,
 For he had a roof above, another one below.
 I wonder if they fried him, or cooked him in a stew,
 And sold him at a fair, and passed him off for two.
 I wonder if the oysters all have names like us,
 And did he have a name like "John" or "Romulus"?
 I wonder if his parents wept to see him go;
 I wonder who can tell; perhaps the mermaids know.
 I wonder if our sleep the most of us would dread,
 If we slept like oysters, a million in a bed!
