Luck is the tuning of our inmost thought
 To chord with God's great plan.
That done, ah! know,
Thy silent wishes to results shall grow,
And day by day shall miracles be wrought.
Once let thy being selflessly be brought
 To chime with universal good, and lo!
 What music from the spheres shall through thee flow!
What benefits shall come to thee unsought!

Shut out the noise of traffic!Rise above
 The body's clamour!With the soul's fine ear
Attune thyself to harmonies divine -
All, all are written in the key of Love.
 Keep to the score, and thou hast naught to fear;
Achievements yet undreamed of shall be thine.
