title: The Statue Of Our Queen

Pride, selfishness in every line,
And on its face a frown,
It stands, a sceptre in its hand,
And points forever down.
And who will kneel? The unemployed!
Small homage pay, I ween,
The only men who gather �neath
The Statue of our Queen.

I�d scarcely wonder if the sun,
That rises with good grace,
Should sink and leave the day undone
At sight of such a face.
But no! The day will still have birth
In all its golden sheen,
When antiquarians unearth
The Statue of our Queen.

Then if you�d have us loyal bide
As we have loyal been,
Great Parkes! for love of England, hide
The Statue of our Queen.
