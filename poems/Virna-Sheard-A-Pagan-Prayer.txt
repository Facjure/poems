Lord of all Life! When my hours are done,
 Take me and make me anew - 
And give me back to the earth and the sun,
 And the sky's unlimited blue.

The nightingale sings in an ecstasy
 To the moonlit April night,
But my songs are locked in the heart of me,
 Like birds that may not take flight.

The little purple-winged swallows that fly
 Through waves of the upper air,
Have a sweeter liberty, Lord, than I,
 Who may not follow them there.

Pavilions of sunshine - tents of the rain,
 For these, the wild and the free;
And for us walled garden and window-pane,
 And bolt and staple and key.

We are worn with wisdom that never brings
 Peace to the world and its woe - 
For a space with Thy joyous lesser things,
 Teach me the faith I would know.
