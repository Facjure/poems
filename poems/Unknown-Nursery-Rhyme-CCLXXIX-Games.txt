Dance, Thumbkin, dance,
[Keep the thumb in motion.
Dance, ye merrymen, every one:
[All the fingers in motion.
For Thumbkin, he can dance alone,
[The thumb only moving.
Thumbkin, he can dance alone,
[Ditto.
Dance, Foreman, dance,
[The first finger moving.
Dance, ye merrymen, every one;
[The whole moving.
But Foreman, he can dance alone,
Foreman, he can dance alone.

[and So on With the Others - naming the 2d Finger Longman - the 3d Finger Ringman - and the 4th Finger Littleman. Littleman Cannot Dance Alone.]
