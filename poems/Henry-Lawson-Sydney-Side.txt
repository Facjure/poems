Where's the steward?, Bar-room steward? Berth? Oh, any berth will do,
I have left a three-pound billet just to come along with you.
Brighter shines the Star of Rovers on a world that�s growing wide,
But I think I�d give a kingdom for a glimpse of Sydney-Side.

Run of rocky shelves at sunrise, with their base on ocean�s bed;
Homes of Coogee, homes of Bondi, and the lighthouse on South Head.
For in loneliness and hardship, and with just a touch of pride,
Has my heart been taught to whisper, �You belong to Sydney-Side.�

Oh, there never dawned a morning, in the long and lonely days,
But I thought I saw the ferries streaming out across the bays,
And as fresh and fair in fancy did the picture rise again
As the sunrise flushed the city from Woollahra to Balmain:

And the sunny water frothing round the liners black and red,
And the coastal schooners working by the loom of Bradley�s Head;
And the whistles and the sirens that re-echo far and wide,
All the life and light and beauty that belong to Sydney-Side.

And the dreary cloud-line never veiled the end of one day more,
But the city set in jewels rose before me from �The Shore.�
Round the sea-world shine the beacons of a thousand ports o� call,
But the harbour-lights of Sydney are the grandest of them all!

Toiling out beyond Coolgardie, heart and back and spirit broke,
Where the Rover�s Star gleams redly in the desert by the �soak�,
But says one mate to the other, �Brace your lip and do not fret,
We will laugh on trains and �buses, Sydney�s in the same place yet.�

Working in the South in winter, to the waist in dripping fern,
Where the local spirit hungers for each �saxpence� that we earn,
We can stand it for a season, for our world is growing wide,
And they all are friends and strangers who belong to Sydney-Side.

�T�other-siders! T�other-siders!� Yet we wake the dusty dead;
It is we that send the backward province fifty years ahead;
We it is that �trim� Australia, making narrow country wide,
Yet we�re always T�other-siders till we sail for Sydney-side.
