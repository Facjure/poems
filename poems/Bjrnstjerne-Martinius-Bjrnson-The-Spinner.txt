 Oh, what was it he meant
By his question as he went?
 "I am making a loom,
'T will be up in April's bloom;
 If you think it may be,
 Spin for me!"

 Oh, what shall I believe?
Does he think himself to weave?
 And the yarn that I spin,
Lo, he thinks to weave it in?
 And so soon as the Spring
 Flowers shall bring?

 And he laughed when he'd done;
Oh, he is so full of fun.
 Dare I trust all my skein
To so young and wild a swain? - 
 May God help to bind in
 All I spin!
