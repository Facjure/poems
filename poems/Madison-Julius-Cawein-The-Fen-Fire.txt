 The misty rain makes dim my face,
 The night's black cloak is o'er me;
 I tread the dripping cypress-place,
 A flickering light before me.

 Out of the death of leaves that rot
 And ooze and weedy water,
 My form was breathed to haunt this spot,
 Death's immaterial daughter.

 The owl that whoops upon the yew,
 The snake that lairs within it,
 Have seen my wild face flashing blue
 For one fantastic minute.

 But should you follow where my eyes
 Like some pale lamp decoy you,
 Beware! lest suddenly I rise
 With love that shall destroy you.
