An� SO �e�s dead in London,
An� answered to the call,
An� trotted through the Long Street,
With �earse an� plumes an� all?
We was village boys an� brothers,
We was warm as we could be,
In the milk-walk an� the fried fish,
Up in London, �im an� me.

We was warm,
We was warm,
As we �ad always been;
We never �ad a dry word
Till she come between.

I lived round Windsor Terrace,
An� �im across the wye,
An� when I sailed a emigrant
We never said good-bye!
He wos better than a brother,
Wot you Bushmen call a mate.
(Did he reach the rylwye stytion,
As they told me, just too late!)

We was warm,
We was warm,
As pals was ever seen;
We never �ad a dry word
Till she come between.

I meant to go back �ome again,
I meant to write to-night;
I meant to write by every mail,
But I thought �e oughter write.
An� now �e�s left North London,
For a better place, perhaps,
She�s flauntin� in �er widder weeds,
With eyes on other chaps.

We was warm,
We was warm,
As we �ad always been;
We never �ad a dry word
Till she come between.

Oh! tongues is bad in wimmin,
When wimmin�s tongues is bad!
For they�ll part men an� brothers
World oceans wide, my lad!
There was seven years between us,
An� fifteen thousand mile,
An� now there�s death an� sorrer
For ever an� awhile.

We was warm,
We was warm,
As two was ever seen;
We never �ad a dry word
Till she come between.
