[1]

 Upon a tree there mounted guard
 A veteran cock, adroit and cunning;
 When to the roots a fox up running,
 Spoke thus, in tones of kind regard: - 
 'Our quarrel, brother, 's at an end;
 Henceforth I hope to live your friend;
 For peace now reigns
 Throughout the animal domains.
 I bear the news: - come down, I pray,
 And give me the embrace fraternal;
 And please, my brother, don't delay.
 So much the tidings do concern all,
 That I must spread them far to-day.
 Now you and yours can take your walks
 Without a fear or thought of hawks.
 And should you clash with them or others,
 In us you'll find the best of brothers; - 
 For which you may, this joyful night,
 Your merry bonfires light.
 But, first, let's seal the bliss
 With one fraternal kiss.'
 'Good friend,' the cock replied, 'upon my word,
 A better thing I never heard;
 And doubly I rejoice
 To hear it from your voice;
 And, really there must be something in it,
 For yonder come two greyhounds, which I flatter
 Myself are couriers on this very matter.
 They come so fast, they'll be here in a minute.
 I'll down, and all of us will seal the blessing
 With general kissing and caressing.'
 'Adieu,' said fox; 'my errand's pressing;
 I'll hurry on my way,
 And we'll rejoice some other day.'
 So off the fellow scamper'd, quick and light,
 To gain the fox-holes of a neighbouring height,
 Less happy in his stratagem than flight.
 The cock laugh'd sweetly in his sleeve; - 
 'Tis doubly sweet deceiver to deceive.
