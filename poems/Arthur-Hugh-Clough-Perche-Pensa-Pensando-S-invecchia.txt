title: Perche Pensa? Pensando S'invecchia
---

To spend uncounted years of pain,
Again, again, and yet again,
In working out in heart and brain
The problem of our being here;
To gather facts from far and near,
Upon the mind to hold them clear,
And, knowing more may yet appear,
Unto one�s latest breath to fear
The premature result to draw�
Is this the object, end and law,
And purpose of our being here?
