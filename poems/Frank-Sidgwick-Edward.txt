The Text is that given by Percy in the Reliques (1765), with the substitution of w for initial qu, and y for initial z, as in Young Waters (see p. 146). In the fourth edition of the Reliques Percy states that 'this curious song was transmitted to the editor by Sir David Dalrymple, Bart., late Lord Hailes.'

Percy's adoption of antique spelling in this ballad has caused some doubt to be thrown on its authenticity; but there is also a version Son Davie, given in his Minstrelsy by Motherwell, who, in referring to the version in the Reliques, said there was reason for believing that Lord Hailes 'made a few slight verbal improvements in the copy he transmitted, and altered the hero's name to Edward, a name which, by the bye, never occurs in a Scottish ballad except where allusion is made to an English king.'

The Story has a close parallel in Swedish, the form of the ballad remaining in dialogue.

Motherwell points out that the verses of which Edward consists generally form the conclusion of the ballad of The Twa Brothers, and also of certain versions of Lizie Wan; and is inclined to regard Edward as detached from one of those ballads. More probably the reverse is the case, that the story of Edward has been attached to the other ballads.

The present version of the ballad exhibits an unusual amplification of the refrain. The story is told in two lines of each eight-lined stanza; but the lyrical effect added by the elaborate refrain is almost unique.

'Why dois your brand sae drap wi' bluid,
Edward, Edward?
Why dois your brand sae drap wi' bluid,
