I held my way through Defton Wood,
And on to Wandor Hall;
The dancing leaf let down the light,
In hovering spots to fall.
"O young, young leaves, you match me well,"
My heart was merry, and sung - 
"Now wish me joy of my sweet youth;
My love - she, too, is young!
O so many, many, many
 Little homes above my head!
O so many, many, many
 Dancing blossoms round me spread!
O so many, many, many
 Maidens sighing yet for none!
Speed, ye wooers, speed with any - 
 Speed with all but one."

I took my leave of Wandor Hall,
And trod the woodland ways.
"What shall I do so long to bear
The burden of my days?"
I sighed my heart into the boughs
Whereby the culvers cooed;
For only I between them went
Unwooing and unwooed.
"O so many, many, many
 Lilies bending stately heads!
O so many, many, many
 Strawberries ripened on their beds!
O so many, many, many
 Maids, and yet my heart undone!
What to me are all, are any - 
 I have lost my - one."
