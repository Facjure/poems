(DIED OF OVER-EXERTION AS VOLUNTEER MILITARY-SURGEON, 1864)

He gave heed to no Great Power
 But the one that God we call.
Hastening on to death's high hour,
 He before asked not the Gaul,
Nor the Briton, nor the others,
 If he too had leave to die
In the battle of his brothers
 Underneath the Danish sky.
 First to act with ardor youthful,
First a strong, clear faith to show,
 First to swear in spirit truthful,
First o'er death's dark bridge to go.

Knowing not, in times so trying
 None would come but he alone,
Thus he struggled, death defying,
 For the sacred things we own.
He of thousands here remaining
 Single would the name redeem,
Sank then with his zeal unwaning
 Down beneath death's silent stream.
First of souls in hope believing,
 Freedom's right 'gainst wrong to wield,
First warm drop, full-flowing, cleaving,
 Of our blood on Denmark's shield.
