title: Forward, Canada!
---

Northland of our birth and rearing,
Bound to us by ties endearing, - 
Forward ever, nothing fearing!
Forward, Canada!

Hear thy children's acclamations!
Vanquish trials and vexations!
Higher rise among the nations!
Forward, Canada!

Not by battles fierce and gory,
Not by conquest's hollow glory,
Need'st thou live in deathless story:
Forward, Canada!

Not by might and not by power, - -
Truth shall be thy fortress tower;
Arts of peace shall be thy flower:
Forward, Canada!

Yet if tyrant foe should ever
'Gainst thee come with base endeavor,
Strike, and yield thy freedom never:
Forward, Canada!
