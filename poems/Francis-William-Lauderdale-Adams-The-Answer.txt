 "Men and boys, O fathers, brothers,
Burst these fetters round you bound!
 Women, sisters, wives and mothers,
Lift your faces from the ground!

 "O Democracy, O People,
East and West and North and South,
 Rise together, one for ever,
Strike this Crime upon the mouth!

 "Bid them not, the men who loved you,
Those who fought for you and died,
 Scorn you that you broke a small Crime,
Left a great Crime pass in pride!

 "England, France, the played-out countries,
Let them reek there in their stew,
 Let their past rot out their present,
But the Future is with you!

 "O America, O first-born
Of the age that yet shall be
 Where all men shall be as one man,
Noble, faithful, fearless, free! - 

 "O America, O paramour
Of the foul slave-owner Pelf,
 You who saved from slavery others,
Now from slavery save yourself!

 "Save yourself, though, anguish-shaken,
You cry out and bow your head,
 Crying 'Why am I forsaken?'
Crying 'It is finished!'

 "Save yourself, no God will save you;
Not one angel can He give!
 They and He are dead and vanished,
And 'tis you, 'tis you must live!

 "Risen again, fire-tried, victorious,
From the grave of Crime down-hurled,
 Peerless, pure, serene and glorious,
Wield the sceptre of the world!"
