title: A Wooing Song.
---

My fair lady's a dear, dear lady - 
I walked by her side to woo.
In a garden alley, so sweet and shady,
She answered, "I love not you,
 John, John Brady,"
 Quoth my dear lady,
"Pray now, pray now, go your way now,
 Do, John, do!"

Yet my fair lady's my own, own lady,
For I passed another day;
While making her moan, she sat all alone,
And thus, and thus did she say:
 "John, John Brady,"
 Quoth my dear lady,
"Do now, do now, once more woo now.
 Pray, John, pray!"
