 Welladay!
 Here I lay
 You at rest - all worn away,
 O my pencil, to the tip
 Of our old companionship!

 Memory
 Sighs to see
 What you are, and used to be,
 Looking backward to the time
 When you wrote your earliest rhyme! -

 When I sat
 Filing at
 Your first point, and dreaming that
 Your initial song should be
 Worthy of posterity.

 With regret
 I forget
 If the song be living yet,
 Yet remember, vaguely now,
 It was honest, anyhow.

 You have brought
 Me a thought -
 Truer yet was never taught, -
 That the silent song is best,
 And the unsung worthiest.

 So if I,
 When I die,
 May as uncomplainingly
 Drop aside as now you do,
 Write of me, as I of you: -

 Here lies one
 Who begun
 Life a-singing, heard of none;
 And he died, satisfied,
 With his dead songs by his side.
