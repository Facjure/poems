title: Sonnet XXXVII. Autumn.
---

 Thro' changing Months a well-attemper'd Mind
Welcomes their gentle or terrific pace. - 
When o'er retreating Autumn's golden grace
Tempestuous Winter spreads in every wind
 Naked asperity, our musings find
Grandeur increasing, as the Glooms efface
Variety and glow. - Each solemn trace
Exalts the thoughts, from sensual joys refin'd.
 Then blended in our rapt ideas rise
The vanish'd charms, that summer-suns reveal,
With all of desolation, that now lies
 Dreary before us; - teach the Soul to feel
Awe in the Present, pleasure in the Past,
And to see vernal Morns in Hope's perspective cast.

 October 27th, 1782.
