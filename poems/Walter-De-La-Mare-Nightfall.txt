 The last light fails - that shallow pool of day!
 The coursers of the dark stamp down to drink,
 Arch their wild necks, lift their wild heads and neigh;
 Their drivers, gathering at the water-brink,
 With eyes ashine from out their clustering hair,
 Utter their hollow speech, or gaze afar,
 Rapt in irradiant reverie, to where
 Languishes, lost in light, the evening star.

 Come the wood-nymphs to dance within the glooms,
 Calling these charioteers with timbrels' din;
 Ashen with twilight the dark forest looms
 O'er the nocturnal beasts that prowl within
 "O glory of beauty which the world makes fair!"
 Pant they their serenading on the air.

 Sound the loud hooves, and all abroad the sky
 The lusty charioteers their stations take;
 Planet to planet do the sweet Loves fly,
 And in the zenith silver music wake.
 Cities of men, in blindness hidden low,
 Fume their faint flames to that arched firmament,
 But all the dwellers in the lonely know
 The unearthly are abroad, and weary and spent,
 With rush extinguished, to their dreaming go.
 And world and night and star-enclustered space
 The glory of beauty are in one enravished face.
