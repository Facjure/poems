 "Sharp words we had before the fight;
 But - now the fight is done - 
 Look, here's my hand," said the Victor bold,
 "Take it - an honest one!
 What, holding back? I mean you well;
 Though worsted, you strove stoutly, man;
 The odds were great; I honor you;
 Man honors man.

 "Still silent, friend? can grudges be?
 Yet am I held a foe? - 
 Turned to the wall, on his cot he lies - 
 Never I'll leave him so!
 Brave one! I here implore your hand;
 Dumb still? all fellowship fled?
 Nay, then, I'll have this stubborn hand"
 He snatched it - it was dead.
