title: My Henry
---

 He's jes' a great, big, awk'ard, hulkin'
 Feller, - humped, and sort o' sulkin' -
 Like, and ruther still-appearin' -
 Kind-as-ef he wuzn't keerin'
Whether school helt out er not -
That's my Henry, to a dot!

 Allus kind o' liked him - whether
 Childern, er growed-up together!
 Fifteen year' ago and better,
 'Fore he ever knowed a letter,
Run acrosst the little fool
In my Primer-class at school.

 When the Teacher wuzn't lookin',
 He'd be th'owin' wads; er crookin'
 Pins; er sprinklin' pepper, more'n
 Likely, on the stove; er borin'
Gimlet-holes up thue his desk -
Nothin' that boy wouldn't resk!

 But, somehow, as I was goin'
 On to say, he seemed so knowin',
 Other ways, and cute and cunnin' -
 Allus wuz a notion runnin'
Thue my giddy, fool-head he
Jes' had be'n cut out fer me!

 Don't go much on prophesyin',
 But last night whilse I wuz fryin'
 Supper, with that man a-pitchin'
 Little Marthy round the kitchen,
Think-says-I, "Them baby's eyes
Is my Henry's, jes' p'cise!"
