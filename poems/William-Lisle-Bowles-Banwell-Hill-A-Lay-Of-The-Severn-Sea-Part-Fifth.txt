PART FIFTH.

LANG SYNE - VISION OF THE DELUGE - CONCLUSION

 The music of "Lang Syne!" Oh! long ago
 It died away - died, and was heard no more!
 And where those hills that skirt the level vale,
 On to the left, the prospect intercept,
 I would not, could not look, were they removed;
 I would not, could not look, lest I should see
 The sunshine on that spot of all the world,
 Where, starting from the dream of youth, I gazed
 Long since, on the cold, clouded world, and cried,
 Beautiful vision, loved, adored, in vain,10
 Farewell - farewell, for ever!
 How sincere,
 How pure was my heart's love! oh! was it not?
 Yes; Heaven can witness, now my brow is changed,
 And I look back, and almost seem to hear
 The music of the days when we were young,
 Like music in a dream, ere we awoke,
 Oh! witness, Heaven, how fervent, how sincere - 
 How fervent, and how tender, and how pure, 19
 Was my fond heart's first love!
 The summer eve
 Shone, as with sympathy of sweet farewell,
 Upon thy Tor, and solitary mound,
 Glaston, as rapidly I passed along,
 Borne from those scenes for ever, while with song
 The sorrows of the hour and way beguiled.
So passed the days of youth, which ne'er return,
 Tearful; for worldly fortune smiled too late,
 And the poor minstrel-boy had then no wealth,
 Save such as poets dream of - love and hope.30
 At Fortune's frown, the wreath which Hope entwined
 Lay withering, for the dream had been too sweet
 For human life; yet never, though his love,
 All his fond love, he muttered to the winds;
 Though oft he strove, distempered, without joy,
 To drown even the remembrance that he lived - 
 Never a weak complaint escaped his lip,
 Save that some tender tones, as he passed on,
 Died on his desultory lyre.
 No more!40
 Forget the shadows of a feverish dream,
 That long has passed away! Uplift the eyes
 To Him who sits above the water flood, - 
 To Him who was, and is, and is to come!
 Wrapped in the view of ages that are passed,
 And marking here the record of earth's doom,
 Let us, even now, think that we hear the sound - 
 The sound of the great flood, the peopled earth
 Covering and surging in its solitude!
 Let us forget the passing hour, the stir 50
 Of this tumultuous scene of human things,
 And bid imagination lift the veil52
 Spread o'er the rolling globe four thousand years!
The vision of the deluge! Hark - a trump!
 It was the trump of the Archangel! Stern
 He stands, whilst the awakening thunder rolls
 Beneath his feet! Stern, and alone, he stands
 Upon Imaus' height!
 No voice is heard
 Of revelry or blasphemy so high! 60
 He sounds again his trumpet; and the clouds
 Come deepening o'er the world!
 Why art thou pale?
 A strange and fearful stillness is on earth,
 As if the shadow of the Almighty passed
 O'er the abodes of man, and hushed at once
 The song, the shout, the cries of violence,
 The groan of the oppressed, and the deep curse
 Of blasphemy, that scowls upon the clouds,
 And mocks the deeper thunder! 70
Hark! a voice - 
 Perish! Again the thunder rolls; the earth
 Answers, from north to south, from east to west - 
 Perish! The fountains of the mighty deep
 Are broken up; the rushing rains descend,
 Like night - deep night; while, momentary seen,
 Through blacker clouds, on his pale phantom-horse,
 Death, a gigantic skeleton, rides on,
 Rejoicing, where the millions of mankind - 
 Visible, where his lightning-arrows glared - 80
 Welter beneath the shadow of his horse!
 Now, dismally, through all her caverns, Hell
 Sends forth a horrid laugh, that dies away,
 And then a loud voice answers - Victory!
 Victory to the rider and his horse!85
 Victory to the rider and his horse!
Ride on: - the ark, majestic and alone
 On the wide waste of the careering deep,
 Its hull scarce peering through the night of clouds,
 Is seen. But, lo! the mighty deep has shrunk! 90
 The ark, from its terrific voyage, rests
 On Ararat. The raven is sent forth, - 
 Send out the dove, and as her wings far off
 Shine in the light, that streaks the severing clouds,
 Bid her speed on, and greet her with a song: - 

Go, beautiful and gentle dove;
 But whither wilt thou go?
For though the clouds ride high above,
 How sad and waste is all below!

The wife of Shem, a moment to her breast100
 Held the poor bird, and kissed it. Many a night
 When she was listening to the hollow wind,
 She pressed it to her bosom, with a tear;
 Or when it murmured in her hand, forgot
 The long, loud tumult of the storm without.
 She kisses it, and at her father's word,
 Bids it go forth.

The dove flies on! In lonely flight
 She flies from dawn till dark;
And now, amid the gloom of night,110
 Comes weary to the ark.
Oh! let me in, she seems to say,
For long and lone hath been my way!
Oh! once more, gentle mistress, let me rest,
And dry my dripping plumage on thy breast!

 So the bird flew to her who cherished it. 116
 She sent it forth again out of the ark; - 
 Again it came at evening fall, and, lo!
 An olive-leaf plucked off, and in its bill.
 And Shem's wife took the green leaf from its bill,120
 And kissed its wings again, and smilingly
 Dropped on its neck one silent tear for joy.
 She sent it forth once more; and watched its flight,
 Till it was lost amid the clouds of heaven:
 Then gazing on the clouds where it was lost,
 Its mournful mistress sung this last farewell: - 

Go, beautiful and gentle dove,
 And greet the morning ray;
For, lo! the sun shines bright above,
 And night and storm have passed away.130
No longer, drooping, here confined,
 In this cold prison dwell;
Go, free to sunshine and to wind,
 Sweet bird, go forth, and fare thee well!

Oh! beautiful and gentle dove,
 Thy welcome sad will be,
When thou shalt hear no voice of love,
 In murmurs from the leafy tree:
Yet freedom, freedom shalt thou find,
 From this cold prison's cell;140
Go, then, to sunshine and the wind,
 Sweet bird, go forth, and fare thee well![86]

 And never more she saw it; for the earth
 Was dry, and now, upon the mountain's van,
 Again the great Archangel stands; the light
 Of the moist rainbow glitters on his hair - 146
 He to the bow uplifts his hands, whose arch
 Spans the whole heaven; and whilst, far off, in light,
 The ascending dove is for a moment seen,
 The last rain falls - falls, gently and unheard. 150
 Amid the silent sunshine! Oh! look up! - 
 Above the clouds, borne up the depth of light,
 Behold a cross! - and round about the cross,
 Lo! angels and archangels jubilant,
 Till the ascending pomp in light is lost,
 Lift their acclaiming voice - Glory to thee,
 Glory, and praise, and honour be to thee,
 Lord God of hosts; we laud and magnify
 Thy glorious name, praising Thee evermore,
 For the great dragon is cast down, and hell160
 Vanquished beneath thy cross, Lord Jesus Christ!
Hark! the clock strikes! The shadowy scene dissolves,
 And all the visionary pomp is past!
 I only see a few sheep on the edge
 Of this aï¿½rial ridge, and Banwell Tower,
 Gray in the morning sunshine, at our feet.
Farewell to Banwell Cave, and Banwell Hill,
 And Banwell Church;[87] and farewell to the shores
 Where, when a child, I wandered; and farewell,
 Harp of my youth! Above this mountain-cave170
 I leave thee, murmuring to the fitful breeze
 That wanders from that sea, whose sound I heard
 So many years ago.
 Yet, whilst the light
 Steals from the clouds, to rest upon that tower,
 I turn a parting look, and lift to Heaven
 A parting prayer, that our own Zion, thus, - 
 With sober splendour, yet not gorgeous, 178
 Her mitred brow tempered with lenity
 And apostolic mildness - in her mien
 No dark defeature, beautiful as mild,
 And gentle as the smile of charity, - 
 Thus on the Rock of Ages may uplift
 Her brow majestic, pointing to the spires
 That grace her village glens, or solemn fanes
 In cities, calm above the stir and smoke,
 And listening to deep harmonies that swell
 From all her temples!
So may she adorn - 
 Her robe as graceful, as her creed is pure -190
 This happy land, till time shall be no more!
And whilst her gray cathedrals rise in air,
 Solemn, august, and beautiful, and touched
 By time, to show a grace, but no decay,
 Like that fair pile, which, from hoar Mendip's brow,
 The traveller beholds, crowning the vale
 Of Avalon, with all its towers in light;
 So, England, may thy gray cathedrals lift
 Their front in heaven's pure light, and ever boast
 Such prelate-lords - bland, but yet dignified -200
 Pious, paternal, and beloved, as he
 Who prompted, and forgives, this Severn song!
And thou, O Lord and Saviour! on whose rock
 That Church is founded, though the storm without
 May howl around its battlements, preserve
 Its spirit, and still pour into the hearts
 Of all, who there confess thy holy name,
 Peace, that, through evil or through good report,
 They may hold on their blameless way!
 For me, 210
 Though disappointment, like a morning cloud,
 Hung on my early hopes, that cloud is passed, - 
 Is passed, but not forgotten, - and the light
 Is calm, not cold, which rests upon the scene,
 Soon to be ended. I may wake no more
 The melody of song on earth; but Thee,
 Father of Heaven, and Saviour, at this hour,
 Father and Lord, I thank Thee that no song
 Of mine, from youth to age, has left a stain
 I would blot out; and grateful for the good
 Thy providence, through many years, has lent,
 Humbly I wait the close, till Thy high will
 Dismiss me, - blessed if, when that hour shall come,
 My life may plead, far better than my song.

He had no home in the world; but he found an asylum with the generous nobleman who had been his old schoolfellow at Winchester. Here, it is said, he brought with him his shroud, in which he was buried at Frome; and here he chiefly composed his four volumes of poems.]
