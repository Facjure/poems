title: Patriot Fighting For His Home.

On the shores of the northern lakes
An infant giant now awakes,
He has long time been in a dream,
But now is roused by engine's scream.

For mighty spirits are abroad
Traversing of each great railroad,
For it is a glorious theme
The peaceful conquest made by steam.

But should the foot of invader vile
Ever desecrate his soil,
He firm will meet him bold and brave
And give him soil Canadian grave.
