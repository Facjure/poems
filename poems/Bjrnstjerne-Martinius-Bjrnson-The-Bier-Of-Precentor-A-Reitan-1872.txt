(See Note 56)

With smiles his soft eyes ever gleamed,
 When God and country thinking;
With endless joy, his soul, it seemed,
 Faith, fatherland, was linking.
His word, his song,
Like springs flowed strong;
They fruitful made the valley long,
 And quickened all there drinking.

Poor people and poor homes among
 In wintry region saddest,
In Sunday's choir he always sung,
 Of all the world the gladdest:
"The axis stout
It turns about,
Falls not the poorest home without,
 For thus, O God, Thou badest."

With sickness came a heavy year
 And put to proof his singing,
While helpless children standing near
 His trust to test were bringing.
But glad the more,
As soft notes soar
When winds o'er hidden harp-strings pour,
His song his soul was winging.

His life foretold us that erelong
 With faith in God unshaken
Shall all our nation stand in song,
 And church, home, school, awaken,
In Norway's song,
In gladness' song,
In glory of the Lord's own song,
From life's low squalor taken.

Fair fatherland, do not forget,
 The children of his bower!
He, poor as is the rosebush, yet
 Gave gladness till death's hour - 
With failure's smart
Let not depart
From this thy soil so glad a heart, - 
His garden, let it flower!
