 (In a Style Skeltonical)

 Listen now this time
 Shortly to my rhyme
 That herewith starts
 About certain kind hearts
 In those stricken parts
 That lie behind Calais,
 Old crones and aged men
 And young children.
 About the Picardais,
 Who earned my thousand thanks,
 Dwellers by the banks
 Of mournful Somme
 (God keep me therefrom
 Until War ends), 
 These, then, are my friends:
 Madame Averlant Lune,
 From the town of Bethune;
 Good Professeur la Brune
 From that town also.
 He played the piccolo,
 And left his locks to grow.
 Dear Madame Hojdes,
 Sempstress of Saint Fe.
 With Jules and Susette
 And Antoinette.
 Her children, my sweethearts,
 For whom I made darts
 Of paper to throw
 In their mimic show,
 "La guerre aux tranchees."
 That was a pretty play.

 There was old Jacques Caron,
 Of the hamlet Mailleton.
 He let me look
 At his household book,
 "Comment vivre cent ans."
 What cares I took
 To obey this wise book,
 I, who feared each hour
 Lest Death's cruel power
 On the poppied plain
 Might make cares vain!

 By Noeus-les-mines
 Lived old Adelphine,
 Withered and clean,
 She nodded and smiled,
 And used me like a child.
 How that old trot beguiled
 My leisure with her chatter,
 Gave me a china platter
 Painted with Cherubim
 And mottoes on the rim.
 But when instead of thanks
 I gave her francs
 How her pride was hurt!
 She counted francs as dirt,
 (God knows, she was not rich)
 She called the Kaiser bitch,
 She spat on the floor,
 Cursing this Prussian war,
 That she had known before
 Forty years past and more.

 There was also "Tomi,"
 With looks sweet and free,
 Who called me cher ami.
 This orphan's age was nine,
 His folk were in their graves,
 Else they were slaves
 Behind the German line
 To terror and rapine, 
 O, little friends of mine
 How kind and brave you were,
 You smoothed away care
 When life was hard to bear.
 And you, old women and men,
 Who gave me billets then,
 How patient and great-hearted!
 Strangers though we started,
 Yet friends we ever parted.
 God bless you all:now ends
 This homage to my friends.
