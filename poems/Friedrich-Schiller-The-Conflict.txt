title: The Conflict.

 No! I this conflict longer will not wage,
 The conflict duty claims the giant task; 
 Thy spells, O virtue, never can assuage
 The heart's wild fire this offering do not ask

 True, I have sworn a solemn vow have sworn,
 That I myself will curb the self within;
 Yet take thy wreath, no more it shall be worn 
 Take back thy wreath, and leave me free to sin.

 Rent be the contract I with thee once made; 
 She loves me, loves me forfeit be the crown!
 Blessed he who, lulled in rapture's dreamy shade,
 Glides, as I glide, the deep fall gladly down.

 She sees the worm that my youth's bloom decays,
 She sees my spring-time wasted as it flees;
 And, marvelling at the rigor that gainsays
 The heart's sweet impulse, my reward decrees.

 Distrust this angel purity, fair soul!
 It is to guilt thy pity armeth me;
 Could being lavish its unmeasured whole,
 It ne'er could give a gift to rival thee!

 Thee the dear guilt I ever seek to shun,
 O tyranny of fate, O wild desires!
 My virtue's only crown can but be won
 In that last breath when virtue's self expires!
