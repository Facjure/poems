The time admits not flowers or leaves
 To deck the banquet. Fiercely flies
 The blast of North and East, and ice
Makes daggers at the sharpen'd eaves,

And bristles all the brakes and thorns
 To yon hard crescent, as she hangs
 Above the wood which grides and clangs
Its leafless ribs and iron horns

Together, in the drifts that pass,
 To darken on the rolling brine
 That breaks the coast. But fetch the wine,
Arrange the board and brim the glass;

Bring in great logs and let them lie,
 To make a solid core of heat;
 Be cheerful-minded, talk and treat
Of all things ev'n as he were by:

We keep the day with festal cheer,
 With books and music. Surely we
 Will drink to him whate'er he be,
And sing the songs he loved to hear.




In Memoriam.



Non hora myrto, non violis sinit
Nitere mensas. Trux Aquilo foras
 Bacchatur, ac passim pruina
 Tigna sagittifera coruscant;

Horretque saltus spinifer, algidae
Sub falce lunae, dum nemori imminet,
 Quod stridet illiditque costis
 Cornua, jam vacuis honorum,

Ferrata; nimbis praetereuntibus,
Ut incubent tandem implacido sali
 Qui curvat oras. Tu Falernum
 Prome, dapes strue, dic coronent

Crateras: ignis cor solidum, graves
Repone truncos. Jamque doloribus
 Loquare securus fugatis
 Quae socio loquereris illo;

Hunc dedicamus laetitiae diem
Lyraeque musisque. Illius, illius
 Da, quicquid audit: nec silebunt
 Qui numeri placuere vivo.
