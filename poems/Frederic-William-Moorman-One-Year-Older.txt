One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:
 That's what I sal awlus say.
Draw thy chair a little nearer,
 Put yon stockin's reight away.
Thou hast done enough i' thy time,
 Tewed i' t' house an' wrowt at loom;
Just for once thou mun sit idle,
 Feet on t' hear'stone, fingers toom.(1)

One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:
 So I promised when we wed.
Then thy een were glest'rin' clearer
 Nor the stars aboon us spread.
If they're dimmer now, they're tend'rer,
 An' yon wrinkles on thy face
Tell a lesson true as t' Bible,
 Speik o' charity an' grace.

One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:
 We've supped sorrow, tasted joy,
But our love has grown sincerer,
 Gethered strength nowt can destroy.
Love is like an oak i' t' forest,
 Ivery yeer it adds a ring;
Love is like yon ivin tendrils,
 Ivery day they closer cling.

One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:
 Time's the shuttle, life's the yarn.
Have thy crosses seemed severer
 'Cause thou niver had a barn?
Mebbe I sud not have loved thee
 Hauf so weel, if I mud share
All our secret thowts wi' childer,
 Twinin' round my owd arm-chair.

One yeer owder, one yeer dearer:
 'Tis our gowden weddin' day.
There sal coom no gaumless fleerer
 To break in upon our play.
Look, I've stecked(2) wer door and window
 Let me lap thee i' my arms;
Hushed to-neet be ivery murmur,
 While my kiss thy pale face warms.
