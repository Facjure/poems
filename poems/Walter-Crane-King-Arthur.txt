1.
When good King Arthur ruled this land,
He was a goodly king--
He stole three pecks of barley-meal,
To make a bag pudding.

2.
A bag pudding the Queen did make,
And stuffed it well with plums,
And in it put great lumps of fat
As big as my two thumbs.

3.
The King and Queen did eat thereof,
And noblemen beside,
And what they could not eat that night
The Queen next morning fried.
