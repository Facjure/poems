 Lo! steadfast and serene,
 In patient pause between
 The seen and the unseen,
What gentle zephyrs fan
 Your silken silver hair, -
 And what diviner air
 Breathes round you like a prayer,
Old Man?

 Can you, in nearer view
 Of Glory, pierce the blue
 Of happy Heaven through;
And, listening mutely, can
 Your senses, dull to us,
 Hear Angel-voices thus,
 In chorus glorious -
Old Man?

 In your reposeful gaze
 The dusk of Autumn days
 Is blent with April haze,
As when of old began
 The bursting of the bud
 Of rosy babyhood -
 When all the world was good,
Old Man.

 And yet I find a sly
 Little twinkle in your eye;
 And your whisperingly shy
Little laugh is simply an
 Internal shout of glee
 That betrays the fallacy
 You'd perpetrate on me,
Old Man.

 So just put up the frown
 That your brows are pulling down!
 Why, the fleetest boy in town,
As he bared his feet and ran,
 Could read with half a glance -
 And of keen rebuke, perchance -
 Your secret countenance,
Old Man.

 Now, honestly, confess:
 Is an old man any less
 Than the little child we bless
And caress when we can?
 Isn't age but just a place
 Where you mask the childish face
 To preserve its inner grace,
Old Man?

 Hasn't age a truant day,
 Just as that you went astray
 In the wayward, restless way,
When, brown with dust and tan,
 Your roguish face essayed,
 In solemn masquerade,
 To hide the smile it made,
Old Man?

 Now, fair, and square, and true,
 Don't your old soul tremble through,
 As in youth it used to do
When it brimmed and overran
 With the strange, enchanted sights,
 And the splendors and delights
 Of the old "Arabian Nights,"
Old Man?

 When, haply, you have fared
 Where glad Aladdin shared
 His lamp with you, and dared
The Afrite and his clan;
 And, with him, clambered through
 The trees where jewels grew -
 And filled your pockets, too,
Old Man?

 Or, with Sinbad, at sea -
 And in veracity
 Who has sinned as bad as he,
Or would, or will, or can? -
 Have you listened to his lies,
 With open mouth and eyes,
 And learned his art likewise,
Old Man?

 And you need not deny
 That your eyes were wet as dry,
 Reading novels on the sly!
And review them, if you can
 And the same warm tears will fall -
 Only faster, that is all -
 Over Little Nell and Paul,
Old Man!

 Oh, you were a lucky lad -
 Just as good as you were bad!
 And the host of friends you had -
Charley, Tom, and Dick, and Dan;
 And the old School-Teacher, too,
 Though he often censured you;
 And the girls in pink and blue,
Old Man.

 And - as often you have leant,
 In boyish sentiment,
 To kiss the letter sent
By Nelly, Belle, or Nan -
 Wherein the rose's hue
 Was red, the violet blue -
 And sugar sweet - and you,
Old Man, -

 So, to-day, as lives the bloom,
 And the sweetness, and perfume
 Of the blossoms, I assume,
On the same mysterious plan
 The Master's love assures,
 That the selfsame boy endures
 In that hale old heart of yours,
Old Man.
