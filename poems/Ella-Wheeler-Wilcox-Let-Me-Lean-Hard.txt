title: Let Me Lean Hard.
---

 Let me lean hard upon the Eternal Breast:
 In all earth's devious ways I sought for rest
 And found it not. I will be strong, said I,
 And lean upon myself. I will not cry
 And importune all heaven with my complaint.
 But now my strength fails, and I fall, I faint:
 Let me lean hard.

 Let me lean hard upon the unfailing Arm.
 I said I will walk on, I fear no harm,
 The spark divine within my soul will show
 The upward pathway where my feet should go.
 But now the heights to which I most aspire
 Are lost in clouds. I stumble and I tire:
 Let me lean hard.

 Let me lean harder yet. That swerveless force
 Which speeds the solar systems on their course
 Can take, unfelt, the burden of my woe,
 Which bears me to the dust and hurts me so.
 I thought my strength enough for any fate,
 But lo! I sink beneath my sorrow's weight:
 Let me lean hard.
