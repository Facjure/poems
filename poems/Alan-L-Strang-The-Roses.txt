I have roses in my garden,
And their fragrance fills the air.
How I love to watch them blooming;
For they all are very fair.

Some have deep red velvet petals,
Some again are snowy white;
And the little baby pink ones,
Surely give you such delight.

Pretty birds come to my garden,
And sing there the live-long day;
Yes the birds and pretty flowers
Help and cheer us on our way.
