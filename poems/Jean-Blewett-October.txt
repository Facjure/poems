Who is it says May is the crown of the year?
 Who is it says June is the gladdest?
Who is it says Autumn is withered and sere,
 The gloomiest season and saddest?

You shut to your doors as I come with my train,
 And heed not the challenge I'm flinging,
The ruddy leaf washed by the fresh falling rain,
 The scarlet vine creeping and clinging!

Come out where I'm holding my court like a queen,
 With canopy rare stretching over;
Come out where I revel in amber and green,
 And soon I may call you my lover!

Come out to the hillside, come out to the vale,
 Come out ere your mood turns to blaming,
Come out where my gold is, my red gold and pale,
 Come out where my banners are flaming!

Come out where the bare furrows stretch in the glow,
 Come out where the stubble fields glisten,
Where the wind it blows high, and the wind it blows low,
 And the lean grasses dance as they listen!
