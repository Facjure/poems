title: A Song Of Poppies
---

I love red poppies! Imperial red poppies!
 Sun-worshippers are they;
Gladly as trees live through a hundred summers
 They live one little day.

I love red poppies! Impassioned scarlet poppies!
 Ever their strange perfume
Seems like an essence brewed by fairy people
 From an immortal bloom.

I love red poppies! Red, silken, swaying poppies!
 Deep in their hearts they keep
A magic cure for woe - a draught of Lethe - 
 A lotus-gift of sleep.

I love red poppies! Soft silver-stemmed, red poppies,
 That from the rain and sun
Gather a balm to heal some earth-born sorrow,
 When their glad day is done.
