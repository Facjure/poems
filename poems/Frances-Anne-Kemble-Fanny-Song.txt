 Pass thy hand through my hair, lore;
One little year ago,
 In a curtain bright and rare, love,
It fell golden o'er my brow.
 But the gold has passed away, love,
And the drooping curls are thin,
 And cold threads of wintry gray, love,
Glitter their folds within:
How should this be, in one short year?
It is not age - can it be care?

 Fasten thine eyes on mine, love;
One little year ago,
 Midsummer's sunny shine, love,
Had not a warmer glow.
 But the light is there no more, love,
Save in melancholy gleams,
 Like wan moonlight wand'ring o'er, love,
Dim lands in troubled dreams:
How should this be, in one short year?
It is not age - can it be care?

 Lay thy cheek to my cheek, love,
One little year ago
 It was ripe, and round, and sleek, love,
As the autumn peaches grow.
 But the rosy hue has fled, love,
Save a flush that goes and comes,
 Like a flow'r born from the dead, love,
And blooming over tombs:
How should this be, in one short year?
It is not age - can it be care?
