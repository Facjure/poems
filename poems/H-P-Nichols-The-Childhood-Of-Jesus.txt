title: The Childhood Of Jesus.

Of the childhood of our Saviour
Tells one simple verse alone;
Yet from that his whole behavior
When he was a child, is known.

He was subject to his mother,
So the holy Scriptures say;
'Tis enough, we need no other
Record of him day by day.

Thus we, his obedience knowing,
Know how gentle and how mild,--
How in truth and goodness growing
Was our Saviour from a child.

Little children, who endeavor
Like the blessed One to be,
As you try, remember ever
How obedient was he.

If, like Jesus pure and holy,
You your parents' will obey,
You will grow more meek and lowly,
And more like him, every day.
