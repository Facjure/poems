title: Song. - To The Tune Of "Ye Gentlemen Of England." Written During A Period When It Was Confidently Believed That The French Would Invade Our Country.
---

No gentleman of England now sits at home at ease,
But emulates on shore the heroes of the seas;
A common cause unites them, to meet the daring foe,
All they wish, all they ask, is a fav'ring wind to blow.

Oh! let them come along, and may no tempests low'r,
But fairly may we try our valour and our pow'r,
That Hist'ry may not say, should these robbers be laid low,
To the storm 'tis alone the victory we owe.

Soon shall these infidels the dreadful diff'rence prove,
'Twixt slaves impell'd by fear, and freemen bound by love;
Our foes shall never rise again, when once they are laid low,
On the sea, on the shore, for justice strikes the blow.
