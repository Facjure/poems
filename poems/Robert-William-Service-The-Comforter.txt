 As I sat by my baby's bed
 That's open to the sky,
 There fluttered round and round my head
 A radiant butterfly.

 And as I wept - of hearts that ache
 The saddest in the land - 
 It left a lily for my sake,
 And lighted on my hand.

 I watched it, oh, so quietly,
 And though it rose and flew,
 As if it fain would comfort me
 It came and came anew.

 Now, where my darling lies at rest,
 I do not dare to sigh,
 For look! there gleams upon my breast
 A snow-white butterfly.
