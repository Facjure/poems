Father Felipe

I speak not the English well, but Pachita,
She speak for me; is it not so, my Pancha?
Eh, little rogue? Come, salute me the stranger
Americano.

Sir, in my country we say, �Where the heart is,
There live the speech.� Ah! you not understand? So!
Pardon an old man, what you call �old fogy,�
Padre Felipe!

Old, Se�or, old! just so old as the Mission.
You see that pear-tree? How old you think, Se�or?
Fifteen year? Twenty? Ah, Senor, just fifty
Gone since I plant him!

You like the wine? It is some at the Mission,
Made from the grape of the year eighteen hundred;
All the same time when the earthquake he come to
San Juan Bautista.

But Pancha is twelve, and she is the rose-tree;
And I am the olive, and this is the garden:
And �Pancha� we say, but her name is �Francisca,�
Same like her mother.

Eh, you knew her? No? Ah! it is a story;
But I speak not, like Pachita, the English:
So! if I try, you will sit here beside me,
And shall not laugh, eh?

When the American come to the Mission,
Many arrive at the house of Francisca:
One, he was fine man, he buy the cattle
Of Jose Castro.

So! he came much, and Francisca, she saw him:
And it was love, and a very dry season;
And the pears bake on the tree, and the rain come,
But not Francisca.

Not for one year; and one night I have walk much
Under the olive-tree, when comes Francisca,
Comes to me here, with her child, this Francisca,
Under the olive-tree.

Sir, it was sad; . . . but I speak not the English;
So! . . . she stay here, and she wait for her husband:
He come no more, and she sleep on the hillside;
There stands Pachita.

Ah! there�s the Angelus. Will you not enter?
Or shall you walk in the garden with Pancha?
Go, little rogue st! attend to the stranger!
Adios, Se�or.

Pachita (briskly).

So, he�s been telling that yarn about mother!
Bless you! he tells it to every stranger:
Folks about yer say the old man�s my father;
What�s your opinion?
