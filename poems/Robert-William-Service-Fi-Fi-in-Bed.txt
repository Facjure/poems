 Up into the sky I stare;
 All the little stars I see;
 And I know that God is there
 O, how lonely He must be!

 Me, I laugh and leap all day,
 Till my head begins to nod;
 He's so great, He cannot play:
 I am glad I am not God.

 Poor kind God upon His throne,
 Up there in the sky so blue,
 Always, always all alone . . .
 "Please, dear God, I pity You."
