 It was beneath a waning moon when all the woods were sear,
 And winds made eddies of the leaves that whispered far and near,
 I met her on the old mill-bridge we parted at last year.

 At first I deemed it but a mist that faltered in that place,
 An autumn mist beneath the trees that sentineled the race;
 Until I neared and in the moon beheld her face to face.

 The waver of the summer-heat upon the drouth-dry leas;
 The shimmer of the thistle-drift a down the silences;
 The gliding of the fairy-fire between the swamp and trees;

 They qualified her presence as a sorrow may a dream
 The vague suggestion of a self; the glimmer of a gleam;
 The actual unreal of the things that only seem.

 Where once she came with welcome and glad eyes all loving-wise,
 She passed and gave no greeting that my heart might recognize,
 With far-set face unseeing and sad unremembering eyes.

 It was beneath a waning moon when woods were bleak and sear,
 And winds made whispers of the leaves that eddied far and near,
 I met her ghost upon the bridge we parted at last year.
