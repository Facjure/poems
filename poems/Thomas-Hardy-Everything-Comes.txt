"The house is bleak and cold
 Built so new for me!
All the winds upon the wold
 Search it through for me;
No screening trees abound,
And the curious eyes around
 Keep on view for me."

"My Love, I am planting trees
 As a screen for you
Both from winds, and eyes that tease
 And peer in for you.
Only wait till they have grown,
No such bower will be known
 As I mean for you."

"Then I will bear it, Love,
 And will wait," she said.
- So, with years, there grew a grove.
 "Skill how great!" she said.
"As you wished, Dear?" - "Yes, I see!
But - I'm dying; and for me
 'Tis too late," she said.
