All the aim of life is just
 Getting back to God.
Spirit casting off its dust,
 Getting back to God.
Every grief we have to bear
Disappointment, cross, despair
Each is but another stair
 Climbing back to God.

Step by step and mile by mile - 
 Getting back to God;
Nothing else is worth the while - 
 Getting back to God.
Light and shadow fill each day
Joys and sorrows pass away,
Smile at all, and smiling, say,
 Getting back to God.

Do not wear a mournful face
 Getting back to God;
Scatter sunshine on the place
 Going back to God;
Take what pleasure you can find,
But where'er your paths may wind.
Keep the purpose well in mind, - 
 Getting back to God.
