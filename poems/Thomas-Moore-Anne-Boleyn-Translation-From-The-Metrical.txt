"Histoire d'Anne Boleyn."


"S'elle estoit belle et de taille �l�gante,
Estoit des yeulx encor plus attirante,
Lesquelz s�avoit bien conduyre � propos
En les lenant quelquefoys en repos;
Aucune foys envoyant en message
Porter du cueur le secret tesmoignage."


Much as her form seduced the sight,
Her eyes could even more surely woo;
And when and how to shoot their light
Into men's hearts full well she knew.
For sometimes in repose she hid
Their rays beneath a downcast lid;
And then again, with wakening air,
Would send their sunny glances out,
Like heralds of delight, to bear
Her heart's sweet messages about.
