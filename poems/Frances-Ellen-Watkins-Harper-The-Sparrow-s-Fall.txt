title: The Sparrow's Fall.
---

 Too frail to soar - a feeble thing -
 It fell to earth with fluttering wing;
 But God, who watches over all,
 Beheld that little sparrow's fall.

 'Twas not a bird with plumage gay,
 Filling the air with its morning lay;
 'Twas not an eagle bold and strong,
 Borne on the tempest's wing along.


 Only a brown and weesome thing,
 With drooping head and listless wing;
 It could not drift beyond His sight
 Who marshals the splendid stars of night.

 Its dying chirp fell on His ears,
 Who tunes the music of the spheres,
 Who hears the hungry lion's call,
 And spreads a table for us all.

 Its mission of song at last is done,
 No more will it greet the rising sun;
 That tiny bird has found a rest
 More calm than its mother's downy breast

 Oh, restless heart, learn thou to trust
 In God, so tender, strong and just;
 In whose love and mercy everywhere
 His humblest children have a share.

 If in love He numbers ev'ry hair,
 Whether the strands be dark or fair,
 Shall we not learn to calmly rest,
 Like children, on our Father's breast?
