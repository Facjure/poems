Omens are the cloth of dreams
scissors used to open sky -
the future riding birds
en route to ariel docking piles.

Leonardo was of the opinion creativity might be
enhanced a notch should aspiring artists nota bene

then perceive them piecemeal as stratagem, not snuff or
random blotch, the heads of diseased pigs
but conjuror-sextants toward the stars.
