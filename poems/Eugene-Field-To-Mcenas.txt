Than you, O valued friend of mine,
A better patron non est!
Come, quaff my home-made Sabine wine,--
You'll find it poor but honest.

I put it up that famous day
You patronized the ballet,
And the public cheered you such a way
As shook your native valley.

C�cuban and the Calean brand
May elsewhere claim attention;
But I have none of these on hand,--
For reasons I'll not mention.
