After The Manner Of Horace.



Friend, there be they on whom mishap
 Or never or so rarely comes,
That, when they think thereof, they snap
 Derisive thumbs:

And there be they who lightly lose
 Their all, yet feel no aching void;
Should aught annoy them, they refuse
 To be annoy'd:

And fain would I be e'en as these!
 Life is with such all beer and skittles;
They are not difficult to please
 About their victuals:

The trout, the grouse, the early pea,
 By such, if there, are freely taken;
If not, they munch with equal glee
 Their bit of bacon:

And when they wax a little gay
 And chaff the public after luncheon,
If they're confronted with a stray
 Policeman's truncheon,

They gaze thereat with outstretch'd necks,
 And laughter which no threats can smother,
And tell the horror-stricken X
 That he's another.

In snowtime if they cross a spot
 Where unsuspected boys have slid,
They fall not down - though they would not
 Mind if they did:

When the spring rosebud which they wear
 Breaks short and tumbles from its stem,
No thought of being angry e'er
 Dawns upon them;

Though 'twas Jemima's hand that placed,
 (As well you ween) at evening's hour,
In the loved button-hole that chaste
 And cherish'd flower.

And when they travel, if they find
 That they have left their pocket-compass
Or Murray or thick boots behind,
 They raise no rumpus,

But plod serenely on without:
 Knowing it's better to endure
The evil which beyond all doubt
 You cannot cure.

When for that early train they're late,
 They do not make their woes the text
Of sermons in the Times, but wait
 On for the next;

And jump inside, and only grin
 Should it appear that that dry wag,
The guard, omitted to put in
 Their carpet-bag.
