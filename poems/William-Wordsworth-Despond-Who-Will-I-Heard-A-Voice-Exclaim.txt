title: Despond Who Will, 'I' Heard A Voice Exclaim
---

 Despond who will, 'I' heard a voice exclaim,
 "Though fierce the assault, and shattered the defense,
 It cannot be that Britain's social frame,
 The glorious work of time and providence,
 Before a flying season's rash pretense,
 Should fall; that She, whose virtue put to shame,
 When Europe prostrate lay, the Conqueror's aim,
 Should perish, self-subverted. Black and dense
 The cloud is; but brings 'that' a day of doom.
 To Liberty? Her sun is up the while,
 That orb whose beams round Saxon Alfred shone:
 Then laugh, ye innocent Vales! ye Streams, sweep on,
 Nor let one billow of our heaven-blest Isle
 Toss in the fanning wind a humbler plume."
