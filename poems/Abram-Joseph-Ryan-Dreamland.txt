 Over the silent sea of sleep,
Far away! far away!
 Over a strange and starlit deep
Where the beautiful shadows sway;
Dim in the dark,
Glideth a bark,
Where never the waves of a tempest roll --
Bearing the very "soul of a soul",
Alone, all alone --
 Far away -- far away
To shores all unknown
 In the wakings of the day;
To the lovely land of dreams,
Where what is meets with what seems
Brightly dim, dimly bright;
Where the suns meet stars at night,
Where the darkness meets the light
Heart to heart, face to face,
In an infinite embrace.

 *****

Mornings break,
And we wake,
 And we wonder where we went
In the bark
Thro' the dark,
 But our wonder is misspent;
For no day can cast a light
On the dreamings of the night.
