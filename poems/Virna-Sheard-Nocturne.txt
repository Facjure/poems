Infold us with thy peace, dear moon-lit night,
 And let thy silver silence wrap us round
Till we forget the city's dazzling light,
 The city's ceaseless sound.

Here where the sand lies white upon the shore,
 And little velvet-fingered breezes blow,
Dear sea, thy world-old wonder-song once more
 Sing to us e'er we go.

Give us thy garnered sweets, short summer hour:
 Perfume of rose, and balm of sun-steeped pine;
Scent from the lily's cup and horned flower,
 Where bees have drained the wine.

Come, small musicians in the rough sea grass,
 Pipe us the serenade we love the best;
And winds of midnight, chant for us a mass,
 Our hearts would be at rest.

God of all beauty, though the world is thine,
 Our faith grows often faint, oft hope is spent;
Show us Thyself in all things fair and fine,
 Teach us the stars' content.
