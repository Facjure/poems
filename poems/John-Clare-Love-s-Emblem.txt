title: Love's Emblem
---

 Go rose, my Chloe's bosom grace:
 How happy should I prove,
 Could I supply that envied place
 With never-fading love.

 Accept, dear maid, now Summer glows,
 This pure, unsullied gem,
 Love's emblem in a full-blown rose,
 Just broken from the stem.

 Accept it as a favourite flower
 For thy soft breast to wear;
 'Twill blossom there its transient hour,
 A favourite of the fair.

 Upon thy cheek its blossom glows,
 As from a mirror clear,
 Making thyself a living rose,
 In blossom all the year.

 It is a sweet and favourite flower
 To grace a maiden's brow,
 Emblem of love without its power--
 A sweeter rose art thou.

 The rose, like hues of insect wing,
 May perish in an hour;
 'T is but at best a fading thing,
 But thou'rt a living flower.

 The roses steeped in morning dews
 Would every eye enthrall,
 But woman, she alone subdues;
 Her beauty conquers all.
