---

 Before the world had past her time of youth
 While polity and discipline were weak,
 The precept eye for eye, and tooth for tooth,
 Came forth a light, though but as of daybreak,
 Strong as could then be borne. A Master meek
 Proscribed the spirit fostered by that rule,
 Patience 'his' law, long-suffering 'his' school,
 And love the end, which all through peace must seek.
 But lamentably do they err who strain
 His mandates, given rash impulse to control
 And keep vindictive thirstings from the soul,
 So far that, if consistent in their scheme,
 They must forbid the State to inflict a pain,
 Making of social order a mere dream.
