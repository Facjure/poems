title: The Priest�s Brother
---

 Thrice in the night the priest arose
 From broken sleep to kneel and pray.
 �Hush, poor ghost, till the red cock crows,
 And I a Mass for your soul may say.�

 Thrice he went to the chamber cold,
 Where, stiff and still uncoffin�d,
 His brother lay, his beads he told,
 And �Rest, poor spirit, rest,� he said.

 Thrice lay the old priest down to sleep
 Before the morning bell should toll;
 But still he heard-and woke to weep-
 The crying of his brother�s soul.

 All through the dark, till dawn was pale,
 The priest tossed in his misery,
 With muffled ears to hide the wail,
 The voice of that ghost�s agony.

 At last the red cock flaps his wings
 To trumpet of a day new-born.
 The lark, awaking, soaring sings
 Into the bosom of the morn.

 The priest before the altar stands,
 He hears the spirit call for peace;
 He beats his breast with shaking hands.
 �O Father, grant this soul�s release.

 �Most Just and Merciful, set free
 From Purgatory�s awful night
 This sinner�s soul, to fly to Thee,
 And rest for ever in Thy sight.�

 The Mass is over-still the clerk
 Kneels pallid in the morning glow.
 He said, �From evils of the dark
 Oh, bless me, father, ere you go.

 �Benediction, that I may rest,
 For all night did the Banshee weep.�
 The priest raised up his hands and blest-
 �Go now, my child, and you will sleep.�

 The priest went down the vestry stair,
 He laid his vestments in their place,
 And turned-a pale ghost met him there,
 With beads of pain upon his face.

 �Brother,� he said, �you have gained me peace,
 But why so long did you know my tears,
 And say no Mass for my soul�s release,
 To save the torture of all those years?�

 �God rest you, brother,� the good priest said,
 �No years have passed-but a single night.�
 He showed the body uncoffin�d,
 And the six wax candles still alight.

 The living flowers on the dead man�s breast
 Blew out a perfume sweet and strong.
 The spirit paused ere he passed to rest-
 �God save your soul from a night so long.�
