Can you make me a cambric shirt,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Without any seam or needlework?
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

Can you wash it in yonder well,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Where never sprung water, nor rain ever fell?
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

Can you dry it on yonder thorn,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Which never bore blossom since Adam was born?
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

Now you have ask'd me questions three,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
I hope you'll answer as many for me,
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

Can you find me an acre of land,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Between the salt water and the sea sand?
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

Can you plough it with a ram's horn,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
And sow it all over with one pepper-corn?
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

Can you reap it with a sickle of leather,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
And bind it up with a peacock's feather?
And you shall be a true lover of mine.

When you have done and finish'd your work,
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;
Then come to me for your cambric shirt,
And you shall be a true lover of mine.
