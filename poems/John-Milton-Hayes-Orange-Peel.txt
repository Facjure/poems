The colonel stopped, and glared around,
Then, pointing sternly to the ground,
�What does this mean?� demanded he,
�A piece of orange peel I see!�

The Major called the Captain then,
And said, �By Gad! Your fault again!
Now what the blazes do you mean
By letting all this filth be seen?�

The Captain sniffed, but took the snub,
Then, calling to the junior Sub.,
Observed, �Look here, what�s all this mess?
It�s fit for pigs, sir, nothing less!�

The junior Sub. blushed crimson red,
Then, to the Sergeant-major, said,
�I�m quite fed up, and all that rot!
I mean to say a pigsty! What?�

The Sergeant-major, filled with rage,
Attacked the Sergeant at this stage,
�You careless swab! jump to it smart.
Oh strewth! You break my blinkin �eart!�

The Sergeant, starting in to
Apostrophized the Corporal, thus,
�You lazy, lumberin�, boss-eyed lout!
Who chucked this crimson fruit about?�

The Corporal frowned, and turned his eye
On Private Atkins passing by;
�Hi! you! Come �ere, you slobberin� sweep,
Just shift this festerin� rubbish �eap!�

And Private Atkins, filled with gloom,
Applied himself with spade and broom:
�They talk a ruddy lot,� Quothe he,
�But �oo does all the work? Why me�
