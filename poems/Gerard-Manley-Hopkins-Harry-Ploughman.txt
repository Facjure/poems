Hard as hurdle arms, with a broth of goldish flue
Breathed round; the rack of ribs; the scooped flank; lank
Rope-over thigh; knee-nave; and barrelled shank - 
Head and foot, shoulder and shank - 
By a grey eye's heed steered well, one crew, fall to;
Stand at stress. Each limb's barrowy brawn, his thew
That onewhere curded, onewhere sucked or sank - 
 Soared or sank - ,
Though as a beechbole firm, finds his, as at a roll- call, rank
And features, in flesh, what deed he each must do - 
His sinew-service where do.

He leans to it, Harry bends, look. Back, elbow, and liquid waist
In him, all quail to the wallowing o' the plough:'s cheek crimsons; curls
Wag or crossbridle, in a wind lifted, windlaced - 
See his wind- lilylocks -laced;
Churlsgrace, too, child of Amansstrength, how it hangs or hurls
Them - broad in bluff hide his frowning feet lashed! raced
With, along them, cragiron under and cold furls - 
With-a-fountain's shining-shot furls.
