title: All The Wide World Is But The Thought Of You
---

All the wide world is but the thought of you:
Who made you out of wonder and of dew?
Was it some god with tears in his deep eyes,
Who loved a woman white and over-wise,
That strangely put all violets in your hair - 
And put into your face all distance too?
