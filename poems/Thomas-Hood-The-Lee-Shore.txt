title: The Lee Shore.

Sleet! and Hail! and Thunder!
And ye Winds that rave,
Till the sands thereunder
Tinge the sullen wave - 

Winds, that like a Demon,
Howl with horrid note
Round the toiling Seaman,
In his tossing boat - 

From his humble dwelling,
On the shingly shore,
Where the billows swelling,
Keep such hollow roar - 

From that weeping Woman,
Seeking with her cries
Succor superhuman
From the frowning skies - 

From the Urchin pining
For his Father's knee - 
From the lattice shining - 
Drive him out to sea!

Let broad leagues dissever
Him from yonder foam - 
Oh, God! to think Man ever
Comes too near his Home!
