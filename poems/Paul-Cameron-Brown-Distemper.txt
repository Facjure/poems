Looking into the glassy crucifix of water.
slits of rock form stigmata across creviced limestone - 
green pools with an occasional fish passing
air bubbles to the top
the eerie night crumbling under shafts of starlight
with the smell of hemlock pods &amp; cedar bringing
nard and precious stone within
crowns of natural thorn - 
this body of muskeg pressed onto
aromatic herbs then borne away
along the road to a wooded Calvary and
the sense of Christ
in that light at dawn.
