title: The Golden Calf. Translations. After Heine.

Double flutes and horns resound
As they dance the idol round;
Jacob's daughters, madly reeling,
Whirl about the golden calf.
Hear them laugh!
Kettledrums and laughter pealing.

Dresses tucked above their knees,
Maids of noblest families,
In the swift dance blindly wheeling,
Circle in their wild career
Round the steer, -
Kettledrums and laughter pealing.

Aaron's self, the guardian grey
Of the faith, at last gives way,
Madness all his senses stealing;
Prances in his high priest's coat
Like a goat, -
Kettledrums and laughter pealing.
