---

 This Spot, at once unfolding sight so fair
 Of sea and land, with yon grey towers that still
 Rise up as if to lord it over air
 Might soothe in human breasts the sense of ill,
 Or charm it out of memory; yea, might fill
 The heart with joy and gratitude to God
 For all his bounties upon man bestowed:
 Why bears it then the name of "Weeping Hill"?
 Thousands, as toward yon old Lancastrian Towers,
 A prison's crown, along this way they past
 For lingering durance or quick death with shame,
 From this bare eminence thereon have cast
 Their first look blinded as tears fell in showers
 Shed on their chains; and hence that doleful name.
