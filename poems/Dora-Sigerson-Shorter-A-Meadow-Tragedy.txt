title: A Meadow Tragedy
---

 Here�s a meadow full of sunshine
 Ripe grasses lush and high;
 There�s a reaper on the roadway,
 And a lark hangs in the sky.

 There�s a nest of love enclosing
 Three little beaks that cry;
 The reapers in the meadow
 And a lark hangs in the sky.

 Here�s a mead all full of summer,
 And tragedy goes by
 With a knife amongst the grasses,
 And a song up in the sky.
