Life is a house where many chambers be,
 And all the doors will yield to him who tries,
 Save one, whereof men say, behind it lies
The haunting secret.He who keeps the key,

Keeps it securely, smiles perchance to see
 The eager hands stretched out to clutch the prize,
 Or looks with pity in the yearning eyes,
And is half moved to let the secret free.

And truly some at every hour pass through,
 Pass through, and tread upon that solemn floor,
Yet come not back to tell what they have found.
We will not importune, as others do,
 With tears and cries, the keeper of the door,
But wait till our appointed hour comes round.
