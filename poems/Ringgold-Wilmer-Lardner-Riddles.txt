If it's fun to take books from the bookcase,
 If you really believe it's worth while
To carry them out to the kitchen
 And build them all up in a pile,
Why isn't it just as agreeable then
To carry them back to the bookcase again?

If it's fun to make marks with a pencil
 In books that one cares for a heap;
To tear out the pages from volumes
 One likes and is anxious to keep,
Why isn't it pleasure to put on the hummer
A magazine read and discarded last summer?
