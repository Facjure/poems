O praise me not with your lips, dear one!
Though your tender words I prize.
But dearer by far is the soulful gaze
Of your eyes, your beautiful eyes,
 Your tender, loving eyes.

O chide me not with your lips, dear one!
Though I cause your bosom sighs.
You can make repentance deeper far
By your sad, reproving eyes,
 Your sorrowful, troubled eyes.

Words, at the best, are but hollow sounds;
Above, in the beaming skies,
The constant stars say never a word,
But only smile with their eyes - 
 Smile on with their lustrous eyes.

Then breathe no vow with your lips, dear one;
On the wingï¿½d wind speech flies.
But I read the truth of your noble heart
In your soulful, speaking eyes - 
 In your deep and beautiful eyes.
