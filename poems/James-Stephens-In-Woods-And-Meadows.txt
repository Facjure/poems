title: In Woods And Meadows

Play to the tender stops, though cheerily:
 Gently, my soul, my song: let no one hear:
Sing to thyself alone; thine ecstasy
 Rising in silence to the inward ear
That is attuned to silence: do not tell
 A friend, a bird, a star, lest they should say -
 He danced in woods and meadows all the day,
Waving his arms, and cried as evening fell,
 'O, do not come,' and cried, 'O, come, thou queen,
 And walk with me unwatched upon the green
Under the sky.'
