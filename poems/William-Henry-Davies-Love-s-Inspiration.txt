Give me the chance, and I will make
 Thy thoughts of me, like worms this day,
Take wings and change to butterflies
 That in the golden light shall play;
Thy cold, clear heart, the quiet pool
 That never heard Love's nightingale, 
Shall hear his music night and day,
 And in no seasons shall it fail.

I'll make thy happy heart my port,
 Where all my thoughts are anchored fast;
Thy meditations, full of praise,
 The flags of glory on each mast.
I'll make my Soul thy shepherd soon,
 With all thy thoughts my grateful flock;
And thou shalt say, each time I go, 
 How long, my Love, ere thou'lt come back?
