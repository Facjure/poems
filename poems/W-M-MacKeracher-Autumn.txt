The Year, an aged holy priest,
 In gorgeous vestments clad,
Now celebrates the solemn feast
 Of Autumn, sweet and sad.

The Sun, a contrite thurifer
 After his garish days,
Through lessening arch, a wavy blur,
 His burnish'd censer sways.

The Earth, - an altar all afire
 Her hecatombs to claim,
Shoots upward many a golden spire
 And crimson tongue of flame.

Like Jethro's shepherd, when he turn'd
 In Midian's land to view
The bush that unconsuming burn'd,
 I pause - and worship, too.
