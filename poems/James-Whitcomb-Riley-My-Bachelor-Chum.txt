 A corpulent man is my bachelor chum,
With a neck apoplectic and thick -
 An abdomen on him as big as a drum,
And a fist big enough for the stick;
 With a walk that for grace is clear out of the case,
And a wobble uncertain - as though
 His little bow-legs had forgotten the pace
That in youth used to favor him so.

 He is forty, at least; and the top of his head
Is a bald and a glittering thing;
 And his nose and his two chubby cheeks are as red
As three rival roses in spring;

 His mouth is a grin with the corners tucked in,
And his laugh is so breezy and bright
 That it ripples his features and dimples his chin
With a billowy look of delight.

 He is fond of declaring he "don't care a straw" -
That "the ills of a bachelor's life
 Are blisses, compared with a mother-in-law
And a boarding-school miss for a wife!"
 So he smokes and he drinks, and he jokes and he winks,
And he dines and he wines, all alone,
 With a thumb ever ready to snap as he thinks
Of the comforts he never has known.

 But up in his den - (Ah, my bachelor chum!) -
I have sat with him there in the gloom,
 When the laugh of his lips died away to become
But a phantom of mirth in the room.
 And to look on him there you would love him, for all
His ridiculous ways, and be dumb
 As the little girl-face that smiles down from the wall
On the tears of my bachelor chum.
