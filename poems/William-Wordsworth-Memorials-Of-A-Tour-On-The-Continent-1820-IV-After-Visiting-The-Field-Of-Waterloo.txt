 A winged Goddess, clothed in vesture wrought
 Of rainbow colours; One whose port was bold,
 Whose overburthened hand could scarcely hold
 The glittering crowns and garlands which it brought
 Hovered in air above the far-famed Spot.
 She vanished; leaving prospect blank and cold
 Of wind-swept corn that wide around us rolled
 In dreary billows; wood, and meagre cot,
 And monuments that soon must disappear:
 Yet a dread local recompense we found;
 While glory seemed betrayed, while patriot-zeal
 Sank in our hearts, we felt as men 'should' feel
 With such vast hoards of hidden carnage near,
 And horror breathing from the silent ground!
