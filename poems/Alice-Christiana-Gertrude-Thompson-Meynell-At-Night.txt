Home, home from the horizon far and clear,
 Hither the soft wings sweep;
Flocks of the memories of the day draw near
 The dovecote doors of sleep.

O which are they that come through sweetest light
 Of all these homing birds?
Which with the straightest and the swiftest flight?
 Your words to me, your words!
