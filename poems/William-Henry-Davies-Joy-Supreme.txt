The birds are pirates of her notes,
 The blossoms steal her face's light;
The stars in ambush lie all day,
 To take her glances for the night.
Her voice can shame rain-pelted leaves;
 Young robin has no notes as sweet
In autumn, when the air is still,
 And all the other birds are mute.

When I set eyes on ripe, red plums
 That seem a sin and shame to bite,
Such are her lips, which I would kiss,
 And still would keep before my sight.
When I behold proud gossamer
 Make silent billows in the air,
Then think I of her head's fine stuff,
 Finer than gossamer's, I swear.

The miser has his joy, with gold
 Beneath his pillow in the night;
My head shall lie on soft warm hair,
 And miser's know not that delight.
Captains that own their ships can boast
 Their joy to feel the rolling brine, 
But I shall lie near her, and feel
 Her soft warm bosom swell on mine.
