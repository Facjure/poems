title: Charley Over The Water
---

Over the water, and over the lea,
And over the water to Charley;
And Charley loves good ale and wine,
And Charley loves good brandy,
And Charley loves a pretty girl
As sweet as sugar candy.

Over the water and over the sea,
And over the water to Charley;
I'll have none of your nasty beef,
Nor I'll have none of your barley.
But I'll have some of your very best flour
To make a white cake for my Charley.
