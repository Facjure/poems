�So she�s here, your unknown Dulcinea, the lady you met on the train,
And you really believe she would know you if you were to meet her again?�

�Of course,� he replied, �she would know me; there never was womankind yet
Forgot the effect she inspired. She excuses, but does not forget.�

�Then you told her your love?� asked the elder. The younger looked up with a smile:
�I sat by her side half an hour what else was I doing the while?

�What, sit by the side of a woman as fair as the sun in the sky,
And look somewhere else lest the dazzle flash back from your own to her eye?

�No, I hold that the speech of the tongue be as frank and as bold as the look,
And I held up herself to herself, that was more than she got from her book.�

�Young blood!� laughed the elder; �no doubt you are voicing the mode of To-Day:
But then we old fogies at least gave the lady some chance for delay.

�There�s my wife (you must know), we first met on the journey from Florence to Rome:
It took me three weeks to discover who was she and where was her home;

�Three more to be duly presented; three more ere I saw her again;
And a year ere my romance began where yours ended that day on the train.�

�Oh, that was the style of the stage-coach; we travel to-day by express;
Forty miles to the hour,� he answered, �won�t admit of a passion that�s less.�

�But what if you make a mistake?� quoth the elder. The younger half sighed.
�What happens when signals are wrong or switches misplaced?� he replied.

�Very well, I must bow to your wisdom,� the elder returned, �but submit
Your chances of winning this woman your boldness has bettered no whit.

�Why, you do not at best know her name. And what if I try your ideal
With something, if not quite so fair, at least more en regle and real?

�Let me find you a partner. Nay, come, I insist you shall follow this way.
My dear, will you not add your grace to entreat Mr. Rapid to stay?

�My wife, Mr. Rapid Eh, what! Why, he�s gone yet he said he would come.
How rude! I don�t wonder, my dear, you are properly crimson and dumb!�
