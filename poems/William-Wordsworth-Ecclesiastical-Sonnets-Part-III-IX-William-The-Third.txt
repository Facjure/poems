 Calm as an under-current, strong to draw
 Millions of waves into itself, and run,
 From sea to sea, impervious to the sun
 And ploughing storm, the spirit of Nassau
 Swerves not, (how blest if by religious awe
 Swayed, and thereby enabled to contend
 With the wide world's commotions) from its end
 Swerves not, diverted by a casual law.
 Had mortal action e'er a nobler scope?
 The Hero comes to liberate, not defy;
 And, while he marches on with steadfast hope,
 Conqueror beloved! expected anxiously!
 The vacillating Bondman of the Pope
 Shrinks from the verdict of his stedfast eye.
