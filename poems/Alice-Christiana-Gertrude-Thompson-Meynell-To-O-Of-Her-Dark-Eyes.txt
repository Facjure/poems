title: To O-, Of Her Dark Eyes
---

 Across what calm of tropic seas,
�Neath alien clusters of the nights,
 Looked, in the past, such eyes as these?
Long-quenched, relumed, ancestral lights!

 The generations fostered them;
And steadfast Nature, secretwise-
 Thou seedling child of that old stem-
Kindled anew thy dark-bright eyes.

 Was it a century or two
This lovely darkness rose and set,
 Occluded by grey eyes and blue,
And Nature feigning to forget?

 Some grandam gave a hint of it-
So cherished was it in thy race,
 So fine a treasure to transmit
In its perfection to thy face.

 Some father to some mother�s breast
Entrusted it, unknowing.Time
 Implied, or made it manifest,
Bequest of a forgotten clime.

 Hereditary eyes!But this
Is single, singular, apart:-
 New-made thy love, new-made thy kiss,
New-made thy errand to my heart.
