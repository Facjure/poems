 Vague, vague 'neath darkling waves,
 With emerald-curving caves
For the arched skies,
 Red-walled with dark dull gold
 The Nixes' city old
Deep-glimmering lies.
And thro' the long green nights the spangling spars
 Twinkle like milky stars.

 Where the wind-ripple plays
 On tufts of dipping sprays
Sparkling we rock;
 With blooming fingers bare
 Comb down our golden hair
In many a lock;
While, poured o'er naked ease of cool, moist limbs,
 An amber glamour swims.

 Or in the middle night
 When cold damp fire-flies light
Pale flitting brands
 Down all the woodland aisles,
 With swift mysterious smiles
Link we white hands,
And where the moonlight haunts the drowsy lake
 Bask in its silver wake.

 Come join, come join our dance
 While the warm starbeams glance,
And the kind moon
 Spills all her flowers of light
 At the dark feet of Night,
And soon, full soon,
Thou'lt sleep in shadowy halls where dim and cold
 Our city's walled with gold.
