God so loved me that He gave
Jesus for my sins to die;
Jesus loved me in the grave,
Jesus loves me still on high, - 
Father-love and Saviour-love,
Mine on earth and mine above!

Love, from highest heights that stooped, - 
Love, to deepest depths that came, - 
Love, that 'neath my burden drooped, - 
Bore my anguish and my shame - 
Died, that I may never die, - 
Living, lifts me to the sky!

Love, the arm that reached me first, - 
Love, the hand that raised me up, - 
Love, my prison-bars that burst, - 
Love, that filled my brimming cup - 
Filled it full of Heavenly wine - 
Filled, and blessed, and made it mine!

Love, the holy, cleansing fount
Where I wash my garments white, - 
Love, my Tabor, hallowed mount,
Where I stand with Him in sight, - 
Love, my watch-tower, till the day
Chase all earth-born mists away!
