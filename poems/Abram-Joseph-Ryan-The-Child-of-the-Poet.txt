The sunshine of thy Father's fame
 Sleeps in the shadows of thy eyes,
And flashes sometimes when his name
 Like a lost star seeks its skies.

In the horizons of thy heart
 His memory shines for aye,
A light that never shall depart
 Nor lose a single ray.

Thou passest thro' the crowds unknown,
 So gentle, so sweet, and so shy;
Thy heart throbs fast and sometimes may grow low;
Then alone
 Art the star in thy Father's sky.

'Tis fame enough for thee to bear his name --
 Thou couldst not ask for more;
Thou art the jewel of thy Father's fame,
 He waiteth on the bright and golden shore;
He prayeth in the great Eternity
Beside God's throne for thee.
