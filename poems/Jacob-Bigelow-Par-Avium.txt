	 Two little birds were sitting on a stone,
	 One flew away and then there was one,
	 T� other flew away and then there was none,
	 So the poor stone was left all alone.

	 One of the little birds back again flew,
	 In came t� other and then there were two;
	 Says one bird to t� other, �How do you do?�
	 �Very well, I thank you; pray how do you?�

	Fama est par avium venisse insistere saxo,
	Quarum prim� abeunte superstitit inde secunda:
	Illa autem fugiens jam vix vestigia liquit,
	Et saxum m�rens in campo luget inani.

	Ecce autem rediens avium comparuit una,
	Altera non segnis sociam complectitur almam:
	Arrept�que manu, �Quid agis dulcissima rerum?�
	�Suaviter ut nunc est, et jam cupio omnia qu� vis.�
