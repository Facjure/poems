 The farmer's patient care and toil
 Are oftener wanting than the soil.

 A wealthy ploughman drawing near his end,
 Call'd in his sons apart from every friend,
 And said, 'When of your sire bereft,
 The heritage our fathers left
 Guard well, nor sell a single field.
 A treasure in it is conceal'd:
 The place, precisely, I don't know,
 But industry will serve to show.
 The harvest past, Time's forelock take,
 And search with plough, and spade, and rake;
 Turn over every inch of sod,
 Nor leave unsearch'd a single clod.'
 The father died. The sons - and not in vain - 
 Turn'd o'er the soil, and o'er again;
 That year their acres bore
 More grain than e'er before.
 Though hidden money found they none,
 Yet had their father wisely done,
 To show by such a measure,
 That toil itself is treasure.
