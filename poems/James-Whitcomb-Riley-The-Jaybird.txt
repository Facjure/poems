 The Jaybird he's my favorite
Of all the birds they is!
 I think he's quite a stylish sight
In that blue suit of his:
 An' when he' lights an' shuts his wings,
His coat's a "cutaway" - 
 I guess it's only when he sings
You'd know he wuz a jay.

 I like to watch him when he's lit
In top of any tree,
 'Cause all birds git wite out of it
When he 'lights, an' they see
 How proud he act', an' swell an' spread
His chest out more an' more,
 An' raise the feathers on his head
Like it's cut pompadore!
