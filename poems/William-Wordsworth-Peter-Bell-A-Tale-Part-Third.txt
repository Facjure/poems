 PART THIRD

 I've heard of one, a gentle Soul,
 Though given to sadness and to gloom,
 And for the fact will vouch, one night
 It chanced that by a taper's light
 This man was reading in his room; 

 Bending, as you or I might bend
 At night o'er any pious book,
 When sudden blackness overspread
 The snow-white page on which he read,
 And made the good man round him look.

 The chamber walls were dark all round, 
 And to his book he turned again;
 The light had left the lonely taper,
 And formed itself upon the paper
 Into large letters bright and plain! 

 The godly book was in his hand 
 And, on the page, more black than coal,
 Appeared, set forth in strange array,
 A 'word' which to his dying day
 Perplexed the good man's gentle soul.

 The ghostly word, thus plainly seen,
 Did never from his lips depart;
 But he hath said, poor gentle wight!
 It brought full many a sin to light
 Out of the bottom of his heart. 

 Dread Spirits! to confound the meek
 Why wander from your course so far,
 Disordering colour, form, and stature!
 Let good men feel the soul of nature,
 And see things as they are.

 Yet, potent Spirits! well I know,
 How ye, that play with soul and sense,
 Are not unused to trouble friends
 Of goodness, for most gracious ends 
 And this I speak in reverence! 

 But might I give advice to you,
 Whom in my fear I love so well;
 From men of pensive virtue go,
 Dread Beings! and your empire show
 On hearts like that of Peter Bell.

 Your presence often have I felt
 In darkness and the stormy night;
 And, with like force, if need there be,
 Ye can put forth your agency
 When earth is calm, and heaven is bright. 

 Then, coming from the wayward world,
 That powerful world in which ye dwell,
 Come, Spirits of the Mind! and try
 To-night, beneath the moonlight sky,
 What may be done with Peter Bell!

 O, would that some more skilful voice
 My further labour might prevent!
 Kind Listeners, that around me sit,
 I feel that I am all unfit
 For such high argument. 

 I've played, I've danced, with my narration;
 I loitered long ere I began:
 Ye waited then on my good pleasure;
 Pour out indulgence still, in measure
 As liberal as ye can!

 Our Travellers, ye remember well,
 Are thridding a sequestered lane;
 And Peter many tricks is trying,
 And many anodynes applying,
 To ease his conscience of its pain. 

 By this his heart is lighter far;
 And, finding that he can account
 So snugly for that crimson stain,
 His evil spirit up again
 Does like an empty bucket mount.

 And Peter is a deep logician
 Who hath no lack of wit mercurial;
 "Blood drops leaves rustle yet," quoth he,
 "This poor man never, but for me,
 Could have had Christian burial. 

 "And, say the best you can, 'tis plain,
 That here has been some wicked dealing;
 No doubt the devil in me wrought;
 I'm not the man who could have thought
 An Ass like this was worth the stealing!"

 So from his pocket Peter takes
 His shining horn tobacco-box;
 And, in a light and careless way,
 As men who with their purpose play,
 Upon the lid he knocks. 

 Let them whose voice can stop the clouds,
 Whose cunning eye can see the wind,
 Tell to a curious world the cause
 Why, making here a sudden pause,
 The Ass turned round his head, and 'grinned'.

 Appalling process! I have marked
 The like on heath, in lonely wood;
 And, verily, have seldom met
 A spectacle more hideous yet
 It suited Peter's present mood. 

 And, grinning in his turn, his teeth
 He in jocose defiance showed 
 When, to upset his spiteful mirth,
 A murmur, pent within the earth,
 In the dead earth beneath the road

 Rolled audibly! it swept along,
 A muffled noise a rumbling sound! 
 'Twas by a troop of miners made,
 Plying with gunpowder their trade,
 Some twenty fathoms under ground. 

 Small cause of dire effect! for, surely,
 If ever mortal, King or Cotter,
 Believed that earth was charged to quake
 And yawn for his unworthy sake,
 'Twas Peter Bell the Potter.

 But, as an oak in breathless air
 Will stand though to the centre hewn;
 Or as the weakest things, if frost
 Have stiffened them, maintain their post;
 So he, beneath the gazing moon! 

 The Beast bestriding thus, he reached
 A spot where, in a sheltering cove,
 A little chapel stands alone,
 With greenest ivy overgrown,
 And tufted with an ivy grove;

 Dying insensibly away
 From human thoughts and purposes,
 It seemed wall, window, roof and tower 
 To bow to some transforming power,
 And blend with the surrounding trees. 

 As ruinous a place it was,
 Thought Peter, in the shire of Fife
 That served my turn, when following still
 From land to land a reckless will
 I married my sixth wife!

 The unheeding Ass moves slowly on,
 And now is passing by an inn
 Brim-full of a carousing crew,
 That make, with curses not a few,
 An uproar and a drunken din. 

 I cannot well express the thoughts
 Which Peter in those noises found; 
 A stifling power compressed his frame,
 While-as a swimming darkness came
 Over that dull and dreary sound.

 For well did Peter know the sound;
 The language of those drunken joys
 To him, a jovial soul, I ween,
 But a few hours ago, had been
 A gladsome and a welcome noise. 

 'Now', turned adrift into the past,
 He finds no solace in his course;
 Like planet-stricken men of yore,
 He trembles, smitten to the core
 By strong compunction and remorse.

 But, more than all, his heart is stung
 To think of one, almost a child;
 A sweet and playful Highland girl,
 As light and beauteous as a squirrel,
 As beauteous and as wild! 

 Her dwelling was a lonely house,
 A cottage in a heathy dell;
 And she put on her gown of green,
 And left her mother at sixteen,
 And followed Peter Bell.

 But many good and pious thoughts
 Had she; and, in the kirk to pray,
 Two long Scotch miles, through rain or snow
 To kirk she had been used to go,
 Twice every Sabbath-day. 

 And, when she followed Peter Bell,
 It was to lead an honest life;
 For he, with tongue not used to falter,
 Had pledged his troth before the altar
 To love her as his wedded wife.

 A mother's hope is hers; but soon
 She drooped and pined like one forlorn;
 From Scripture she a name did borrow;
 Benoni, or the child of sorrow,
 She called her babe unborn. 

 For she had learned how Peter lived,
 And took it in most grievous part;
 She to the very bone was worn,
 And, ere that little child was born,
 Died of a broken heart.

 And now the Spirits of the Mind
 Are busy with poor Peter Bell;
 Upon the rights of visual sense
 Usurping, with a prevalence
 More terrible than magic spell. 

 Close by a brake of flowering furze
 (Above it shivering aspens play)
 He sees an unsubstantial creature,
 His very self in form and feature,
 Not four yards from the broad highway:

 And stretched beneath the furze he sees
 The Highland girl it is no other;
 And hears her crying as she cried,
 The very moment that she died,
 "My mother! oh my mother!" 

 The sweat pours down from Peter's face,
 So grievous is his heart's contrition;
 With agony his eye-balls ache
 While he beholds by the furze-brake
 This miserable vision!

 Calm is the well-deserving brute,
 'His' peace hath no offence betrayed;
 But now, while down that slope he wends,
 A voice to Peter's ear ascends,
 Resounding from the woody glade: 

 The voice, though clamorous as a horn
 Re-echoed by a naked rock,
 Comes from that tabernacle List!
 Within, a fervent Methodist
 Is preaching to no heedless flock!

 "Repent! repent!" he cries aloud,
 "While yet ye may find mercy; strive
 To love the Lord with all your might;
 Turn to him, seek him day and night,
 And save your souls alive! 

 "Repent! repent! though ye have gone,
 Through paths of wickedness and woe,
 After the Babylonian harlot;
 And, though your sins be red as scarlet,
 They shall be white as snow!"

 Even as he passed the door, these words
 Did plainly come to Peter's ears;
 And they such joyful tidings were,
 The joy was more than he could bear! 
 He melted into tears. 

 Sweet tears of hope and tenderness!
 And fast they fell, a plenteous shower!
 His nerves, his sinews seemed to melt;
 Through all his iron frame was felt
 A gentle, a relaxing, power!

 Each fibre of his frame was weak;
 Weak all the animal within;
 But, in its helplessness, grew mild
 And gentle as an infant child,
 An infant that has known no sin. 

 'Tis said, meek Beast! that, through Heaven's grace,
 He not unmoved did notice now
 The cross upon thy shoulder scored,
 For lasting impress, by the Lord
 To whom all human-kind shall bow;

 Memorial of his touch that day
 When Jesus humbly deigned to ride,
 Entering the proud Jerusalem,
 By an immeasurable stream
 Of shouting people deified! 

 Meanwhile the persevering Ass,
 Turned towards a gate that hung in view
 Across a shady lane; his chest
 Against the yielding gate he pressed
 And quietly passed through.

 And up the stony lane he goes;
 No ghost more softly ever trod;
 Among the stones and pebbles, he
 Sets down his hoofs inaudibly,
 As if with felt his hoofs were shod. 

 Along the lane the trusty Ass
 Went twice two hundred yards or more,
 And no one could have guessed his aim, 
 Till to a lonely house he came,
 And stopped beside the door.

 Thought Peter, 'tis the poor man's home!
 He listens not a sound is heard
 Save from the trickling household rill;
 But, stepping o'er the cottage-sill,
 Forthwith a little Girl appeared. 

 She to the Meeting-house was bound
 In hopes some tidings there to gather:
 No glimpse it is, no doubtful gleam;
 She saw and uttered with a scream,
 "My father! here's my father!"

 The very word was plainly heard,
 Heard plainly by the wretched Mother 
 Her joy was like a deep affright:
 And forth she rushed into the light,
 And saw it was another! 

 And, instantly, upon the earth,
 Beneath the full moon shining bright,
 Close to the Ass's feet she fell;
 At the same moment Peter Bell
 Dismounts in most unhappy plight.

 As he beheld the Woman lie
 Breathless and motionless, the mind
 Of Peter sadly was confused;
 But, though to such demands unused,
 And helpless almost as the blind, 

 He raised her up; and, while he held
 Her body propped against his knee,
 The Woman waked and when she spied
 The poor Ass standing by her side,
 She moaned most bitterly.

 "Oh! God be praised my heart's at ease 
 For he is dead I know it well!"
 At this she wept a bitter flood;
 And, in the best way that he could,
 His tale did Peter tell. 

 He trembles he is pale as death;
 His voice is weak with perturbation;
 He turns aside his head, he pauses;
 Poor Peter, from a thousand causes,
 Is crippled sore in his narration.

 At length she learned how he espied
 The Ass in that small meadow-ground;
 And that her Husband now lay dead,
 Beside that luckless river's bed
 In which he had been drowned. 

 A piercing look the Widow cast
 Upon the Beast that near her stands;
 She sees 'tis he, that 'tis the same;
 She calls the poor Ass by his name,
 And wrings, and wrings her hands.

 "O wretched loss untimely stroke!
 If he had died upon his bed!
 He knew not one forewarning pain;
 He never will come home again 
 Is dead, for ever dead!" 

 Beside the woman Peter stands;
 His heart is opening more and more;
 A holy sense pervades his mind;
 He feels what he for human kind
 Had never felt before.

 At length, by Peter's arm sustained,
 The Woman rises from the ground 
 "Oh, mercy! something must be done,
 My little Rachel, you must run, 
 Some willing neighbour must be found. 

 "Make haste my little Rachel do,
 The first you meet with bid him come,
 Ask him to lend his horse to-night,
 And this good Man, whom Heaven requite,
 Will help to bring the body home."

 Away goes Rachel weeping loud; 
 An Infant, waked by her distress,
 Makes in the house a piteous cry;
 And Peter hears the Mother sigh,
 "Seven are they, and all fatherless!" 

 And now is Peter taught to feel
 That man's heart is a holy thing;
 And Nature, through a world of death,
 Breathes into him a second breath,
 More searching than the breath of spring.

 Upon a stone the Woman sits
 In agony of silent grief 
 From his own thoughts did Peter start;
 He longs to press her to his heart,
 From love that cannot find relief. 

 But roused, as if through every limb
 Had past a sudden shock of dread,
 The Mother o'er the threshold flies,
 And up the cottage stairs she hies,
 And on the pillow lays her burning head.

 And Peter turns his steps aside
 Into a shade of darksome trees,
 Where he sits down, he knows not how,
 With his hands pressed against his brow,
 His elbows on his tremulous knees. 

 There, self-involved, does Peter sit
 Until no sign of life he makes,
 As if his mind were sinking deep
 Through years that have been long asleep
 The trance is passed away he wakes;

 He lifts his head and sees the Ass
 Yet standing in the clear moonshine;
 "When shall I be as good as thou?
 Oh! would, poor beast, that I had now
 A heart but half as good as thine!" 

 But 'He' who deviously hath sought
 His Father through the lonesome woods,
 Hath sought, proclaiming to the ear
 Of night his grief and sorrowful fear 
 He comes, escaped from fields and floods; 

 With weary pace is drawing nigh;
 He sees the Ass and nothing living
 Had ever such a fit of joy
 As hath this little orphan Boy,
 For he has no misgiving!

 Forth to the gentle Ass he springs,
 And up about his neck he climbs;
 In loving words he talks to him,
 He kisses, kisses face and limb, 
 He kisses him a thousand times!

 This Peter sees, while in the shade
 He stood beside the cottage-door;
 And Peter Bell, the ruffian wild,
 Sobs loud, he sobs even like a child,
 "O God! I can endure no more!"

 Here ends my Tale: for in a trice
 Arrived a neighbour with his horse;
 Peter went forth with him straightway;
 And, with due care, ere break of day,
 Together they brought back the Corse.

 And many years did this poor Ass,
 Whom once it was my luck to see
 Cropping the shrubs of Leming-Lane,
 Help by his labour to maintain
 The Widow and her family.

 And Peter Bell, who, till that night,
 Had been the wildest of his clan,
 Forsook his crimes, renounced his folly,
 And, after ten months' melancholy,
 Became a good and honest man.
