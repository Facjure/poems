Ne commonentem recta sperne.�Buchanan.


Despise not my good counsel.


He who sits from day to day
Where the prison�d lark is hung,
Heedless of his loudest lay,
Hardly knows that he has sung.


Where the watchman in his round
Nightly lifts his voice on high,
None, accustom�d to the sound,
Wakes the sooner for his cry.


So your verse-man I, and clerk,
Yearly in my song proclaim
Death at hand�yourselves his mark�
And the foe�s unerring aim.


Duly at my time I come,
Publishing to all aloud�
Soon the grave must be your home,
And your only suit, a shroud.


But the monitory strain,
Oft repeated in your ears,
Seems to sound too much in vain,
Wins no notice, wakes no fears.


Can a truth, by all confess�d
Of such magnitude and weight,
Grow, by being oft impress�d,
Trivial as a parrot�s prate?


Pleasure�s call attention wins,
Hear it often as we may;
New as ever seem our sins,
Though committed every day.


Death and judgment, heaven and hell�
These alone, so often heard,
No more move us than the bell
When some stranger is interr�d.


O then, ere the turf or tomb
Cover us from every eye,
Spirit of instruction, come,
Make us learn that we must die.
