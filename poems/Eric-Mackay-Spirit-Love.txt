How great my joy! How grand my recompense!
 I bow to thee; I keep thee in my sight.
I call thee mine, in love though not in sense
I share with thee the hermitage immense
 Of holy dreams which come to us at night,
When, through the medium of the spirit-lens
 We see the soul, in its primeval light,
 And Reason spares the hopes it cannot blight.
It is the soul of thee, and not the form,
 And not the face, I yearn-to in my sleep.
It is thyself. The body is the storm,
 The soul the star beyond it in the deep
 Of Nature's calm. And yonder on the steep
The Sun of Faith, quiescent, round, and warm!
