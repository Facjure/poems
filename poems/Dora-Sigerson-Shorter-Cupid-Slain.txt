 I come from a burial;
 Hush! let me be:
 I have put away my love,
 Fair exceedingly.

 Ah! the little gold curls
 Soft about his face;
 Now my heart is sorrowful
 For his sleeping-place.

 But he would pursue me,
 Never let me rest;
 Till I turned and slew him,
 Knowing it were best.

 Laid his bow beside him,
 Shovelled in the clay;
 To-morrow Iï¿½ll forget him;
 Let me weep to-day.
