Sequestered in their calm domestic bower,
 They sat together.He in manhood's prime
And she a matron in her fullest flower.
 The mantel clock gave forth a warning chime.
She put her work aside; his bright cigar
 Grew pale, and crumbled in an ashen heap.
The lights went out, save one remaining star
 That watched beside the children in their sleep.
She hummed a little song and nestled near,
 As side by side they went to their repose.
His arm about her waist, he whispered "Dear,"
 And pressed his lips upon her mouth's full rose - 
The sacred sweetness of their wedded life
 Breathed in that kiss of husband and of wife.
