title: Lines On A Sleeping Infant.
---

Sweet babe! whose image here express�d
Does thy peaceful slumbers show;
Guilt or fear, to break thy rest,
Never did thy spirit know.


Soothing slumbers! soft repose,
Such as mock the painter�s skill,
Such as innocence bestows,
Harmless infant! lull thee still.
