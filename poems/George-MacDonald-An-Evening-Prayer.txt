I am a bubble
 Upon thy ever-moving, resting sea:
Oh, rest me now from tossing, trespass, trouble!
 Take me down into thee.

Give me thy peace.
 My heart is aching with unquietness:
Oh, make its inharmonious beating cease!
 Thy hand upon it press.

My Night! my Day!
 Swift night and day betwixt, my world doth reel:
Potter, take not thy hand from off the clay
 That whirls upon thy wheel.

O Heart, I cry
 For love and life, pardon and hope and strength!
O Father, I am thine; I shall not die,
 But I shall sleep at length!
