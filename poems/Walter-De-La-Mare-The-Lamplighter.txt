 When the light of day declineth,
 And a swift angel through the sky
 Kindleth God's tapers clear,
 With ashen staff the lamplighter
 Passeth along the darkling streets
 To light our earthly lamps;

 Lest, prowling in the darkness,
 The thief should haunt with quiet tread,
 Or men on evil errands set;
 Or wayfarers be benighted;
 Or neighbours bent from house to house
 Should need a guiding torch.

 He is like a needlewoman
 Who deftly on a sable hem
 Stitches in gleaming jewels;
 Or, haply, he is like a hero,
 Whose bright deeds on the long journey
 Are beacons on our way.

 And when in the East cometh morning,
 And the broad splendour of the sun,
 Then, with the tune of little birds
 Ringing on high, the lamplighter
 Passeth by each quiet house,
 And putteth out the lamps.
