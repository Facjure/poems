S. M. A.



Gone! and there's not a gleam of you,
 Faces that float into far away;
Gone! and we can only dream of you
 Each as you fade like a star away.
Fade as a star in the sky from us,
 Vainly we look for your light again;
Hear ye the sound of a sigh from us?
 "Come!" and our hearts will be bright again.

Come! and gaze on our face once more,
 Bring us the smiles of the olden days;
Come! and shine in your place once more,
 And change the dark into golden days.
Gone! gone! gone! Joy is fled for us;
 Gone into the night of the nevermore,
And darkness rests where you shed for us
 A light we will miss ~forevermore~.

Faces! ye come in the night to us;
 Shadows! ye float in the sky of sleep;
Shadows! ye bring nothing bright to us;
 Faces! ye are but the sigh of sleep.
Gone! and there's not a gleam of you,
 Faces that float into the far away;
Gone! and we only can dream of you
 Till we sink like you and the stars away.
