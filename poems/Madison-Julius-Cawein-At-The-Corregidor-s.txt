To Don Odora says Donna De Vine:
 "I yield to thy long endeavor! 
At my balcony be on the stroke of nine,
 And, Signor, am thine forever!"

This beauty but once had the Don descried
 As she quit the confessional; followed;
"What a foot for silk! a face for a bride 
 Hem!" the rest Odora swallowed.

And with vows as soft as his oaths were sweet
 Her heart he barricaded;
And pressed this point with a present meet,
 And that point serenaded.

What else could the enemy do but yield
 To a handsome importuning!
A gallant blade with a lute for shield
 All night at her lattice mooning!

"Que es estrella! O lily of girls!
 Here's that for thy fierce duenna:
A purse of pistoles and a rosary o' pearls
 And gold as yellow as henna.

"She will drop from thy balcony's rail, my sweet!
 My seraph! this silken ladder;
And then, sweet then! my soul at thy feet
 No lover of lovers gladder!"

And the end of it was! But I will not say
 How he won to the room of the lady: 
Ah! to love is life and to live is gay,
 For the rest, a maravedi!

Now comes her betrothed from the wars, and he,
 A Count of the Court Castilian,
A Don Diabolus, sword at knee,
 And moustaches, uncivilian.

And his is a jealous love; and for
 He marks that this marriage makes sadder 
He watches, and sees a robber to her,
 Or gallant, ascend a ladder.

So he pushes inquiry unto her room,
 With his naked sword demanding 
An Alquazil with the face of Doom,
 Sure of a stout withstanding.

And weapon to weapon they foined and fought;
 Diabolus' thrusts were vicious;
Three thrusts to the floor Odora had brought,
 A fourth was more malicious,

Through the offered bosom of Donna De Vine 
 And this is the Count's condition ...
Was he right, was he wrong? the question is mine,
 To judge, for the Inquisition.
