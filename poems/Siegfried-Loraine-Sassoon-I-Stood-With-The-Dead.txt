title: I Stood With The Dead
---

I stood with the Dead, so forsaken and still:
 When dawn was grey I stood with the Dead.
And my slow heart said, "You must kill; you must kill:
 Soldier, soldier, morning is red."

On the shapes of the slain in their crumpled disgrace
 I stared for a while through the thin cold rain....
"O lad that I loved, there is rain on your face,
 And your eyes are blurred and sick like the plain."

I stood with the Dead.... They were dead; they were dead;
 My heart and my head beat a march of dismay;
And gusts of the wind came dulled by the guns....
 "Fall in!" I shouted; "Fall in for your pay!"
