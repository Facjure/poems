 Bird of the morn,
 When roseate clouds begin
 To show the opening dawn
 Thou gladly sing'st it in,
 And o'er the sweet green fields and happy vales
 Thy pleasant song is heard, mixed with the morning gales.

 Bird of the morn,
 What time the ruddy sun
 Smiles on the pleasant corn
 Thy singing is begun,
 Heartfelt and cheering over labourers' toil,
 Who chop in coppice wild and delve the russet soil.

 Bird of the sun,
 How dear to man art thou!
 When morning has begun
 To gild the mountain's brow,
 How beautiful it is to see thee soar so blest,
 Winnowing thy russet wings above thy twitchy nest.

 Bird of the Summer's day,
 How oft I stand to hear
 Thee sing thy airy lay,
 With music wild and clear,
 Till thou becom'st a speck upon the sky,
 Small as the clods that crumble where I lie.

 Thou bird of happiest song,
 The Spring and Summer too
 Are thine, the months along,
 The woods and vales to view.
 If climes were evergreen thy song would be
 The sunny music of eternal glee.
