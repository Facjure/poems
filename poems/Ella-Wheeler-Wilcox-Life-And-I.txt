title: Life And I.
---

Life and I are lovers, straying
Arm in arm along:
Often like two children Maying,
Full of mirth and song.

Life plucks all the blooming hours
Growing by the way;
Binds them on my brow like flowers;
Calls me Queen of May.

Then again, in rainy weather,
We sit vis-a-vis,
Planning work we'll do together
In the years to be.

Sometimes Life denies me blisses,
And I frown or pout;
But we make it up with kisses
Ere the day is out.

Woman-like, I sometimes grieve him,
Try his trust and faith,
Saying I shall one day leave him
For his rival Death.

Then he always grows more zealous,
Tender, and more true;
Loves the more for being jealous,
As all lovers do.

Though I swear by stars above him,
And by worlds beyond,
That I love him - love him - love him;
Though my heart is fond;

Though he gives me, doth my lover,
Kisses with each breath - 
I shall one day throw him over,
And plight troth with Death.
