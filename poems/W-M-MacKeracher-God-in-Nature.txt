We see our Father's hand in all around;
 In summer's sun, and in cold winter's snow,
In leafy wood, on grassy-covered ground,
 In showers that fall and icy blasts that blow.
And when we see the light'ning's flash, and hear
 The thunder's roar, majestically grand,
A heavenly voice says, "Christian, do not fear,
 'Tis but the working of thy Father's hand."
