The general �eard the firin� on the flank,
An� �e sent a mounted man to bring �im back
The silly, pushin� person�s name an� rank
�Oo�d dared to answer Brother Boer�s attack:
For there might �ave been a serious engagement,
An� �e might �ave wasted �alf a dozen men;
So �e ordered �im to stop �is operations round the kopjes,
An� �e told �im off before the Staff at ten!
And it all goes into the laundry,
But it never comes out in the wash,
�Ow we�re sugared about by the old men
(�Eavy sterned amateur old men!)
That �amper an� �inder an� scold men
For fear o� Stellenbosh!*

The General �ad �produced a great effect,�
The General �ad the country cleared, almost;
The General ��ad no reason to expect,�
And the Boers �ad us bloomin� well on toast!
For we might �ave crossed the drift before the twilight,
Instead o� sitting down an� takin� root;
But we was not allowed, so the Boojers scooped the crowd,
To the last survivin� bandolier an� boot.

The General saw the farm�ouse in �is rear,
With its stoep so nicely shaded from the sun;
Sez �e, �I�ll pitch my tabernacle �ere,�
An� �e kept us muckin� round till �e �ad done.
For �e might �ave caught the confluent pneumonia
From sleepin� in his gaiters in the dew;
So �e took a book an� dozed while the other columns closed
And De Wet�s commando out an� trickled through!

The General saw the mountain-range ahead,
With their �elios showin� saucy on the �eight,
So �e �eld us to the level ground instead,
An� telegraphed the Boojers would n�t fight.
For �e might �ave gone an� sprayed �em with a pompom,
Or �e might �ave slung a squadron out to see,
But�e was n�t takin� chances in them �igh an� �ostile kranzes,
He was markin� time to earn a K.C.B

The General got �is decorations thick
(The men that backed �is lies could not complain),
The Staff �ad D.S.O.�s till we was sick,
An� the soldier, �ad the work to do again!
For �e might �ave known the District was an �otbed,
Instead of �andin� over, upside-down,
To a man �oo �ad to fight �alf a year to put it right,
While the General went an� slandered �im in town!

An� it all went into the laundry,
But it never came out in the wash.
We were sugared about by the old men
(Panicky, perishin� old men)
That �amper an� �inder an� scold men
For fear o� Stellenbosh!
