title: To The Reader Of This Book
---

This little book's a letter,
I send direct to you;
I hope that you will like it,
And read it thru and thru.
And after you have read it,
Just send a thot to me;
Your thots will help to make me
The "Poet" I would be.

 Yours very truly,

ALAN L. STRANG,

 Redwood City, California.
