I was the slyest boy at home,
 The slyest boy at school,
I wanted all the world to know
 That I was no one's fool.

I kept my childish hopes and schemes
 Locked closely in my breast,
No single secret shared with Bob,
 The chum I liked the best.

I never showed my squirrel's nest,
 Nor beaver dam, nor cave,
Nor fortress where I used to go
 To be a soldier brave.

Oh, I was sly, just awful sly,
 In winter, summer, spring,
While Bob would tell me all he knew,
 I never told a thing.

And yet Bob always got ahead;
 I'd find the careless knave
Asleep within my fortress walls,
 And fishing in my cave.

"What, yours!" he said, in great surprise,
 "You should have told me so.
You never said a word, old chum,
 And how was I to know?"

My slyness hurt more than it helped;
 If Bob had known, you see,
He was too kind to do his best
 To get ahead of me.

I still was sly when I grew up.
 I fell in love with Nan,
But scorned to own it to myself
 Or any other man.

So sly was I, Nan never guessed - 
 No more did handsome Bob - 
That every time she looked my way
 My heart, it stirred and throbbed.

The same old story! Ere I knew,
 My chum had loved and won.
When I explained I'd picked her out
 To be my very own,

"What, yours!" he said in great surprise,
 "You should have told me so.
You never said a word, old chum,
 And how was I to know?"

I've learned my lesson, lost my girl;
 You'll own 'tis rather rough.
Henceforward I'll not be too sly - 
 I'll be just sly enough.
