title: Mad Poll

There goes mad Poll, dressed in wild flowers,
 Poor, crazy Poll, now old and wan;
Her hair all down, like any child:
 She swings her two arms like a man.

Poor, crazy Poll is never sad,
 She never misses one that dies;
When neighbours show their new-born babes,
 They seem familiar to her eyes.

Her bonnet's always in her hand,
 Or on the ground, and lying near;
She thinks it is a thing for play,
 Or pretty show, and not to wear.

She gives the sick no sympathy,
 She never soothes a child that cries;
She never whimpers, night or day,
 She makes no moans, she makes no sighs.

She talks about some battle old,
 Fought many a day from yesterday;
And when that war is done, her love, 
 "Ha, ha!" Poll laughs, and skips away.
