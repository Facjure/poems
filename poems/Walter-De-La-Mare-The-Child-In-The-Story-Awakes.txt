 The light of dawn rose on my dreams,
And from afar I seemed to hear
 In sleep the mellow blackbird call
Hollow and sweet and clear.

 I prythee, Nurse, my casement open,
Wildly the garden peals with singing,
 And hooting through the dewy pines
The goblins all are winging.

 O listen the droning of the bees,
That in the roses take delight!
 And see a cloud stays in the blue
Like an angel still and bright.

 The gentle sky is spread like silk,
And, Nurse, the moon doth languish there,
 As if it were a perfect jewel
In the morning's soft-spun hair.

 The greyness of the distant hills
Is silvered in the lucid East,
 See, now the sheeny-plumï¿½d cock
Wags haughtily his crest.

 'O come you out, O come you out,
Lily, and lavender, and lime;
 The kingcup swings his golden bell,
And plumpy cherries drum the time.

 'O come you out, O come you out!
Roses, and dew, and mignonette,
 The sun is in the steep blue sky,
Sweetly the morning star is set.'
