There's dew upon the meadows,
 An' bats are wheelin' high;
The sun has set an hour sin',
 An' evenin' leet's i' t' sky.
Swalows i' t' thack are sleepin ,
 Neet-hawks are swift on t' wing,
An' grey moths gethers honey
 Amang the purple ling.
O coom an' meet me, Mally,
O coom an' greet me, Mally,
 Meet me, greet me, at the courtin' gate.

The fire-leet casts thy shadow
 Owerthwart the kitchen wall;
It's dancin' up an' doon, lass,
 My heart does dance an' all.
Three times I've gien oor love-call
 To bring my bird to t' nest.
When wilt a coom, my throstle,
 An' shelter on my breast?
O coom an' meet me, Mally,
O coom an' greet me, Mally,
 Meet me, greet me, at the courtin' gate.

I've wrowt all t' day at t' harvist,
 But ivery hour seemed sweet,
Acause I thowt I'd haud thee
 Clasped i' my airms to-neet.
Black Bess she raked aside me
 An' leuked at me an' smiled;
I telled her I loved Mally,
 It made her despert wild.
O coom an' meet me, Mally,
O coom an' greet me, Mally,
 Meet me, greet me, at the courtin' gate.

Thy shadow's gone frae t' kitchen,
 T' hoose-door is oppened wide.
It's she, my viewly Mally,
 The lass I'll mak my bride.
White lilies in her garden,
 Fling oot your scent i' t' air,
An' mingle breath wi' t' roses
 I've gethered for her hair.
O let me haud thee, Mally,
O let me faud thee, Mally,
 Haud thee, faud thee, at the courtin' gate.
