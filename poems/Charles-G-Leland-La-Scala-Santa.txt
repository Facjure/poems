�Robusti sono i fatti.�
- Discorso del Terremoto,
del S. Alessandro Sardo.
Venetia, A.D. 1586.

In San Gianni Lateran,
Dey�ve cot a flight of shdairs,
More woonderful ash nefer vas,
As Latin pooks declares.
For you kits your sins forgifen,
If you glimes dem knee py knee;
It�s such a gitten up a stairs,
I nefer yet did see.

Now as Breitmann vas a vaitin
Among some demi reps,
Ascensionem expectans,
To see dem glime de steps,
Dere came a sinful scoffer,
Who his mind had firmly set
To go dem holy sdairs afoot,
Und do it on a bet!

Boot shoost as he vas startet,
To make dis sassy go,
Der Breitmann caught him py de neck,
Und tripped him off his toe!
Und den dere come de skience,
A la prenez gardez vous;
For he bung his eye and bust his shell,
Und shplit his noshe in dwo.

De briests vere so astonish,
To see him lam de man,
Dat dey shvore a holy miracle
Vas vork by Breitemann.
Says Breitmann, �I�m a heretic,
But dis you may pe bound,
No chap shall mock relishious dings
Vhile I�m a bummin round.

�Und you owes me really noding,
For as I�ll plainly show,
At last I�ve found out someding
Vot I alfays vant to know.
Und now dat I have found it,
In de newspapers I�ll brag:
Evviva! Ho trovato,
Vot means a Scala-Wag.�
