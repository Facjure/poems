 Little elfin maid,
Old, though scarce two years,
 With your big dark hazel eyes
Tenderer than tears,

 And your rosebud mouth
Lisping jocund things,
 Breaking brooding silence with
Wistful questionings!

 Like a flower you grew
While life's bright sun shone.
 Does the greedy spendthrift earth
Heed a flower is gone?

 No; but Love's fond ken,
That gropes through Death's strange ways,
 Almost seems to hear your Voice,
Seems to see your Face!
