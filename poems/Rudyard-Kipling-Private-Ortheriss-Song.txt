My girl she give me the go onest,
When I was a London lad;
An� I went on the drink for a fortnight,
An� then I went to the bad.
The Queen she give me a shillin�
To fight for �er over the seas;
But Guv�ment built me a fever-trap,
An� Injia give me disease.

(Chorus) Ho! don�t you �eed what a girl says,
An� don�t you go for the beer;
But I was an ass when I was at grass,
An� that is why I�m �ere.

I fired a shot at a Afghan,
The beggar �e fired again,
An� I lay on my bed with a �ole in my �ed,
An� missed the next campaign!
I up with my gun at a Burman
Who carried a bloomin� dah,
But the cartridge stuck and the bay�nit bruk,
An� all I got was the scar.

(Chorus) Ho! don�t you aim at a Afghan,
When you stand on the skyline clear;
An� don�t you go for a Burman
If none o� your friends is near.

I served my time for a Corp�ral,
An� wetted my stripes with pop,
For I went on the bend with a intimate friend,
An� finished the night in the �shop.�
I served my time for a Sergeant;
The Colonel �e sez �No!
The most you�ll see is a full C.B.�
An� . . . very next night �twas so!

(Chorus) Ho! don�t you go for a Corp�ral
Unless your �ed is clear;
But I was an ass when I was at grass,
An� that is why I�m �ere.

I�ve tasted the luck o� the Army
In barrack an� camp an� clink,
An� I lost my tip through the bloomin� trip
Along o� the women an� drink.
I�m down at the heel o� my service,
An� when I am laid on the shelf,
My very worst friend from beginning to end
By the blood of a mouse was myself!

(Chorus) Ho! don�t you �eed what a girl says,
An� don�t you go for the beer;
But I was an ass when I was at grass,
An� that is why I�m �ere!
