 Some cawing Crows, a hooting Owl,
 A Hawk, a Canary, an old Marsh-Fowl,
 One day all meet together
 To hold a caucus and settle the fate
 Of a certain bird (without a mate),
 A bird of another feather.

 "My friends," said the Owl, with a look most wise,
 "The Eagle is soaring too near the skies,
 In a way that is quite improper;
 Yet the world is praising her, so I'm told,
 And I think her actions have grown so bold
 That some of us ought to stop her."

 "I have heard it said," quoth Hawk, with a sigh,
 "That young lambs died at the glance of her eye,
 And I wholly scorn and despise her.
 This, and more, I am told they say,
 And I think that the only proper way
 Is never to recognize her."

 "I am quite convinced," said Crow, with a caw,
 "That the Eagle minds no moral law,
 She's a most unruly creature."
 "She's an ugly thing," piped Canary Bird;
 "Some call her handsome - it's so absurd - 
 She hasn't a decent feature."

 Then the old Marsh-Hen went hopping about,
 She said she was sure - she hadn't a doubt - 
 Of the truth of each bird's story:
 And she thought it a duty to stop her flight,
 To pull her down from her lofty height,
 And take the gilt from her glory.

 But, lo! from a peak on the mountain grand
 That looks out over the smiling land
 And over the mighty ocean,
 The Eagle is spreading her splendid wings - 
 She rises, rises, and upward swings,
 With a slow, majestic motion.

 Up in the blue of God's own skies,
 With a cry of rapture, away she flies,
 Close to the Great Eternal:
 She sweeps the world with her piercing sight;
 Her soul is filled with the infinite
 And the joy of things supernal.

 Thus rise forever the chosen of God,
 The genius-crowned or the power-shod,
 Over the dust-world sailing;
 And back, like splinters blown by the winds,
 Must fall the missiles of silly minds,
 Useless and unavailing.
