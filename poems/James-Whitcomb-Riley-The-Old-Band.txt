 It's mighty good to git back to the old town, shore,
 Considerin' I've be'n away twenty year and more.
 Sence I moved then to Kansas, of course I see a change,
 A-comin' back, and notice things that's new to me and strange;
 Especially at evening when yer new band-fellers meet,
 In fancy uniforms and all, and play out on the street -
 . . . What's come of old Bill Lindsey and the Saxhorn fellers - say?
 I want to hear the old band play.

 What's come of Eastman, and Nat Snow? And where's War Barnett at?
 And Nate and Bony Meek; Bill Hart; Tom Richa'son and that-
 Air brother of him played the drum as twic't as big as Jim;
 And old Hi Kerns, the carpenter - say, what's become o' him?
 I make no doubt yer new band now's a competenter band,
 And plays their music more by note than what they play by hand,
 And stylisher and grander tunes; but somehow - anyway,
 I want to hear the old band play.

 Sich tunes as "John Brown's Body" and "Sweet Alice," don't you know;
 And "The Camels is A-comin'," and "John Anderson, my Jo";
 And a dozent others of 'em - "Number Nine" and "Number 'Leven"
 Was favo-rites that fairly made a feller dream o' Heaven.
 And when the boys 'u'd saranade, I've laid so still in bed
 I've even heerd the locus'-blossoms droppin' on the shed
 When "Lilly Dale," er "Hazel Dell," had sobbed and died away -
 . . . I want to hear the old band play.

 Yer new band ma'by beats it, but the old band's what I said -
 It allus 'peared to kind o' chord with somepin' in my head;
 And, whilse I'm no musicianer, when my blame' eyes is jes'
 Nigh drownded out, and Mem'ry squares her jaws and sort o' says
 She won't ner never will fergit, I want to jes' turn in
 And take and light right out o' here and git back West ag'in
 And stay there, when I git there, where I never haf to say
 I want to hear the old band play.
