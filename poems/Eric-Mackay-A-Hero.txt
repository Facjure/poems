title: A Hero.

The warrior knows how fitful is the fight, -
 How sad to live, - how sweet perchance to die.
Is Fame his joy? He meets her on the height,
 And when he falls he shouts his battle-cry;
 His eyes are wet; our own will not be dry.
Nor shall we stint his praise, or our delight,
When he survives to serve his Land aright
 And make his fame the watchword of the sky.
In all our hopes his love is with us still;
 He tends our faith, he soothes us when we grieve.
 His acts are just; his word we must believe,
And none shall spurn him, though his blood they spill
To pierce the heart whose pride they cannot kill. -
 Death dies for him whose fame is his reprieve!
