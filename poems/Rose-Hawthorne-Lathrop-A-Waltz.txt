title: A Waltz.

Delicate gayety,
Strains of a violin;
Graceful steps begin - 
Roses at her waist!
Clouds of sparkling light,
Whispers of lovers alone
As the couples drift one by one
In the golden sheen of the ball.
Alone in the happy crowd
Each pair glides past each pair;
Delicate strains of an air;
Rainbow gayety:
Pride of the moment throbs,
Smiles, on the youthful cheek,
Fearing no ill-wind's freak,
Warm in the heart of the waltz; - 
Moving like melody,
Flowing in light and glee,
Young as the May is she,
Strong as the June I am.
