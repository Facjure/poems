title: Pairing Time Anticipated. A Fable.
---

I shall not ask Jean Jaques Rousseau[1]
If birds confabulate or no;
�Tis clear, that they were always able
To hold discourse, at least in fable;
And e�en the child who knows no better
Than to interpret, by the letter,
A story of a cock and bull,
Must have a most uncommon skull.
It chanced then on a winter�s day,
But warm, and bright, and calm as May,
The birds, conceiving a design
To forestall sweet St. Valentine,
In many an orchard, copse, and grove,
Assembled on affairs of love,
And with much twitter and much chatter
Began to agitate the matter.
At length a Bullfinch, who could boast
More years and wisdom than the most,
Entreated, opening wide his beak,
A moment�s liberty to speak;
And, silence publicly enjoin�d,
Deliver�d briefly thus his mind:
My friends! be cautious how ye treat
The subject upon which we meet;
I fear we shall have winter yet.
A Finch, whose tongue knew no control,
With golden wing and satin poll,
A last year�s bird, who ne�er had tried
What marriage means, thus pert replied:
Methinks the gentleman, quoth she,
Opposite in the apple-tree,
By his good will would keep us single
Till yonder heaven and earth shall mingle,
Or (which is likelier to befall)
Till death exterminate us all.
I marry without more ado,
My dear Dick Redcap, what say you?
Dick heard, and tweedling, ogling, bridling,
Turning short round, strutting and sideling,
Attested, glad, his approbation
Of an immediate conjugation.
Their sentiments so well express�d
Influenced mightily the rest,
All pair�d, and each pair built a nest.
But, though the birds were thus in haste,
The leaves came on not quite so fast,
And destiny, that sometimes bears
An aspect stern on man�s affairs,
Not altogether smiled on theirs.
The wind, of late breathed gently forth,
Now shifted east, and east by north;
Bare trees and shrubs but ill, you know,
Could shelter them from rain or snow,
Stepping into their nests, they paddled,
Themselves were chill�d, their eggs were addled;
Soon every father bird and mother
Grew quarrelsome, and peck�d each other,
Parted without the least regret,
Except that they had ever met,
And learn�d in future to be wiser,
Than to neglect a good adviser.
moral.
Misses! the tale that I relate
This lesson seems to carry�
Choose not alone a proper mate,
But proper time to marry.
