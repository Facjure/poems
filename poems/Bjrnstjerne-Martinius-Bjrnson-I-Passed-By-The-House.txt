title: I Passed By The House

(See Note 40)

I passed by the house one summer day,
Morning sunshine upon it lay;
Toward the windows that blood-red burned
Flaming my soul was turned, was turned.
 There spring had found me
 And captive bound me
 To lissome hands and soft lips enthralling,
 To smiles now stained by the teardrops falling.

Till the view from my vision dies,
To it backward I send my eyes;
All that was becomes new and near,
The forgotten grows warm and dear;
 Mem'ries wander,
 While this I ponder,
 And from the springtime all love's sweet dreaming
 Forward and back in my soul is streaming.

Joyous that time and joyous now,
Sorrow that time and .sorrow now.
Sun on meadows bedewed appears,
Soul in mem'ries of smiles and tears.
 When they waking
 Their bounds are breaking,
 When streams their ebbing with sinking power,
 The soul bears poetry's bud and flower.
