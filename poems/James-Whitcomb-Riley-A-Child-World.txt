title: A Child-World

The Child-World - long and long since lost to view - 
A Fairy Paradise! - 
How always fair it was and fresh and new - 
How every affluent hour heaped heart and eyes
With treasures of surprise!

Enchantments tangible: The under-brink
Of dawns that launched the sight
Up seas of gold: The dewdrop on the pink,
With all the green earth in it and blue height
Of heavens infinite:

The liquid, dripping songs of orchard-birds - 
The wee bass of the bees, - 
With lucent deeps of silence afterwards;
The gay, clandestine whisperings of the breeze
And glad leaves of the trees.

O Child-World: After this world - just as when
I found you first sufficed
My soulmost need - if I found you again,
With all my childish dream so realised,
I should not be surprised.
