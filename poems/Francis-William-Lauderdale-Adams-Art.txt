 "Yes, let Art go, if it must be
That with it men must starve - 
 If Music, Painting, Poetry
Spring from the wasted hearth!"

 Yes, let Art go, till once again
Through fearless heads and hands
 The toil of millions and the pain
Be passed from out the lands:

 Till from the few their plunder falls
To those who've toiled and earned
 But misery's hopeless intervals
From those who've robbed and spurned.

 Yes, let Art go, without a fear,
Like autumn flowers we burn,
 For, with her reawakening year,
Be sure she will return! - 

 Return, but greater, nobler yet
Because her laurel crown
 With dew and not with blood is wet,
And as our queen sit down!
