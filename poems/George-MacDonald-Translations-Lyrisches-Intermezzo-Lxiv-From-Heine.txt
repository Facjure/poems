Night lay upon mine eyelids;
 Upon my mouth lay lead;
With rigid brain and bosom,
 I lay among the dead.

How long it was I know not
 That sleep oblivion gave;
I wakened up, and, listening,
 Heard a knocking at my grave.

"Tis time to rise up, Henry!
 The eternal day draws on;
The dead are all arisen--
 The eternal joy's begun."

"My love, I cannot raise me;
 For I have lost my sight;
My eyes with bitter weeping
 They are extinguished quite."

"From thy dear eyelids, Henry,
 I'll kiss the night away;
Thou shalt behold the angels,
 And Heaven's superb display."

"My love, I cannot raise me;
 Still bleeds my bosom gored,
Where thou heart-deep didst stab me
 With a keen-pointed word."

"Soft I will lay it, Henry,
 My hand soft on thy heart;
And that will stop its bleeding
 And soothe at once the smart."

"My love, I cannot raise me--
 My head is bleeding too;
When thou wast stolen from me
 I shot it through and through!"

"I with my tresses, Henry,
 Will stop the fountain red;
Press back again the blood-stream,
 And heal thy wounded head."

She begged so sweetly, dearly,
 I could no more say no;
I tried, I strove to raise me,
 And to my darling go.

Then the wounds again burst open;
 With torrent force outbrake
From head and breast the blood-stream,
 And, lo, I came awake!
