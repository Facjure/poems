title: O Dear Me!
---

 Here are crocuses, white, gold, grey!
'O dear me!' says Marjorie May;
 Flat as a platter the blackberry blows:
'O dear me!' says Madeleine Rose;
 The leaves are fallen, the swallows flown:
'O dear me!' says Humphrey John;
 Snow lies thick where all night it fell:
'O dear me!' says Emmanuel.
