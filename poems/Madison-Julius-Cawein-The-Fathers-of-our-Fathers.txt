Written February 24, 1898, on reading the latest news concerning the battleship Maine, blown up in Havana harbor, February 15th.


I.

 The fathers of our fathers they were men!
What are we who now stand idle while we see our seamen slain?
Who behold our flag dishonored, and still pause!
Are we blind to her duplicity, the treachery of Spain?
To the rights, she scorns, of nations and their laws?
Let us rise, a mighty people, let us wipe away the stain!
Must we wait till she insult us for a cause?
 The fathers of our fathers they were men!


II.

 The fathers of our fathers they were men!
Had they nursed delay as we do? had they sat thus deaf and dumb,
With these cowards compromising year by year?
Never hearing what they should hear, never saying what should come,
While the courteous mask of Spain still hid a sneer!
No! such news had roused their natures like a rolling battle-drum
God of earth! and God of heaven! do we fear?
 The fathers of our fathers they were men!


III.

 The fathers of our fathers they were men!
What are we who are so cautious, never venturing too far!
Shall we, at the cost of honor, still keep peace?
While we see the thousands starving and the struggling Cuban star,
And the outraged form of Freedom on her knees!
Let our long, steel ocean-bloodhounds, adamantine dogs of war,
Sweep the yellow Spanish panther from the seas!
 The fathers of our fathers they were men!
