(AFTER HEINE.)

Thou little village curate,
 Come quick, and do not wait;
We'll sit and talk together,
 So sweetly tete-a-tete.

Oh do not fear the railway
 Because it seems so big--
Dost thou not daily trust thee
 Unto thy little gig.

This house is full of painters,
 And half shut up and black;
But rooms the very snuggest
 Lie hidden at the back.
Come! come! come!
