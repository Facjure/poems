title: The Night Of The Dance

The cold moon hangs to the sky by its horn,
 And centres its gaze on me;
The stars, like eyes in reverie,
Their westering as for a while forborne,
 Quiz downward curiously.

Old Robert draws the backbrand in,
 The green logs steam and spit;
The half-awakened sparrows flit
From the riddled thatch; and owls begin
 To whoo from the gable-slit.

Yes; far and nigh things seem to know
 Sweet scenes are impending here;
That all is prepared; that the hour is near
For welcomes, fellowships, and flow
 Of sally, song, and cheer;

That spigots are pulled and viols strung;
 That soon will arise the sound
Of measures trod to tunes renowned;
That She will return in Love's low tongue
 My vows as we wheel around.
