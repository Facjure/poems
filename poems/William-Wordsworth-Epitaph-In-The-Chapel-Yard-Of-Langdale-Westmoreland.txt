title: Epitaph - In The Chapel - Yard Of Langdale, Westmoreland

 By playful smiles, (alas! too oft
 A sad heart's sunshine, by a soft
 And gentle nature, and a free
 Yet modest hand of charity,
 Through life was Owen Lloyd endeared
 To young and old; and how revered
 Had been that pious spirit, a tide
 Of humble mourners testified,
 When, after pains dispensed to prove
 The measure of God's chastening love,
 Here, brought from far, his corse found rest,
 Fulfillment of his own request;
 Urged less for this Yew's shade, though he
 Planted with such fond hope the tree;
 Less for the love of stream and rock,
 Dear as they were, than that his Flock,
 When they no more their Pastor's voice
 Could hear to guide them in their choice
 Through good and evil, help might have,
 Admonished, from his silent grave,
 Of righteousness, of sins forgiven,
 For peace on earth and bliss in heaven.
