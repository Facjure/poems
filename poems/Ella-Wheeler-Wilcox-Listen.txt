Whoever you are as you read this,
 Whatever your trouble or grief,
I want you to know and to heed this,
 The day draweth near with relief.

No sorrow, no woe, is unending;
 Though heaven seems voiceless and dumb,
Remember your cry is ascending,
 And an answer will certainly come.

Whatever temptation is near you,
 Whose eyes on this simple verse fall,
Remember good angels will hear you,
 And help you, so sure as you call.

Who stunned with despair, I beseech you,
 Whatever your losses, your need,
Believe when these printed words reach you -
 Believe you were born to succeed.
