Wheer �asta be�n saw long and me� liggin� �ere alo�n?
Noorse? thoort nowt o� a noorse: whoy, doctor�s abe�n an� ago�n:
Says that I mo�nt �a naw moor a�le: but I be�nt a fool:
Git ma my a�le, fur I be�nt a-gooin� to bre�k my rule.

II.
Doctors, they knaws nowt, for a says what�s nawways true:
Naw soort o� koind o� use to sa�y the things that a do.
I�ve �ed my point o� a�le ivry noight sin� I be�n �ere,
An� I�ve �ed my quart ivry market-noight for foorty year.

III.
Parson�s a be�n loikewoise, an� a sittin� ere o� my bed.
�The amoighty�s a ta�kin o� you to �iss�n, my friend,� a said,
An� a towd ma my sins, an�s toithe were due, an� I gied it in hond;
I done my duty by un, as I �a done by the lond.

IV.
Larn�d a ma� be�. I reckons I �annot sa mooch to larn.
But a cast oop, thot a did, �boot Bessy Marris�s barn.
Thaw a knaws I hallus vo�ted wi� Squoire an� choorch an sta�te,
An� i� the woost o� toimes I wur niver agin the ra�te.

V.
An� I hallus comed to �s choorch afoor moy Sally wur de�d,
An� �e�rd �um a bummin� awa�y loike a buzzard-clock ower my �e�d,
An� I niver knaw�d whot a mean�d but I thowt a �ad summut to sa�y,
An I thowt a said whot a owt to �a said an� I comed awa�y.

VI.
Bessy Marris�s barn! tha knaws she la�id it to me�.
Mowt �a be�n, mayhap, for she wur a bad un, she�.
�Siver, I kep un, I kep un, my lass, tha mun understond;
I done my duty by un as I �a done boy the lond.

VII.
But Parson a comes an� a go�s, an� a says it easy an� free�
�The amoighty�s a ta�kin o� you to �issen, my friend,� says �e�.
I we�nt sa�y men be loiars, thof summun said it in �a�ste:
But a re�ds wonn sarmin a wee�k, an� I �a stubb�d Thornaby wa�ste.

VIII.
D�ya moind the wa�ste, my lass? naw, naw, tha was not born then;
Theer wur a boggle in it, I often �e�rd �um mysen;
Mo�st loike a butter-bump, for I �e�rd �um about an� about,
But I stubb�d un oop wi� the lot, an� ra�ved an rembled �um out.

IX.
Ke�per�s it wur; fo� they fun �um theer a la�id on �is fa�ce
Down i� the woild �enemies afoor I coom�d to the pla�ce.
No�ks or Thimbleby�to�ner �ed shot un as de�d as a na�il.
No�ks wur �ang�d for it oop at �soize�but git ma my a�le.

X.
Dubbut loo�k at the wa�ste: theer warn�t not fee�d for a cow:
Nowt at all but bracken an� fuzz, an� loo�k at it now�
Warn�t worth nowt a ha�cre, an� now theer�s lots o� fee�d,
Fourscoor yows upon it an� some on it down i� see�d.

XI.
Nobbut a bit on it�s left, an� I me�n�d to �a stubb�d it at fall,
Done it ta-year I me�n�d, an� runn�d plow thruff it an� all,
If godamoighty an� parson �ud nobbut let ma alo�n,
Me�, wi� ha�te hoonderd ha�cre o� Squoire�s, an� lond o� my o�n.

XII.
Do godamoighty knaw what a�s doing a-ta�kin� o� me�?
I be�nt wonn as saws �ere a be�n an� yonder a pe�;
An� Squoire �ull be sa mad an� all�a� dear a� dear!
And I �a managed for Squoire coom Michaelmas thutty year.

XIII.
A mowt �a ta�en owd Jo�nes, as �ant a �a�poth o� sense,
Or a mowt a� ta�en young Robins�a niver mended a fence:
But godamoighty a moost ta�ke me� an� ta�ke ma now
Wi a�f the cows to cauve an� Thornaby ho�lms to plow!

XIV.
Loook �ow quoloty smoiles when they sees ma a passin� by,
Says to thess�n naw doot �what a mon a be� sewer-loy!�
For they knaws what I be�n to Squoire sin fust a coom�d to the �All;
I done moy duty by Squoire an� I done my duty boy all.

XV.
Squoire�s in Lunnon, an� summun I reckons �ull �a to wroite,
For who�s to howd the lond ater me� thot muddles ma quoit;
Sartin-sewer I be�, thot a we�nt niver give it to Jo�nes,
Naw, nor a mo�nt to Robins�a niver rembles the sto�ns.

XVI.
But summun �ull come ater me� mayhap wi� �is kittle o� steam
Huzzin� an� ma�zin� the blessed fe�lds wi� the Divil�s oa�n te�m.
Sin I mun doy I mun doy, thaw loife they says is sweet,
But sin I mun doy I mun doy, for I couldn abe�r to see it.

XVII.
What atta stannin� theer for, an� doesn bring ma the a�le?
Doctor�s a �to�ttler, lass, an a�s hallus i� the owd ta�le;
I we�nt break rules fur Doctor, a knaws naw moor nor a floy;
Git ma my a�le I tell tha, an� if I mun doy I mun doy.
