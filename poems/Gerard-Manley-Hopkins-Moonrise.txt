I Awoke in the Midsummer not to call night, |in the white and the walk of the morning:
The moon, dwindled and thinned to the fringe | of a finger-nail held to the candle,
Or paring of paradisaï¿½cal fruit, | lovely in waning but lustreless,
Stepped from the stool, drew back from the barrow, | of dark Maenefa the mountain;
A cusp still clasped him, a fluke yet fanged him, | en- tangled him, not quit utterly.
This was the prized, the desirable sight, | unsought, pre- sented so easily,
Parted me leaf and leaf, divided me, | eyelid and eyelid of slumber.
