title: Rapture To Laura.

 From earth I seem to wing my flight,
 And sun myself in Heaven's pure light,
 When thy sweet gaze meets mine
 I dream I quaff ethereal dew,
 When my own form I mirrored view
 In those blue eyes divine!

 Blest notes from Paradise afar,
 Or strains from some benignant star
 Enchant my ravished ear:
 My Muse feels then the shepherd's hour
 When silvery tones of magic power
 Escape those lips so dear!

 Young Loves around thee fan their wings
 Behind, the maddened fir-tree springs,
 As when by Orpheus fired:
 The poles whirl round with swifter motion,
 When in the dance, like waves o'er Ocean,
 Thy footsteps float untired!

 Thy look, if it but beam with love,
 Could make the lifeless marble move,
 And hearts in rocks enshrine:
 My visions to reality
 Will turn, if, Laura, in thine eye
 I read that thou art mine!
