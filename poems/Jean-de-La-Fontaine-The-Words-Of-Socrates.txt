[1]

 A house was built by Socrates
 That failed the public taste to please.
 Some blamed the inside; some, the out; and all
 Agreed that the apartments were too small.
 Such rooms for him, the greatest sage of Greece!
 'I ask,' said he, 'no greater bliss
 Than real friends to fill e'en this.'
 And reason had good Socrates
 To think his house too large for these.
 A crowd to be your friends will claim,
 Till some unhandsome test you bring.
 There's nothing plentier than the name;
 There's nothing rarer than the thing.
