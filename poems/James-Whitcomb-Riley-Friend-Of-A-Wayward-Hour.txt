title: Friend Of A Wayward Hour
---

 Friend of a wayward hour, you came
 Like some good ghost, and went the same;
 And I within the haunted place
 Sit smiling on your vanished face,
And talking with - your name.

 But thrice the pressure of your hand -
 First hail - congratulations - and
 Your last "God bless you!" as the train
 That brought you snatched you back again
Into the unknown land.

 "God bless me?" Why, your very prayer
 Was answered ere you asked it there,
 I know - for when you came to lend
 Me your kind hand, and call me friend,
God blessed me unaware.
