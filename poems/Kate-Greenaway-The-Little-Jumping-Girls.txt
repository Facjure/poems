Jump jump jump 
Jump away
From this town into
The next, to-day.

Jump jump jump 
Jump over the moon;
Jump all the morning,
And all the noon.

Jump jump jump 
Jump all night;
Won't our mothers
Be in a fright?

Jump jump jump 
Over the sea;
What wonderful wonders
We shall see.

Jump jump jump 
And leave behind
Everything evil
That we may find.

Jump jump jump 
Jump far away;
And all come home
Some other day.
