And here the precious dust is laid;
Whose purely-temper�d clay was made
So fine that it the guest betray�d.

Else the soul grew so fast within,
It broke the outward shell of sin,
And so was hatch�d a cherubin.

In height, it soar�d to God above;
In depth, it did to knowledge move,
And spread in breadth to general love.

Before, a pious duty shin�d
To parents, courtesy behind;
On either side an equal mind.

Good to the poor, to kindred dear,
To servants kind, to friendship clear,
To nothing but herself severe.

So, though a virgin, yet a bride
To ev�ry grace, she justified
A chaste polygamy, and died.

Learn from hence, reader, what small trust
We owe this world, where virtue must,
Frail as our flesh, crumble to dust.
