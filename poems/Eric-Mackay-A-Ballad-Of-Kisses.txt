I.

There are three kisses that I call to mind,
 And I will sing their secrets as I go.
The first, a kiss too courteous to be kind,
 Was such a kiss as monks and maidens know;
 As sharp as frost, as blameless as the snow.


II.

The second kiss, ah God! I feel it yet,
 And evermore my soul will loathe the same.
The toys and joys of fate I may forget,
 But not the touch of that divided shame:
 It clove my lips; it burnt me like a flame.


III.

The third, the final kiss, is one I use
 Morning and noon and night; and not amiss.
Sorrow be mine if such I do refuse!
 And when I die, be love, enrapt in bliss,
 Re-sanctified in Heaven by such a kiss.
