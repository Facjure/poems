 I. Speak Now for Peace

 Lady of Light, and our best woman, and queen,
 Stand now for peace, (though anger breaks your heart),
 Though naught but smoke and flame and drowning is seen.

 Lady of Light, speak, though you speak alone,
 Though your voice may seem as a dove's in this howling flood,
 It is heard to-night by every senate and throne.

 Though the widening battle of millions and millions of men
 Threatens to-night to sweep the whole of the earth,
 Back of the smoke is the promise of kindness again.


 II. Tolstoi Is Plowing Yet

 Tolstoi is plowing yet. When the smoke-clouds break,
 High in the sky shines a field as wide as the world.
 There he toils for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake.

 Ah, he is taller than clouds of the little earth.
 Only the congress of planets is over him,
 And the arching path where new sweet stars have birth.

 Wearing his peasant dress, his head bent low,
 Tolstoi, that angel of Peace, is plowing yet;
 Forward, across the field, his horses go.
