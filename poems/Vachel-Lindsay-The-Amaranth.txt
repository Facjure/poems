 Ah, in the night, all music haunts me here....
 Is it for naught high Heaven cracks and yawns
 And the tremendous Amaranth descends
 Sweet with the glory of ten thousand dawns?

 Does it not mean my God would have me say: - 
 "Whether you will or no, O city young,
 Heaven will bloom like one great flower for you,
 Flash and loom greatly all your marts among?"

 Friends, I will not cease hoping though you weep.
 Such things I see, and some of them shall come
 Though now our streets are harsh and ashen-gray,
 Though our strong youths are strident now, or dumb.
 Friends, that sweet town, that wonder-town, shall rise.
 Naught can delay it.Though it may not be
 Just as I dream, it comes at last I know
 With streets like channels of an incense-sea.
