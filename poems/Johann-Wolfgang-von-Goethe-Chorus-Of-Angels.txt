Christ is arisen!

Mortal, all hail!
Thou, of Earth's prison

Dreary and frail,
Bursting the veil,

Proudly hast risen!

CHORUS OF WOMEN.

Rich spices and myrrh,

To embalm Him we brought;
His corpse to inter

His true followers sought.
In pure cerements shrin'd,

'Twas placed in the bier
But, alas! we now find

That Christ is not here.

CHORUS OF ANGELS.

Christ is arisen!

Speechless His love.
Who to Earth's prison

Came from above,
Trials to prove.

Now is He risen!

CHORUS OF YOUTHS.

Death's gloomy portal

Now hath He rended,
Living, immortal,

Heavenward ascended;
Freed from His anguish,

Sees He God's throne;
We still must languish,

Earthbound, alone.
Now that He's reft us,

Heart-sad we pine;
Why hast Thou left us,

Master divine?

CHORUS OF ANGELS.


Christ is arisen,

Death hath He slain;

Burst ye your prison,

Rend ye each chain!

Songs of praise lead ye,

Love to show, heed ye,

Hungry ones feed ye,

Preaching, on speed ye,

Coming joys plead ye,
Then is the Master near,
Then is He here!
