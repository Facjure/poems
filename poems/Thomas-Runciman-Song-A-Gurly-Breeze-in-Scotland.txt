title: Song. A Gurly Breeze in Scotland.
---

A gurly breeze swept from the pool
The Autumn peace so blue and cool,
Which all day long had dreamed thereon
Of men and things aforetime gone,
Their vanished joy, their ended dule:
So glooms the sea, so sounds her brool,
As from the East at eve comes on
A gurly breeze.

Sense yields to Fancy 'neath whose rule
This inland scene is quickly full
Of ocean moods wherein I con
As in a picture; quickly gone.
To what sweet use the mind may school
A gurly breeze!
