title: Epilogue.

 Here check we our career:
 Long books I greatly fear.
 I would not quite exhaust my stuff;
 The flower of subjects is enough.
 To me, the time is come, it seems,
 To draw my breath for other themes.
 Love, tyrant of my life, commands
 That other work be on my hands.
 I dare not disobey.
 Once more shall Psyche be my lay.
 I'm call'd by Damon to portray
 Her sorrows and her joys.
 I yield: perhaps, while she employs,
 My muse will catch a richer glow;
 And well if this my labour'd strain
 Shall be the last and only pain
 Her spouse[1] shall cause me here below.
