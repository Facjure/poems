My Bed is like a little Bark,
 The hatch is battened down,
And in the basket cabin dark
 I sail away from Town.

Now, when they lift the lid, a scene
 Of wonder meets my eyes,
Tall waving Feather-Dusters green,
 That seem to touch the skies.

And over all the Ground is spread
 A Rug of Emerald sweet,
Most deep enough to hide my head
 And tickly to my feet.

And here's the Cow, calm-eyed stands she,
 The Genie of the Jug,
Beneath the Feather-Duster Tree,
 And eats the Emerald Rug.
