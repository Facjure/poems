Now cometh October - a nut-brown maid,
Who in robes of crimson and gold arrayed
 Hath taken the king's highway!
On the world she smiles - but to me it seems
Her eyes are misty with mid-summer dreams,
 Or memories of the May.

Opals agleam in the dusk of her hair
Flash their hearts of fire and colours rare
 As she dances gaily by - 
Yet she sighs for each empty swinging nest,
And she tenderly holds against her breast
 A belated butterfly.

The crickets sing no more to the stars - 
The spiders no more put up silver bars
 To entangle silken wings;
But the quail pipes low in the rusted corn,
And here and there - both at night and at morn - 
 A lonely robin still sings.

A spice-laden breeze of the south is blent
With perfumed winds from the Orient
 And they weave o'er her a spell,
For nun-like she goeth now, still and sweet - 
And while mists like incense curl at her feet,
 She lingers her beads to tell.
