[He and his gang stuck up the township of Canowindra for two days in 1859.]

 (Air: �Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.�)


John Gilbert was a bushranger of terrible renown,
For sticking lots of people up and shooting others down.
John Gilbert said unto his pals, �Although they make a bobbery
About our tricks we have never done a tip-top thing in robbery.

�We have all of us a fancy for experiments in pillage,
Yet never have we seized a town, or even sacked a village.�
John Gilbert said unto his mates��Though partners we have been
In all rascality, yet we no festal day have seen.�

John Gilbert said he thought he saw no obstacle to hinder a
Piratical descent upon the town of Canowindra.
So into Canowindra town rode Gilbert and his men,
And all the Canowindra folk subsided there and then.

The Canowindra populace cried, �Here�s a lot of strangers!!!�
But immediately recovered when they found they were bushrangers.
And Johnny Gilbert said to them, �You need not be afraid.
We are only old companions whom bushrangers you have made.�

And Johnny Gilbert said, said he, �We�ll never hurt a hair
Of men who bravely recognise that we are just all there.�
The New South Welshmen said at once, not making any fuss,
That Johnny Gilbert, after all, was �Just but one of us.�

So Johnny Gilbert took the town (including public houses),
And treated all the�cockatoos� and shouted for their spouses.
And Miss O�Flanagan performed in manner quite gintailly
Upon the grand planner for the bushranger O�Meally.

And every stranger passing by they took, and when they got him
They robbed him of his money and occasionally shot him.
And Johnny�s enigmatic feat admits of this solution,
That bushranging in New South Wales is a favoured institution.

So Johnny Gilbert ne�er allows an anxious thought to fetch him,
For well he knows the Government don�t really want to ketch him.
And if such practices should be to New South Welshmen dear,
With not the least demurring word ought we to interfere.
