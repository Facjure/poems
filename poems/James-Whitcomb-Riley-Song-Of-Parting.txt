title: Song Of Parting
---

Say farewell, and let me go;
 Shatter every vow!
All the future can bestow
 Will be welcome now!
And if this fair hand I touch
I have worshipped overmuch,
It was my mistake - and so,
Say farewell, and let me go.

Say farewell, and let me go:
 Murmur no regret,
Stay your tear-drops ere they flow -
 Do not waste them yet!
They might pour as pours the rain,
And not wash away the pain:
I have tried them and I know. -
Say farewell, and let me go.

Say farewell, and let me go:
 Think me not untrue -
True as truth is, even so
 I am true to you!
If the ghost of love may stay
Where my fond heart dies to-day,
I am with you alway - so,
Say farewell, and let me go.
