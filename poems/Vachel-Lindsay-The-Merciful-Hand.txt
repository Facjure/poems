title: The Merciful Hand

Written to Miss Alice L. F. Fitzgerald, Edith Cavell memorial nurse, going to the front.


 Your fine white hand is Heaven's gift
 To cure the wide world, stricken sore,
 Bleeding at the breast and head,
 Tearing at its wounds once more.

 Your white hand is a prophecy,
 A living hope that Christ shall come
 And make the nations merciful,
 Hating the bayonet and drum.

 Each desperate burning brain you soothe,
 Or ghastly broken frame you bind,
 Brings one day nearer our bright goal,
 The love-alliance of mankind.
