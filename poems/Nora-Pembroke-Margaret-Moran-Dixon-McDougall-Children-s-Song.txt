We little children join to praise
The Holy Child of endless days.
The Lord of glory undefiled
Was once like us a little child.

Chorus.--
"Sweetly, sweetly, sweetly singing,
 Let us praise him, praise him, praise him, bringing
 Happy voices, voices, voices ringing
 Like the songs of the angels round the throne."

He hears the ravens when they call,
He sees the little sparrows fall,
He heard the little children sing
Hosanna to the Saviour King.
Sweetly, &amp;c.

O Jesus, we sing to praise thee,
Who said let children come to me;
We gather round the mercy seat,
O let our songs to thee be sweet.
Sweetly, &amp;c.

Jesus, our Master, Lord and King,
Spread over us thy sheltering wing,
Keep us unspotted, let us be
Thy children singing praise to thee.
Sweetly, &amp;c.
