title: A Boy's Trials.

When I was but a little lad
 One thing I could not bear,
It was to stand at mother's knee
 And have her comb my hair.

They didn't keep boys' hair as short
 As it's kept now-a-days,
And mine was always tangled up
 In twenty different ways.

I'd twist my mouth and grit my teeth,
 And say it wasn't fair - 
It was a trial, and no mistake,
 When mother combed my hair.

She'd brush and brush each stubborn curl
 That grew upon my pate,
And with her scissors nip and clip
 To make the edges straight.

Then smooth it down until it shone,
 While I would grin and bear,
And feel a martyr through and through,
 When mother combed my hair.

She'd take my round chin in her hand
 And hold it there the while
She made the parting carefully,
 Then tell me with a smile:

"Don't push your cap down on your curls
 And spoil my work and care;
He is a pretty little lad
 When mother combs his hair."

I'd hurry out and rumple up
 That mop of hair so thick - 
A vandal, I, for she had worked
 So hard to make it slick - 

And wish I were a grown-up man
 So nobody would dare
To put a washrag in my ears,
 Or comb my tangled hair.

Heigho! now that I'm bald and gray,
 Methinks I would be glad
To have her smooth my brow and cheeks,
 And whisper, "Mother's lad!"

A longing for the care-free days
 Doth take me unaware;
To stand, a boy, at mother's knee
 And have her comb my hair.
