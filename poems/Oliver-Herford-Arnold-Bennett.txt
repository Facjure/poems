'Tis very comforting to know
That every other day or so
A Book by Bennett will appear
To charm the Western Hemisphere.
I see him now, with zeal sublime,
Pounding from dawn to dinner-time
Four typewriters, with hands and feet.
When the four novels are complete,
He'll fold, and send ï¿½ grande vitesse
His Quadrumanuscript to press.


P. S.

Just think how much we'd have to read
If Bennett were a centipede
