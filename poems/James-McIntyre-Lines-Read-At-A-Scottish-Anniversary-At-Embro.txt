Scotsmen have wandered far and wide
From Moray Frith to Frith of Clyde,
McDonald from his sea girt isle,
And Campbell from his broad Argyle.

But chiefly here you have come forth
From those counties of the north,
Some oft have trod Dunrobins halls
And gazed upon its stately walls.

Here to night in this array
Is Murray, McKenzie and McKay,
And there doth around us stand
The Munroe, Ross and Sutherland.

Your young men have high honor earned
In all of the professions learned,
Your bonnie lasses sung in song,
And youths are famed for muscle strong.
