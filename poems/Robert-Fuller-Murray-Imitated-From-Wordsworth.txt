He brought a team from Inversnaid
 To play our Third Fifteen,
A man whom none of us had played
 And very few had seen.

He weighed not less than eighteen stone,
 And to a practised eye
He seemed as little fit to run
 As he was fit to fly.

He looked so clumsy and so slow,
 And made so little fuss;
But he got in behind--and oh,
 The difference to us!
