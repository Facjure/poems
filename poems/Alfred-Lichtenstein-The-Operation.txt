In the sunlight doctors tear a woman apart.
Here the open red body gapes.And heavy blood
Flows, dark wine, into a white bowl.One sees
Very clearly the rose-red cyst.Lead gray,
The limp head hangs down.The hollow mouth
Rattles.The sharp yellow chin points upward.
The room shines, cool and friendly.A nurse
Savors quite a bit of sausage in the background.
