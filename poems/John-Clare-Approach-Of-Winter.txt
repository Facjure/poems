title: Approach Of Winter
---

 The Autumn day now fades away,
 The fields are wet and dreary;
 The rude storm takes the flowers of May,
 And Nature seemeth weary;
 The partridge coveys, shunning fate,
 Hide in the bleaching stubble,
 And many a bird, without its mate,
 Mourns o'er its lonely trouble.

 On hawthorns shine the crimson haw,
 Where Spring brought may-day blossoms:
 Decay is Nature's cheerless law--
 Life's Winter in our bosoms.
 The fields are brown and naked all,
 The hedges still are green,
 But storms shall come at Autumn's fall,
 And not a leaf be seen.

 Yet happy love, that warms the heart
 Through darkest storms severe,
 Keeps many a tender flower to start
 When Spring shall re-appear.
 Affection's hope shall roses meet,
 Like those of Summer bloom,
 And joys and flowers shall be as sweet
 In seasons yet to come.
