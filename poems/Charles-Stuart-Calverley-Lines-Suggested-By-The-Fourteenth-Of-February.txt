title: Lines Suggested By The Fourteenth Of February.

 Darkness succeeds to twilight:
 Through lattice and through skylight
The stars no doubt, if one looked out,
 Might be observed to shine:
 And sitting by the embers
 I elevate my members
On a stray chair, and then and there
 Commence a Valentine.

 Yea! by St. Valentinus,
 Emma shall not be minus
What all young ladies, whate'er their grade is,
 Expect to-day no doubt:
 Emma the fair, the stately -
 Whom I beheld so lately,
Smiling beneath the snow-white wreath
 Which told that she was "out."

 Wherefore fly to her, swallow,
 And mention that I'd "follow,"
And "pipe and trill," et cetera, till
 I died, had I but wings:
 Say the North's "true and tender,"
 The South an old offender;
And hint in fact, with your well-known tact,
 All kinds of pretty things.

 Say I grow hourly thinner,
 Simply abhor my dinner -
Tho' I do try and absorb some viand
 Each day, for form's sake merely:
 And ask her, when all's ended,
 And I am found extended,
With vest blood-spotted and cut carotid,
 To think on Her's sincerely.
