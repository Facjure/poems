title: Nationalism And M'Ilwraith! The Queensland Elections Cry, 1888.
---

 Australia listened! Through the brawling game
Of played-out rascals gambling for her gold,
The rotten-hearted traitors who had sold
 For flimsy English gauds her righteous fame - 
 Through the foul hubbub, it did seem, there came
The still small voice of nobler things untold.
But now, but now with wonder manifold
 She hears a voice that calls her by her name!

 Australia listens, as the mother wilt
To hear her first-born cry. "Say, is it death,
 Or life and all life's hope made audible
That thrills my heart and gives my spirit faith?"
 From out the gathering war-hosts leaps forth shrill
The double cry, "Australia, M'Ilwraith!"

 The dawn is breaking northward! Rise, O Sun,
Australian Liberty, and give us light!
And thou who through the dark and doubtful night
 With great clear eyes of patience looking on
 Even to that splendid hour REPUBLICAN,
O know what things are with thee in the fight - 
What hope and trust, what truth, what right, what might
 To never leave this work till it be done!
 Not as these others were, the helpless slaves
Of each diurnal need and cringing debt,
Australia's statesman, have we known thee yet! - 
 The world's great heroes call from a thousand graves:
"Thy land, a nation, cries to thee to be set
 Free as the freedom of her ocean waves!"
