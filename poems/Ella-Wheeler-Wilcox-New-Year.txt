MORTAL:
 'The night is cold, the hour is late, the world is bleak and
drear;
 Who is it knocking at my door?'

THE NEW YEAR:
 'I am Good Cheer.'

MORTAL:
 'Your voice is strange; I know you not; in shadows dark I grope.
 What seek you here?'

THE NEW YEAR:
 'Friend, let me in; my name is Hope.'

MORTAL:
 'And mine is Failure; you but mock the life you seek to bless.
 Pass on.'

THE NEW YEAR:
 'Nay, open wide the door; I am Success.'

MORTAL:
 'But I am ill and spent with pain; too late has come your wealth.
 I cannot use it.'

THE NEW YEAR:
 'Listen, friend; I am Good Health.'

MORTAL:
 'Now, wide I fling my door.Come in, and your fair statements
prove.'

THE NEW YEAR:
 'But you must open, too, your heart, for I am Love.'
