title: Honey Dripping From The Comb

How slight a thing may set one's fancy drifting
 Upon the dead sea of the Past! - A view -
Sometimes an odor - or a rooster lifting
 A far-off "Ooh! ooh-ooh!"

And suddenly we find ourselves astray
 In some wood's-pasture of the Long Ago -
Or idly dream again upon a day
 Of rest we used to know.

I bit an apple but a moment since -
 A wilted apple that the worm had spurned. -
Yet hidden in the taste were happy hints
 Of good old days returned. -

And so my heart, like some enraptured lute,
 Tinkles a tune so tender and complete,
God's blessing must be resting on the fruit -
 So bitter, yet so sweet!
