Good morrow to the golden morning,
Good morrow to the world's delight - 
I've come to bless thy life's beginning,
Since it makes my own so bright!

I have brought no roses, sweetest,
I could find no flowers, dear, - 
It was when all sweets were over
Thou wert born to bless the year.

But I've brought thee jewels, dearest,
In thy bonny locks to shine, - 
And if love shows in their glances,
They have learn'd that look of mine!
