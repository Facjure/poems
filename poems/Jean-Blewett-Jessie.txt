You miss the touch of her dear hand,
 Her laughter gay and sweet,
The dimpled cheek, the sunny smile,
 The patter of her feet.

The loving glances she bestowed,
 The tender tales she told - 
The world, since she has gone away,
 Seems empty, drear and cold.

Dear, oft you prayed that God would give
 Your darling joy and grace,
That pain or loss might never dim
 The brightness of her face.

That her young heart might keep its trust,
 Its purity so white,
Its wealth of sweet unselfishness,
 Her eyes their radiant light,

Her fair, soft face its innocence
 Of every guile and wrong,
And nothing touch to mar the joy
 And gladness of her song.

God heard the prayer; His answer came - 
 Now, cease thy murmuring, cease - 
"Come, little one, come home," He said,
 "Unto the Land of Peace!"

You sheltered her upon your breast,
 The child so quaint and wise,
To-day, where sorrow is unknown,
 She walks in paradise.

Her eyes have learned the mystery,
 Her feet the vale have crost,
But, friend of mine, you'll find again
 The treasure you have lost.

Your arms will surely clasp once more
 The little fair-haired girl
Who waits for you within the gates
 Of jasper and of pearl.
