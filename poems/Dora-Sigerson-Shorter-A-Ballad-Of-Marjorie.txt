title: A Ballad Of Marjorie
---

 �What ails you that you look so pale,
 O fisher of the sea?�
 ��Tis for a mournful tale I own,
 Fair maiden Marjorie.�

 �What is the dreary tale to tell,
 O toiler of the sea?�
 �I cast my net into the waves,
 Sweet maiden Marjorie.

 �I cast my net into the tide,
 Before I made for home;
 Too heavy for my hands to raise,
 I drew it through the foam.�

 �What saw you that you look so pale,
 Sad searcher of the sea?�
 �A dead man�s body from the deep
 My haul had brought to me!�

 �And was he young, and was he fair?�
 �Oh, cruel to behold!
 In his white face the joy of life
 Not yet was grown a-cold.�

 �Oh, pale you are, and full of prayer
 For one who sails the sea.�
 �Because the dead looked up and spoke,
 Poor maiden Marjorie.�

 �What said he, that you seem so sad,
 O fisher of the sea?
 (Alack! I know it was my love,
 Who fain would speak to me!)�

 �He said, �Beware a woman�s mouth-
 A rose that bears a thorn.��
 �Ah, me! these lips shall smile no more
 That gave my lover scorn.�

 �He said, �Beware a woman�s eyes.
 They pierce you with their death.��
 �Then falling tears shall make them blind
 That robbed my dear of breath.�

 �He said, �Beware a woman�s hair-
 A serpent�s coil of gold.��
 �Then will I shear the cruel locks
 That crushed him in their fold.�

 �He said, �Beware a woman�s heart
 As you would shun the reef.��
 �So let it break within my breast,
 And perish of my grief.�

 �He raised his hands; a woman�s name
 Thrice bitterly he cried:
 My net had parted with the strain;
 He vanished in the tide.�

 �A woman�s name!What name but mine,
 O fisher of the sea?�
 �A woman�s name, but not your name,
 Poor maiden Marjorie.�
