---

A chant for a children's pantomime dance, suggested by a picture painted by George Mather Richards.


 I saw a proud, mysterious cat,
 I saw a proud, mysterious cat
 Too proud to catch a mouse or rat - 
 Mew, mew, mew.

 But catnip she would eat, and purr,
 But catnip she would eat, and purr.
 And goldfish she did much prefer - 
 Mew, mew, mew.

 I saw a cat - 'twas but a dream,
 I saw a cat - 'twas but a dream
 Who scorned the slave that brought her cream - 
 Mew, mew, mew.

 Unless the slave were dressed in style,
 Unless the slave were dressed in style
 And knelt before her all the while - 
 Mew, mew, mew.

 Did you ever hear of a thing like that?
 Did you ever hear of a thing like that?
 Did you ever hear of a thing like that?
 Oh, what a proud mysterious cat.
 Oh, what a proud mysterious cat.
 Oh, what a proud mysterious cat.
 Mew... mew... mew.
