	"Awake! awake! for the earliest gleam
	Of golden sunlight shines
	On the rippling waves, that brightly flow
	Beneath the flowering vines.
	Awake! awake! for the low, sweet chant
	Of the wild-birds' morning hymn
	Comes floating by on the fragrant air,
	Through the forest cool and dim;
	Then spread each wing,
	And work, and sing,
	Through the long, bright sunny hours;
	O'er the pleasant earth
	We journey forth,
	For a day among the flowers.

	"Awake! awake! for the summer wind
	Hath bidden the blossoms unclose,
	Hath opened the violet's soft blue eye,
	And wakened the sleeping rose.
	And lightly they wave on their slender stems
	Fragrant, and fresh, and fair,
	Waiting for us, as we singing come
	To gather our honey-dew there.
	Then spread each wing,
	And work, and sing,
	Through the long, bright sunny hours;
	O'er the pleasant earth
	We journey forth,
	For a day among the flowers!"
