In the oldest of our alleys,
 By good bejants tenanted,
Once a man whose name was Wallace--
 William Wallace--reared his head.
Rowdy Bejant in the college
 He was styled:
Never had these halls of knowledge
 Welcomed waster half so wild!

Tassel blue and long and silken
 From his cap did float and flow
(This was cast into the Swilcan
 Two months ago);
 And every gentle air that sported
 With his red gown,
Displayed a suit of clothes, reported
 The most alarming in the town.

Wanderers in that ancient alley
 Through his luminous window saw
Spirits come continually
 From a case well packed with straw,
Just behind the chair where, sitting
 With air serene,
And in a blazer loosely fitting,
 The owner of the bunk was seen.

And all with cards and counters straying
 Was the place littered o'er,
With which sat playing, playing, playing,
 And wrangling evermore,
 A group of fellows, whose chief function
 Was to proclaim,
In voices of surpassing unction,
 Their luck and losses in the game.

But stately things, in robes of learning,
 Discussed one day the bejant's fate:
Ah, let us mourn him unreturning,
 For they resolved to rusticate!
And now the glory he inherits,
 Thus dished and doomed,
Is largely founded on the merits
 Of the Old Tom consumed.

And wanderers, now, within that alley
 Through the half-open shutters see,
Old crones, that talk continually
 In a discordant minor key:
 While, with a kind of nervous shiver,
 Past the front door,
His former set go by for ever,
 But knock--or ring--no more.
