title: All On An April Morning.
---

The teacher was wise and learned, I wis,
 All nonsense she held in scorning,
But you never can tell what the primmest miss
 Will do of a bright spring morning.

What this one did was to spread a snare
 For feet of a youth unheeding,
As March, with a meek and lamb-like air,
 To its very last hour was speeding.

Oh, he was the dullard of his class,
 For how can a youth get learning
With his eyes aye fixed on a pretty lass
 And his heart aye filled with yearning?

"Who finds 'mong the rushes which fringe a pool,"
 She told him, "the first wind blossom,
May wish what he will" - poor April fool,
 With but one wish in his bosom.

Her gray eyes danced - on a wild-goose chase
 He'd sally forth on the morrow,
And, later, she'd laugh in his sombre face,
 And jest at his words of sorrow.

But penitence and a troubled mind
 Were fruits of the night's reflection;
After all, he was simple, and strong, and kind - 
 'Twas wrong to flout his affection.

They met on the hill as she walked to school;
 He said, unheeding her blushes,
"Here's the early flower your April fool
 Found growing among the rushes.

"Take it or leave it as you will" - 
 His voice ringing out so clearly
Awoke in her heart a happy thrill - 
 "You know that I love you dearly."

Day-dreams indulged as she taught the school
 Held lovers kneeling and suing;
"Take it or leave it" - her April fool
 Was masterful in his wooing.

He gave her the flower - she gave him a kiss - 
 His suit she had long been scorning;
But you never can tell what the primmest miss
 Will do of a bright spring morning.
