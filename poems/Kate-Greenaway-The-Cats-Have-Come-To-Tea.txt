title: The Cats Have Come To Tea.

What did she see oh, what did she see,
As she stood leaning against the tree?
Why all the Cats had come to tea.

What a fine turn out from round about,
All the houses had let them out,
And here they were with scamper and shout.

"Mew mew mew!" was all they could say,
And, "We hope we find you well to-day."

Oh, what should she do oh, what should she do?
What a lot of milk they would get through;
For here they were with "Mew mew mew!"

She didn't know oh, she didn't know,
If bread and butter they'd like or no;
They might want little mice, oh! oh! oh!

Dear me oh, dear me,
All the cats had come to tea.
