 Earth's wheels run oiled with blood.Forget we that.
 Let us lie down and dig ourselves in thought.
 Beauty is yours and you have mastery,
 Wisdom is mine, and I have mystery.
 We two will stay behind and keep our troth.
 Let us forego men's minds that are brute's natures,
 Let us not sup the blood which some say nurtures,
 Be we not swift with swiftness of the tigress.
 Let us break ranks from those who trek from progress.
 Miss we the march of this retreating world
 Into old citadels that are not walled.
 Let us lie out and hold the open truth.
 Then when their blood hath clogged the chariot wheels
 We will go up and wash them from deep wells.
 What though we sink from men as pitchers falling
 Many shall raise us up to be their filling
 Even from wells we sunk too deep for war
 And filled by brows that bled where no wounds were.
