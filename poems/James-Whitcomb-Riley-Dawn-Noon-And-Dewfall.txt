I.

Dawn, noon and dewfall!Bluebird and robin
Up and at it airly, and the orchard-blossoms bobbin'!
Peekin' from the winder, half-awake, and wishin'
I could go to sleep agin as well as go a-fishin'!


II.

On the apern o' the dam, legs a-danglin' over,
Drowsy-like with sound o' worter and the smell o' clover:
Fish all out a visitin' - 'cept some dratted minnor!
Yes, and mill shet down at last and hands is gone to dinner.


III.

Trompin' home acrost the fields:Lightnin'-bugs a-blinkin'
In the wheat like sparks o' things feller keeps a-thinkin': - 
Mother waitin' supper, and the childern there to cherr me!
And fiddle on the kitchen-wall a-jist a-eechin' fer me!
