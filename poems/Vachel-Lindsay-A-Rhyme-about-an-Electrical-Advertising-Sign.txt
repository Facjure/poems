title: A Rhyme about an Electrical Advertising Sign
---

 I look on the specious electrical light
 Blatant, mechanical, crawling and white,
 Wickedly red or malignantly green
 Like the beads of a young Senegambian queen.
 Showing, while millions of souls hurry on,
 The virtues of collars, from sunset till dawn,
 By dart or by tumble of whirl within whirl,
 Starting new fads for the shame-weary girl,
 By maggoty motions in sickening line
 Proclaiming a hat or a soup or a wine,
 While there far above the steep cliffs of the street
 The stars sing a message elusive and sweet.

 Now man cannot rest in his pleasure and toil
 His clumsy contraptions of coil upon coil
 Till the thing he invents, in its use and its range,
 Leads on to the marvellous CHANGE BEYOND CHANGE.
 Some day this old Broadway shall climb to the skies,
 As a ribbon of cloud on a soul-wind shall rise.
 And we shall be lifted, rejoicing by night,
 Till we join with the planets who choir their delight.
 The signs in the street and the signs in the skies
 Shall make a new Zodiac, guiding the wise,
 And Broadway make one with that marvellous stair
 That is climbed by the rainbow-clad spirits of prayer.
