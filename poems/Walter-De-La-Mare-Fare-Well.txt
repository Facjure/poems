title: Fare Well

 When I lie where shades of darkness
 Shall no more assail mine eyes,
 Nor the rain make lamentation
 When the wind sighs;
 How will fare the world whose wonder
 Was the very proof of me?
 Memory fades, must the remembered
 Perishing be?

 Oh, when this my dust surrenders
 Hand, foot, lip, to dust again,
 May these loved and loving faces
 Please other men!
 May the rustling harvest hedgerow
 Still the Traveller's Joy entwine,
 And as happy children gather
 Posies once mine.

 Look thy last on all things lovely,
 Every hour. Let no night
 Seal thy sense in deathly slumber
 Till to delight
 Thou have paid thy utmost blessing;
 Since that all things thou wouldst praise
 Beauty took from those who loved them
 In other days.
