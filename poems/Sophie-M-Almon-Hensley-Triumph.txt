title: Triumph.
---

The sky, grown dull through many waiting days,
Flashed into crimson with the sunrise charm,
So all my love, aroused to vague alarm,
Flushed into fire and burned with eager blaze.
I saw thee not as suppliant, with still gaze
Of pleading, but as victor, - and thine arm
Gathered me fast into embraces warm,
And I was taught the light of Love's dear ways.

This day of triumph is no longer thine,
Oh conqueror, in calm exclusive power. - 
As evermore, through storm, and shade, and shine,
Your woe my pain, your joy my ecstasy,
We breathe together, - so this blessed hour
Of self-surrender makes my jubilee!
