title: Poor Man's Grave. (From The Villager's Verse-Book.)
---

 Old Andrews of the hut is dead,
And many a child appears,
Whilst slowly "dust to dust" is read,
Around his grave in tears.

 A good man gone where small and great,
And poor, and high and low,
And Dives, proud in worldly state,
And Lazarus, must go.

 May we among the just be found,
Though short our sojourn here,
Who, when the trump of death shall sound,
May hear it without fear!
