I.

 A woman, fair to look upon,
 Where waters whiten with the moon;
 While down the glimmer of the lawn
 The white moths swoon.

 A mouth of music; eyes of love;
 And hands of blended snow and scent,
 That touch the pearl-pale shadow of
 An instrument.

 And low and sweet that song of sleep
 After the song of love is hushed;
 While all the longing, here, to weep,
 Is held and crushed.

 Then leafy silence, that is musk
 With breath of the magnolia-tree,
 While dwindles, moon-white, through the dusk
 Her drapery.

 Let me remember how a heart,
 Romantic, wrote upon that night!
 My soul still helps me read each part
 Of it aright.

 And like a dead leaf shut between
 A book's dull chapters, stained and dark,
 That page, with immemorial green,
 Of life I mark.


II.

 It is not well for me to hear
 That song's appealing melody:
 The pain of loss comes all too near,
 Through it, to me.

 The loss of her whose love looks through
 The mist death's hand hath hung between:
 Within the shadow of the yew
 Her grave is green.

 Ah, dream that vanished long ago!
 Oh, anguish of remembered tears!
 And shadow of unlifted woe
 Athwart the years!

 That haunt the sad rooms of my days,
 As keepsakes of unperished love,
 Where pale the memory of her face
 Is framed above.

 This olden song, she used to sing,
 Of love and sleep, is now a charm
 To open mystic doors and bring
 Her spirit form.

 In music making visible
 One soul-assertive memory,
 That steals unto my side to tell
 My loss to me.
