title: Woman's Love.
---

A maiden meek, with solemn, steadfast eyes,
 Full of eternal constancy and faith,
And smiling lips, through whose soft portal sighs
 Truth's holy voice, with ev'ry balmy breath;
So journeys she along life's crowded way,
 Keeping her soul's sweet counsel from all sight;
Nor pomp, nor vanity, lead her astray,
 Nor aught that men call dazzling, fair, or bright:
For pity, sometimes, doth she pause, and stay
 Those whom she meeteth mourning, for her heart
 Knows well in suffering how to bear its part.
Patiently lives she through each dreary day,
 Looking with little hope unto the morrow;
 And still she walketh hand in hand with sorrow.
