title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part III. - XXIX - The Commination Service
---

 Shun not this Rite, neglected, yea abhorred,
 By some of unreflecting mind, as calling
 Man to curse man, (thought monstrous and appalling.)
 Go thou and hear the threatenings of the Lord;
 Listening within his Temple see his sword
 Unsheathed in wrath to strike the offender's head,
 Thy own, if sorrow for thy sin be dead,
 Guilt unrepented, pardon unimplored.
 Two aspects bears Truth needful for salvation;
 Who knows not 'that?' yet would this delicate age
 Look only on the Gospel's brighter page:
 Let light and dark duly our thoughts employ;
 So shall the fearful words of Commination
 Yield timely fruit of peace and love and joy.
