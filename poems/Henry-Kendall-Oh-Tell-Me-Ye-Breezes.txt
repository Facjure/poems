title: Oh, Tell Me, Ye Breezes
---

Oh, tell me, ye breezes that spring from the west,
Oh, tell me, ere passing away,
If Leichhardt�s bold spirit has fled to its rest?
Where moulders the traveller�s clay?

Perchance as ye flitted on heedlessly by
The long lost was yielding his breath;
Perchance ye have borne on your wings the last sigh
That �scap�d from the lone one in death.

Tell me, ye breezes, ye�ve traversed the wild,
And passed o�er the desolate spot,
Where reposeth in silence sweet Nature�s own child,
Where slumbers one nearly forgot?

Ye answer me not but are passing away
Ye breezes that spring from the west,
Unhallow�d still moulders the traveller�s clay,
For unknown is the place of his rest.
