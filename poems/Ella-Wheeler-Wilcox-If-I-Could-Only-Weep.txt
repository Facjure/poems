title: If I Could Only Weep
---

 If I could only weep,
I think sweet help with my salt tears would come,
To ease the cruel pain that is so dumb,
 And will not let me sleep.

 Down in my heart, down deep
A poisoned arrow burns.It would fall out
And tears would wash the wound, I have no doubt,
 If I could only weep.

 Maybe my pulse would leap,
And bring one thrill back, of a vanished day,
Instead of throbbing in this dull, dead way,
 If I could only weep.

 O silent Fates who steep
Nectar or gall for us through all the years,
Take what thou wilt, but give me back my tears,
 And let me weep and weep.
