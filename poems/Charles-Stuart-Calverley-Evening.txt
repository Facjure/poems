Kate! if e'er thy light foot lingers
 On the lawn, when up the fells
Steals the Dark, and fairy fingers
 Close unseen the pimpernels:
When, his thighs with sweetness laden,
 From the meadow comes the bee,
And the lover and the maiden
 Stand beneath the trysting tree:-
	
Lingers on, till stars unnumber'd
 Tremble in the breeze-swept tarn,
And the bat that all day slumber'd
 Flits about the lonely barn;
And the shapes that shrink from garish
 Noon are peopling cairn and lea;
And thy sire is almost bearish
 If kept waiting for his tea:-
	
And the screech-owl scares the peasant
 As he skirts some churchyard drear;
And the goblins whisper pleasant
 Tales in Miss Rossetti's ear;
Importuning her in strangest,
 Sweetest tones to buy their fruits:-
O be careful that thou changest,
 On returning home, thy boots.
