SPRING

A sudden softness in the wind;
 A glint of song, a-wing;
A fragrant sound that trails behind,
 And joy in everything.

A sudden flush upon the cheek,
 The teardrop quick to start;
A hope too delicate to speak,
 And heaven within the heart.

SUMMER

A riotous dawn and the sea's great wonder;
 The red, red heart of a rose uncurled;
And beauty tearing her veil asunder,
 In sight of a swooning world.

A call of the soul, and the senses blended;
 The Springtime lost in the glow of the sun,
And two lives rushing, as God intended,
 To meet and mingle as one.

AUTUMN

The world is out in gala dress;
 And yet it is not gay.
Its splendour hides a loneliness
 For something gone away.

(Laughter and music on the air;
 A shower of rice and bloom.
Smiles for the fond departing pair - 
 And then the empty room.)

WINTER

Two trees swayed in the winter wind; and dreamed
The snowflakes falling about them were bees
Singing among the leaves.And they were glad,
Knowing the dream would soon come true.

Beside the hearth an aged couple rocked,
And dozed; and dreamed the friends long passed from sight
Were with them once again.They woke and smiled,
Knowing the dream would soon come true.
