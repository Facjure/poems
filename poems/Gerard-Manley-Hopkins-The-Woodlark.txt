Teevo cheetio cheevio chee:
O where, what can th�t be?
Weedio-weedio: there again!
So tiny a trickle of s�ng-strain;
And all round not to be found
For brier, bough, furrow, or gr�en ground
Before or behind or far or at hand
Either left either right
Anywhere in the s�nlight.
Well, after all! Ah but hark - 
'I am the little woodlark.
. . . . . . .
To-day the sky is two and two
With white strokes and strains of the blue
. . . . . . .
Round a ring, around a ring
And while I sail (must listen) I sing
. . . . . . .
The skylark is my cousin and he
Is known to men more than me
. . . . . . .
 . . . when the cry within
Says Go on then I go on
Till the longing is less and the good gone

But down drop, if it says Stop,
To the all-a-leaf of the tr�etop
And after that off the bough
. . . . . . .
I �m so v�ry, O s� very glad
That I d� th�nk there is not to be had . . .
. . . . . . .
The blue wheat-acre is underneath
And the braided ear breaks out of the sheath,
The ear in milk, lush the sash,
And crush-silk poppies aflash,
The blood-gush blade-gash
Flame-rash rudred
Bud shelling or broad-shed
Tatter-tassel-tangled and dingle-a-dangled
Dandy-hung dainty head.
. . . . . . .
And down ... the furrow dry
Sunspurge and oxeye
And laced-leaved lovely
Foam-tuft fumitory
. . . . . . .
Through the velvety wind V-winged
To the nest's nook I balance and buoy
With a sweet joy of a sweet joy,
Sweet, of a sweet, of a sweet joy
Of a sweet - a sweet - sweet - joy.'
