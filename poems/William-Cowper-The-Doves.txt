Reasoning at every step he treads,
Man yet mistakes his way;
While meaner things, whom instinct leads,
Are rarely known to stray.


One silent eve I wander�d late,
And heard the voice of love;
The turtle thus address�d her mate,
And soothed the listening dove:


Our mutual bond of faith and truth
No time shall disengage,
Those blessings of our early youth
Shall cheer our latest age:


While innocence without disguise,
And constancy sincere,
Shall fill the circles of those eyes,
And mine can read them there;


Those ills, that wait on all below,
Shall ne�er be felt by me,
Or gently felt, and only so,
As being shared with thee.


When lightnings flash among the trees,
Or kites are hovering near,
I fear lest thee alone they seize,
And know no other fear.


�Tis then I feel myself a wife,
And press thy wedded side,
Resolved a union form�d for life
Death never shall divide.


But oh! if, fickle and unchaste
(Forgive a transient thought),
Thou couldst become unkind at last,
And scorn thy present lot;


No need of lightnings from on high,
Or kites with cruel beak;
Denied the endearments of thine eye,
This widow�d heart would break.


Thus sang the sweet sequester�d bird,
Soft as the passing wind;
And I recorded what I heard,
A lesson for mankind.
