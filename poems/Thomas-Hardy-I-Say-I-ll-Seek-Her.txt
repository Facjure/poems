title: I Say I'll Seek Her
---

I say, "I'll seek her side
 Ere hindrance interposes;"
 But eve in midnight closes,
And here I still abide.

When darkness wears I see
 Her sad eyes in a vision;
 They ask, "What indecision
Detains you, Love, from me? -

"The creaking hinge is oiled,
 I have unbarred the backway,
 But you tread not the trackway;
And shall the thing be spoiled?

"Far cockcrows echo shrill,
 The shadows are abating,
 And I am waiting, waiting;
But O, you tarry still!"
