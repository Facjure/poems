 The tidings received in the Northern Metropolis.
 (April, 1865.)


 What mean these peals from every tower,
 And crowds like seas that sway?
 The cannon reply; they speak the heart
 Of the People impassioned, and say - 
 A city in flags for a city in flames,
 Richmond goes Babylon's way - 
 Sing and pray.

 O weary years and woeful wars,
 And armies in the grave;
 But hearts unquelled at last deter
 The helmed dilated Lucifer - 
 Honor to Grant the brave,
 Whose three stars now like Orion's rise
 When wreck is on the wave - 
 Bless his glaive.

 Well that the faith we firmly kept,
 And never our aim forswore
 For the Terrors that trooped from each recess
 When fainting we fought in the Wilderness,
 And Hell made loud hurrah;
 But God is in Heaven, and Grant in the Town,
 And Right through might is Law - 
 God's way adore.
