title: To John Johnston, Esq., On His Presenting Me With An Antique Bust Of Homer.
---

Kinsman beloved, and as a son, by me!
When I behold the fruit of thy regard,
The sculptured form of my old favourite bard,
I reverence feel for him, and love for thee:
Joy too and grief�much joy that there should be,
Wise men and learn�d, who grudge not to reward
With some applause my bold attempt and hard,
Which others scorn; critics by courtesy.
The grief is this, that, sunk in Homer�s mine,
I lose my precious years, now soon to fail,
Handling his gold, which, howsoe�er it shine,
Proves dross when balanced in the Christian scale.
Be wiser thou�like our forefather Donne,
Seek heavenly wealth, and work for God alone.
