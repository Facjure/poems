So you�ve kem �yer agen,
And one answer won�t do?
Well, of all the derned men
That I�ve struck, it is you.
O Sal! �yer�s that derned fool from Simpson�s, cavortin� round �yer in the dew.

Kem in, ef you will.
Thar, quit! Take a cheer.
Not that; you can�t fill
Them theer cushings this year,
For that cheer was my old man�s, Joe Simpson, and they don�t make such men about �yer.

He was tall, was my Jack,
And as strong as a tree.
Thar�s his gun on the rack,
Jest you heft it, and see.
And you come a courtin� his widder! Lord! where can that critter, Sal, be!

You�d fill my Jack�s place?
And a man of your size,
With no baird to his face,
Nor a snap to his eyes,
And nary Sho! thar! I was foolin�, I was, Joe, for sartain, don�t rise.

Sit down. Law! why, sho!
I�m as weak as a gal.
Sal! Don�t you go, Joe,
Or I�ll faint, sure, I shall.
Sit down, anywheer, where you like, Joe, in that cheer, if you choose, Lord! where�s Sal?
