The deserted streets flow in gleaming light
Through my dull head.And hurt me.
I clearly feel that I shall soon slip away - 
Thorny roses of my skin, don't prick like that.
The night grows moldy.The poison light of the lampposts
Has smeared it with green muck.
My heart is like a bag.My blood freezes.
The world is dying.My eyes collapse.
