Oh, lovely Mary Donnelly, my joy, my only best
If fifty girls were round you, I�d hardly see the rest;
Be what it may the time o� day, the place be where it will
Sweet looks o� Mary Donnelly, they bloom before me still.

Her eyes like mountain water that�s flowing on a rock,
How clear they are, how dark they are! they give me many a shock.
Red rowans warm in sunshine and wetted with a shower,
Could ne�er express the charming lip that has me in its power.

Her nose is straight and handsome, her eyebrows lifted up,
Her chin is very neat and pert, and smooth like a china cup,
Her hair�s the brag of Ireland, so weighty and so fine;
It�s rolling down upon her neck, and gathered in a twine.

The dance o� last Whit-Monday night exceeded all before,
No pretty girl from miles about was missing from the floor;
But Mary kept the belt of love, and O but she was gay!
She danced a jig, she sung a song, that took my heart away.

When she stood up for dancing, her steps were so complete,
The music nearly killed itself to her feet;
The fiddler mourned his blindness, he heard her so much praised,
But blessed his luck not to be deaf when once her voice she raised.

And evermore I�m whistling or lilting what you sung,
Your smile is always in my heart, your name beside my tongue;
But you�ve as many sweethearts as you�d count on both your hands,
And for myself there�s not a thumb or little finger stands.

Oh, you�re the flower o� womankind in country or in town;
The higher I exalt you, the lower I�m cast down.
If some great lord should come this way, and see your beauty bright.
And you to be his lady, I�d own it was but right.

Oh, might we live together in a lofty palace hall,
Where joyful music rises, and where scarlet curtains fall!
Oh, might we live together in a cottage mean and small,
With sods or grass the only roof, and mud the only wall!

O lovely Mary Donnelly, your beauty�s my distress,
It�s far too beauteous to be mine, but I�ll never wish it less.
The proudest place would fit your face, and I am poor and low
But blessings be about you, dear, wherever you may go.
