title: The Life Of Earth

The life of earth, how full of pain,
 Which greets us on our day of birth,
Nor leaves us while we yet retain
The life of earth.

There is a shadow on our mirth,
 Our sun is blotted out with rain,
And all our joys are little worth.

Yet oh, when life begins to wane,
 And we must sail the doubtful firth,
How wild the longing to regain
The life of earth!
