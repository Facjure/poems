We Do�set, though we mid be hwomely,
Be�nt asheamed to own our pleace;
An� we�ve zome women not uncomely;
Nor asheamed to show their feace;
We�ve a mead or two wo�th mowen,
We�ve a ox or two wo�th showen,
In the village,
At the tillage.
Come along an� you shall vind
That Do�set men don�t sheame their kind.
Friend an� wife,
Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers,
Happy, happy, be their life!
Vor Do�set dear,
Then gi�e woone cheer;
D�ye hear? woone cheer!
If you in Do�set be a roamen,
An� ha� business on a farm,
Then woont ye zee your eale a foamen!
Or your cider down to warm?
Woont yo have brown bread a-put ye,
An� some vinney cheese a-cut ye?
Butter?�Rolls o�t!
Cream?�why bowls o�t!
Woont ye have, in short, your vill,
A-gi�ed wi� a right good will? Friend an� wife,
Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers,
Happy, happy, be their life!
Vor Do�set dear,
Then gi�e woone cheer;
D�ye hear? woone cheer!

An woon�t yo have vor ev�ry shillen,
Shillen�s wo�th at any shop.
Though Do�set chaps be up to zellen
An� can meake a tidy swop?
Use �em well, they�ll use you better;
In good turns they woont be debtor,
An� so comely,
An� so hwomely,
Be the maidens, if your son
Took woone o�m, then you�d cry �Well done!�
Friend an� wife,
Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers,
Happy, happy, be their life!
Vor Do�set dear,
Then gi�e woone cheer;
D�ye hear? woone cheer!
