 (The Little Saucepan)

 Four collier lads from Ebbw Vale
 Took shelter from a shower of hail,
 And there beneath a spreading tree
 Attuned their mouths to harmony.

 With smiling joy on every face
 Two warbled tenor, two sang bass,
 And while the leaves above them hissed with
 Rough hail, they started "Aberystwyth."

 Old Parry's hymn, triumphant, rich,
 They changed through with even pitch,
 Till at the end of their grand noise
 I called:"Give us the 'Sospan' boys!"

 Who knows a tune so soft, so strong,
 So pitiful as that "Saucepan" song
 For exiled hope, despaired desire
 Of lost souls for their cottage fire?

 Then low at first with gathering sound
 Rose their four voices, smooth and round,
 Till back went Time:once more I stood
 With Fusiliers in Mametz Wood.

 Fierce burned the sun, yet cheeks were pale,
 For ice hail they had leaden hail;
 In that fine forest, green and big,
 There stayed unbroken not one twig.

 They sang, they swore, they plunged in haste,
 Stumbling and shouting through the waste;
 The little "Saucepan" flamed on high,
 Emblem of hope and ease gone by.

 Rough pit-boys from the coaly South,
 They sang, even in the cannon's mouth;
 Like Sunday's chapel, Monday's inn,
 The death-trap sounded with their din.

 ***

 The storm blows over, Sun comes out,
 The choir breaks up with jest and shout,
 With what relief I watch them part, 
 Another note would break my heart!
