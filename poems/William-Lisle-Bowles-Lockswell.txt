 Pure fount, that, welling from this wooded hill,
 Dost wander forth, as into life's wide vale,
 Thou to the traveller dost tell no tale
 Of other years; a lone, unnoticed rill,
 In thy forsaken track, unheard of men,
 Melting thy own sweet music through the glen.
Time was when other sounds and songs arose;
 When o'er the pensive scene, at evening's close,
 The distant bell was heard; or the full chant,
 At morn, came sounding high and jubilant;
 Or, stealing on the wildered pilgrim's way,
 The moonlight "Miserere" died away,
 Like all things earthly.
 Stranger, mark the spot;
 No echoes of the chiding world intrude.
 The structure rose and vanished; solitude
 Possessed the woods again; old Time forgot,
 Passing to wider spoil, its place and name.
 Since then, even as the clouds of yesterday,
 Seven hundred years have well-nigh passed away;
 No wreck remains of all its early pride;
 Like its own orisons, its fame has died.
But this pure fount, through rolling years the same,
 Yet lifts its small still voice, like penitence,
 Or lowly prayer. Then pass admonished hence,
 Happy, thrice happy, if, through good or ill,
 Christian, thy heart respond to this forsaken rill.
