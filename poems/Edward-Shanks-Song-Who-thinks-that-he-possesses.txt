title: Song: Who thinks that he possesses.
---

Who thinks that he possesses
His mistress with his kisses
Knows neither love nor her.
Nor beauty is not his
Who seeks it in a kiss:
If you would seek for this
O seek it otherwhere!

Love is a flame, a spirit
Beyond all earthly merit
And all we dream of here;
Strive as you may but still
Love is intangible,
No servant to your will
But sovereign otherwhere.
