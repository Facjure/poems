title: Sonnet To A Young Lady On Her Birth-Day.

Deem not, sweet rose, that bloom�st� midst many a thorn,
Thy friend, though to a cloister�s shade consign�d,
Can e�er forget the charms he left behind,
Or pass unheeded this auspicious morn!
In happier days to brighter prospects born,
O tell thy thoughtless sex, the virtuous mind,
Like thee, content in every state may find,
And look on Folly�s pageantry with scorn.
To steer with nicest art betwixt th� extreme
Of idle mirth, and affectation coy;
To blend good sense with elegance and ease;
To bid Affliction�s eye no longer stream;
Is thine; best gift, the unfailing source of joy,
The guide to pleasures which can never cease!
