title: A Suggestion, To C. A. D.

Let the wild red-rose bloom.Though not to thee
 So delicately perfect as the white
 And unwed lily drooping in the light,
Though she has known the kisses of the bee
 And tells her amorous tale to passers-by
In perfumed whispers and with untaught grace,
Still let the red-rose bloom in her own place;
 She could not be the lily should she try.

Why to the wondrous nightingale cry hush
 Or bid her cease her wild heart-breaking lay,
 And tune her voice to imitate the way
The whip-poor-will makes music, or the thrush?
 All airs of sorrow to one theme belong,
And passion is not copyrighted yet.
Each heart writes its own music.Why not let
 The nightingale unchided sing her song?
