title: Epilogue.  Under the Blessing of Your Psyche Wings
---

 Though I have found you like a snow-drop pale,
 On sunny days have found you weak and still,
 Though I have often held your girlish head
 Drooped on my shoulder, faint from little ill: - 

 Under the blessing of your Psyche-wings
 I hide to-night like one small broken bird,
 So soothed I half-forget the world gone mad: - 
 And all the winds of war are now unheard.

 My heaven-doubting pennons feel your hands
 With touch most delicate so circling round,
 That for an hour I dream that God is good.
 And in your shadow, Mercy's ways abound.

 I thought myself the guard of your frail state,
 And yet I come to-night a helpless guest,
 Hiding beneath your giant Psyche-wings,
 Against the pallor of your wondrous breast.
