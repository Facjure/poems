A white bird is the big sky.
Under it a cowering city stares.
The houses are half-dead old people.
A gaunt carriage-horse gapes grumpily.
Winds, skinny dogs, run weakly.
Their skins squeel on sharp corners.
In a street a crazed man groans: You, oh, you - 
If only I could find you...
A crowd around him is surprised and grins derisively.
Three little people play blind man's bluff - 
A gentle tear-stained god lays the grey powdery hands
Of afternoon over everything.
