 I.

Came a spicy smell of showers
 On the purple wings of night,
And a pearl-encrusted crescent
 On the lake looked still and white,
While a sound of distant singing
 From the vales rose sad and light.


 II.

Dripped the musk of sodden roses
 From their million heavy sprays,
And the nightingales were sobbing
 Of the roses amorous praise
Where the raven down of even
 Caught the moonlight's bleaching rays.


 III.

And the turrets of the palace,
 From its belt of ancient trees,
On the mountain rose romantic
 White as foam from troubled seas;
And the murmur of an ocean
 Smote the chords of ev'ry breeze.


 IV.

Where the moon shone on the terrace
 And its fountain's lisping foam;
Where the bronzen urns of flowers
 Breathed faint perfume thro' the gloam,
By the alabaster Venus
 'Neath the quiet stars we'd roam.


 V.

And we stopped beside the statue
 Of the marble Venus there
Deeply pedestaled 'mid roses,
 Who their crimson hearts laid bare,
Breathing out their lives in fragrance
 At her naked feet and fair.


 VI.

And we marked the purple dingles
 Where the lazy vapors lolled,
Like thin, fleecy ribs of moonlight
 Touched with amethyst and gold;
And we marked the wild deer glimmer
 Like dim specters where they strolled....


 VII.

But from out those treach'rous roses
 Crept a serpent and it stung,
Poisoned him who'd tuned my heart-strings
 Till for him alone they sung,
Froze the nerves of hands that only
 From its chords a note had wrung.


 VIII.

Now the nightingales in anguish
 To cold, ashen roses moan;
Now a sound of desolate wailing
 In the darkened palace lone
From a harp ï¿½olian quavers
 Broken on an empty throne.
