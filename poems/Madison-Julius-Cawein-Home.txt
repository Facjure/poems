 Among the fields the camomile
 Seems blown steam in the lightning's glare.
 Unusual odors drench the air.
 Night speaks above; the angry smile
 Of storm within her stare.

 The way for me to-night? To-night,
 Is through the wood whose branches fill
 The road with dripping rain-drops. Till,
 Between the boughs, a star-like light 
 Our home upon the hill.

 The path for me to take? It goes
 Around a trailer-tangled rock,
 'Mid puckered pink and hollyhock,
 Unto a latch-gate's unkempt rose,
 And door whereat I knock.

 Bright on the old-time flower-place
 The lamp streams through the foggy pane.
 The door is opened to the rain;
 And in the door, her happy face,
 And eager hands again.
