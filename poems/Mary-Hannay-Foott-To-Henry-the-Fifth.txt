My youth was passing, Sire, whilst you among
The cradle-wrappings slept; my morning-song
Sung o�er your pillow. Winds of heaven have thrown
Us both, since then, on heights apart and lone.
Heights! For misfortune drear, our destined land,
So thunder-scarred, a-nigh to heaven must stand!
The north and south are nearer than our ways
Are near to one another; and Fate lays
The purple round you, and has not withheld
Our France�s sceptre-dazzlements of eld.
I, crowned with silver hairs, say, praising you,
�Well done!� That man is to his manhood true
Who bravely, at his own behest, will do
High deeds of self -undoing; will forego
All, all, save immemorial Honour; though
She seem to earthlier eyes a phantom, more
Will follow her (as erst in Elsinore
One faithful heart obeyed the beckoning ghost),
Nor stoop to buy a kingdom at her cost.
That you are aught save honest, none may say;
The Lily must be white, all white, for aye.
A Bourbon can but reign as Capet�s heir,
Or waive his kingship. History is aware
Of wrecks enough, of changing battles� din,
Of those who grandly lose, or basely win!
Better with honour, Prince, the throne to quit.
Than, where St. Louis sat, dishonoured sit!

Melbourne Argus, 1873.
