 I

 The arts are old, old as the stones
 From which man carved the sphinx austere.
 Deep are the days the old arts bring:
 Ten thousand years of yesteryear.


 II

 She is madonna in an art
 As wild and young as her sweet eyes:
 A frail dew flower from this hot lamp
 That is today's divine surprise.

 Despite raw lights and gloating mobs
 She is not seared: a picture still:
 Rare silk the fine director's hand
 May weave for magic if he will.

 When ancient films have crumbled like
 Papyrus rolls of Egypt's day,
 Let the dust speak: "Her pride was high,
 All but the artist hid away:

 "Kin to the myriad artist clan
 Since time began, whose work is dear."
 The deep new ages come with her,
 Tomorrow's years of yesteryear.
