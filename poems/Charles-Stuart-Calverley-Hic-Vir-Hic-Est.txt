Often, when o'er tree and turret,
 Eve a dying radiance flings,
By that ancient pile I linger
 Known familiarly as "King's."
And the ghosts of days departed
 Rise, and in my burning breast
All the undergraduate wakens,
 And my spirit is at rest.

What, but a revolting fiction,
 Seems the actual result
Of the Census's enquiries
 Made upon the 15th ult.?
Still my soul is in its boyhood;
 Nor of year or changes recks.
Though my scalp is almost hairless,
 And my figure grows convex.

Backward moves the kindly dial;
 And I'm numbered once again
With those noblest of their species
 Called emphatically 'Men':
Loaf, as I have loafed aforetime,
 Through the streets, with tranquil mind,
And a long-backed fancy-mongrel
 Trailing casually behind:

Past the Senate-house I saunter,
 Whistling with an easy grace;
Past the cabbage-stalks that carpet
 Still the beefy market-place;
Poising evermore the eye-glass
 In the light sarcastic eye,
Lest, by chance, some breezy nursemaid
 Pass, without a tribute, by.

Once, an unassuming Freshman,
 Through these wilds I wandered on,
Seeing in each house a College,
 Under every cap a Don:
Each perambulating infant
 Had a magic in its squall,
For my eager eye detected
 Senior Wranglers in them all.

By degrees my education
 Grew, and I became as others;
Learned to court delirium tremens
 By the aid of Bacon Brothers;
Bought me tiny boots of Mortlock,
 And colossal prints of Roe;
And ignored the proposition
 That both time and money go.

Learned to work the wary dogcart
 Artfully through King's Parade;
Dress, and steer a boat, and sport with
 Amaryllis in the shade:
Struck, at Brown's, the dashing hazard;
 Or (more curious sport than that)
Dropped, at Callaby's, the terrier
 Down upon the prisoned rat.

I have stood serene on Fenner's
 Ground, indifferent to blisters,
While the Buttress of the period
 Bowled me his peculiar twisters:
Sung 'We won't go home till morning';
 Striven to part my backhair straight;
Drunk (not lavishly) of Miller's
 Old dry wines at 78:-

When within my veins the blood ran,
 And the curls were on my brow,
I did, oh ye undergraduates,
 Much as ye are doing now.
Wherefore bless ye, O beloved ones:-
 Now unto mine inn must I,
Your 'poor moralist,' {51a} betake me,
 In my 'solitary fly.'
