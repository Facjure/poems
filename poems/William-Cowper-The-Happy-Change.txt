How blest thy creature is, O God,
When, with a single eye,
He views the lustre of thy word,
The dayspring from on high!


Through all the storms that veil the skies,
And frown on earthly things,
The Sun of Righteousness he eyes,
With healing on his wings.


Struck by that light, the human heart,
A barren soil no more,
Sends the sweet smell of grace abroad,
Where serpents lurk�d before.[1]


The soul a dreary province once
Of Satan�s dark domain,
Feels a new empire form�d within,
And owns a heavenly reign.


The glorious orb, whose golden beams
The fruitful year control,
Since first, obedient to thy word,
He started from the goal;


Has cheer�d the nations with the joys
His orient rays impart;
But, Jesus, �tis thy light alone
Can shine upon the heart.
