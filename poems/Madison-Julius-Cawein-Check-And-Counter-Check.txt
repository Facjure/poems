1

Vent all your coward's wrath
 Upon me so! - 
Yes, I have crossed your path
 And will not go!


2

Storm at me hate, and name
 Me all that's vile,
"Lust," "filth," "disease," and "shame,"
 I only smile.


3

Me brute rage can not hurt,
 It only flings
In your own eyes blind dirt
 That bites and stings.


4

Rave at your like such whine,
 Your fellow-men,
This wrath! - great God! and mine! - 
 What is it then?


5

No words! no oaths! such hate
 As devils smile
When raw success cries "wait!"
 And "afterwhile!"


6

A woman I and ill,
 A courtesan
You wearied of, would kill,
 And you - a man!


7

You, you - unnamable!
 A thing there's not,
Too base to burn in Hell,
 Too vile to rot.
