 Only a little scrap of blue
 Preserved with loving care,
 But earth has not a brilliant hue
 To me more bright and fair.

 Strong drink, like a raging demon,
 Laid on my heart his hand,
 When my darling joined with others
 The Loyal Legion * band.

 But mystic angels called away
 My loved and precious child,
 And o'er life's dark and stormy way
 Swept waves of anguish wild.


 This badge of the Loyal Legion
 We placed upon her breast,
 As she lay in her little coffin
 Taking her last sweet rest.

 To wear that badge as a token
 She earnestly did crave,
 So we laid it on her bosom
 To wear it in the grave.

 Where sorrow would never reach her
 Nor harsh words smite her ear;
 Nor her eyes in death dimmed slumber
 Would ever shed a tear.

 "What means this badge?" said her father,
 Whom we had tried to save;
 Who said, when we told her story,
 "Don't put it in the grave."

 We took the badge from her bosom
 And laid it on a chair;
 And men by drink deluded
 Knelt by that badge in prayer.

 And vowed in that hour of sorrow
 From drink they would abstain;
 And this little badge became the wedge
 Which broke their galling chain.

 And lifted the gloomy shadows
 That overspread my life,
 And flooding my home with gladness,
 Made me a happy wife.

 And this is why this scrap of blue
 Is precious in my sight;
 It changed my sad and gloomy home
 From darkness into light.
