In our dainty little kitchen,
Where my aproned wife is queen
Over all the tin-pan people,
In a realm exceeding clean,
Oft I like to loiter, watching
While she mixes things for tea;
And she tasks me, slyly smiling,
�Now just guess what this will be!�

Hidden in a big blue apron,
Her dimpled arms laid bare,
And the love-smiles coyly mingling
With a housewife�s frown of care
See her beat a golden batter,
Pausing but to ask of me,
As she adds a bit of butter,
�Now just guess what this will be!�

Then I bravely do my duty,
Guess it, �pudding,� �cake� or �pie,�
�Dumplings,� �waffles,� �bread� or �muffins;�
But no matter what I try,
This provoking witch just answers:
�Never mind, just wait and see!
But I think you should be able,
Dear, to guess what this will be.�

Little fraud! she never tells me
Until �tis baked and browned
And I think I know the reason
For her secrecy profound
She herself with all her fine airs
And her books on cookery,
Could not answer, should I ask her,
�Dearest, what will that mess be?�
