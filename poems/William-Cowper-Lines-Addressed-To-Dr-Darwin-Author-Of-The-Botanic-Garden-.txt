Two Poets[1] (poets, by report,
Not oft so well agree),
Sweet harmonist of Flora�s court!
Conspire to honour thee.


They best can judge a poet�s worth,
Who oft themselves have known
The pangs of a poetic birth
By labours of their own.


We therefore pleased, extol thy song,
Though various, yet complete,
Rich in embellishment as strong,
And learned as �tis sweet.


No envy mingles with our praise,
Though, could our hearts repine
At any poet�s happier lays,
They would�they must at thine.


But we, in mutual bondage knit
Of friendship�s closest tie,
Can gaze on even Darwin�s wit
With an unjaundiced eye;


And deem the Bard, whoe�er he be,
And howsoever known,
Who would not twine a wreath for thee,
Unworthy of his own.
