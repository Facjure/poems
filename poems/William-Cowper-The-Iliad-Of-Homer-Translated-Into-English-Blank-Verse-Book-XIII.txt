 Argument Of The Thirteenth Book.


Neptune engages on the part of the Grecians. The battle proceeds. Deiphobus advances to combat, but is repulsed by Meriones, who losing his spear, repairs to his tent for another. Teucer slays Imbrius, and Hector Amphimachus. Neptune, under the similitude of Thoas, exhorts Idomeneus. Idomeneus having armed himself in his tent, and going forth to battle, meets Meriones. After discourse held with each other, Idomeneus accommodates Meriones with a spear, and they proceed to battle. Idomeneus slays Othryoneus, and Asius. Deiphobus assails Idomeneus, but, his spear glancing over him, kills Hypsenor. Idomeneus slays Alcatho�s, son-in-law of Anchises. Deiphobus and Idomeneus respectively summon their friends to their assistance, and a contest ensues for the body of Alcatho�s.



 [1]When Jove to Hector and his host had given
 Such entrance to the fleet, to all the woes
 And toils of unremitting battle there
 He them abandon'd, and his glorious eyes
 Averting, on the land look'd down remote
 Of the horse-breeding Thracians, of the bold
 Close-fighting Mysian race, and where abide
 On milk sustain'd, and blest with length of days,
 The Hippemolgi,[2] justest of mankind.
 No longer now on Troy his eyes he turn'd,
 For expectation none within his breast
 Survived, that God or Goddess would the Greeks
 Approach with succor, or the Trojans more.
 Nor Neptune, sovereign of the boundless Deep,
 Look'd forth in vain; he on the summit sat
 Of Samothracia forest-crown'd, the stir
 Admiring thence and tempest of the field;
 For thence appear'd all Ida, thence the towers
 Of lofty Ilium, and the fleet of Greece.
 There sitting from the deeps uprisen, he mourn'd
 The vanquished Grecians, and resentment fierce
 Conceived and wrath against all-ruling Jove.
 Arising sudden, down the rugged steep
 With rapid strides he came; the mountains huge
 And forests under the immortal feet
 Trembled of Ocean's Sovereign as he strode.
 Three strides he made, the fourth convey'd him home
 To �g�. At the bottom of the abyss,
 There stands magnificent his golden fane,
 A dazzling, incorruptible abode.
 Arrived, he to his chariot join'd his steeds
 Swift, brazen-hoof'd, and maned with wavy gold;
 Himself attiring next in gold, he seized
 His golden scourge, and to his seat sublime
 Ascending, o'er the billows drove; the whales
 Leaving their caverns, gambol'd on all sides
 Around him, not unconscious of their King;
 He swept the surge that tinged not as he pass'd
 His axle, and the sea parted for joy.
 His bounding coursers to the Grecian fleet
 Convey'd him swift. There is a spacious cave
 Deep in the bottom of the flood, the rocks
 Of Imbrus rude and Tenedos between;
 There Neptune, Shaker of the Shores, his steeds
 Station'd secure; he loosed them from the yoke,
 Gave them ambrosial food, and bound their feet
 With golden tethers not to be untied
 Or broken, that unwandering they might wait
 Their Lord's return, then sought the Grecian host.
 The Trojans, tempest-like or like a flame,
 Now, following Priame�an Hector, all
 Came furious on and shouting to the skies.
 Their hope was to possess the fleet, and leave
 Not an Achaian of the host unslain.
 But earth-encircler Neptune from the gulf
 Emerging, in the form and with the voice
 Loud-toned of Calchas, roused the Argive ranks
 To battle--and his exhortation first
 To either Ajax turn'd, themselves prepared.
 Ye heroes Ajax! your accustomed force
 Exert, oh! think not of disastrous flight,
 And ye shall save the people. Nought I fear
 Fatal elsewhere, although Troy's haughty sons
 Have pass'd the barrier with so fierce a throng
 Tumultuous; for the Grecians brazen-greaved
 Will check them there. Here only I expect
 And with much dread some dire event forebode,
 Where Hector, terrible as fire, and loud
 Vaunting his glorious origin from Jove,
 Leads on the Trojans. Oh that from on high
 Some God would form the purpose in your hearts
 To stand yourselves firmly, and to exhort
 The rest to stand! so should ye chase him hence
 All ardent as he is, and even although
 Olympian Jove himself his rage inspire.
 So Neptune spake, compasser of the earth,
 And, with his sceptre smiting both, their hearts
 Fill'd with fresh fortitude; their limbs the touch
 Made agile, wing'd their feet and nerved their arms.
 Then, swift as stoops a falcon from the point
 Of some rude rock sublime, when he would chase
 A fowl of other wing along the meads,
 So started Neptune thence, and disappear'd.
 Him, as he went, swift O�liades
 First recognized, and, instant, thus his speech
 To Ajax, son of Telamon, address'd.
 Since, Ajax, some inhabitant of heaven
 Exhorts us, in the prophet's form to fight
 (For prophet none or augur we have seen;
 This was not Calchas; as he went I mark'd
 His steps and knew him; Gods are known with ease)
 I feel my spirit in my bosom fired
 Afresh for battle; lightness in my limbs,
 In hands and feet a glow unfelt before.
 To whom the son of Telamon replied.
 I also with invigorated hands
 More firmly grasp my spear; my courage mounts,
 A buoyant animation in my feet
 Bears me along, and I am all on fire
 To cope with Priam's furious son, alone.
 Thus they, with martial transport to their souls
 Imparted by the God, conferr'd elate.
 Meantime the King of Ocean roused the Greeks,
 Who in the rear, beside their gallant barks
 Some respite sought. They, spent with arduous toil,
 Felt not alone their weary limbs unapt
 To battle, but their hearts with grief oppress'd,
 Seeing the numerous multitude of Troy
 Within the mighty barrier; sad they view'd
 That sight, and bathed their cheeks with many a tear,
 Despairing of escape. But Ocean's Lord
 Entering among them, soon the spirit stirr'd
 Of every valiant phalanx to the fight.
 Teucer and Le�tus, and famed in arms
 Peneleus, Thoas and Deipyrus,
 Meriones, and his compeer renown'd,
 Antilochus; all these in accents wing'd
 With fierce alacrity the God address'd.
 Oh shame, ye Grecians! vigorous as ye are
 And in life's prime, to your exertions most
 I trusted for the safety of our ships.
 If ye renounce the labors of the field,
 Then hath the day arisen of our defeat
 And final ruin by the powers of Troy.
 Oh! I behold a prodigy, a sight
 Tremendous, deem'd impossible by me,
 The Trojans at our ships! the dastard race
 Fled once like fleetest hinds the destined prey
 Of lynxes, leopards, wolves; feeble and slight
 And of a nature indisposed to war
 They rove uncertain; so the Trojans erst
 Stood not, nor to Achaian prowess dared
 The hindrance of a moment's strife oppose.
 But now, Troy left afar, even at our ships
 They give us battle, through our leader's fault
 And through the people's negligence, who fill'd
 With fierce displeasure against him, prefer
 Death at their ships, to war in their defence.
 But if the son of Atreus, our supreme,
 If Agamemnon, have indeed transgress'd
 Past all excuse, dishonoring the swift
 Achilles, ye at least the fight decline
 Blame-worthy, and with no sufficient plea.
 But heal we speedily the breach; brave minds
 Easily coalesce. It is not well
 That thus your fury slumbers, for the host
 Hath none illustrious as yourselves in arms.
 I can excuse the timid if he shrink,
 But am incensed at you. My friends, beware!
 Your tardiness will prove ere long the cause
 Of some worse evil. Let the dread of shame
 Affect your hearts; oh tremble at the thought
 Of infamy! Fierce conflict hath arisen;
 Loud shouting Hector combats at the ships
 Nobly, hath forced the gates and burst the bar.
 With such encouragement those Grecian chiefs
 The King of Ocean roused. Then, circled soon
 By many a phalanx either Ajax stood,
 Whose order Mars himself arriving there
 Had praised, or Pallas, patroness of arms.
 For there the flower of all expected firm
 Bold Hector and his host; spear crowded spear,
 Shield, helmet, man, press'd helmet, man and shield;[3]
 The hairy crests of their resplendent casques
 Kiss'd close at every nod, so wedged they stood;
 No spear was seen but in the manly grasp
 It quiver'd, and their every wish was war.
 The powers of Ilium gave the first assault
 Embattled close; them Hector led himself[4]
 Right on, impetuous as a rolling rock
 Destructive; torn by torrent waters off
 From its old lodgment on the mountain's brow,
 It bounds, it shoots away; the crashing wood
 Falls under it; impediment or check
 None stays its fury, till the level found,
 There, settling by degrees, it rolls no more;
 So after many a threat that he would pass
 Easily through the Grecian camp and fleet
 And slay to the sea-brink, when Hector once
 Had fallen on those firm ranks, standing, he bore
 Vehement on them; but by many a spear
 Urged and bright falchion, soon, reeling, retired,
 And call'd vociferous on the host of Troy.
 Trojans, and Lycians, and close-fighting sons
 Of Dardanus, oh stand! not long the Greeks
 Will me confront, although embodied close
 In solid phalanx; doubt it not; my spear
 Shall chase and scatter them, if Jove, in truth,
 High-thundering mate of Juno, bid me on.
 So saying he roused the courage of them all
 Foremost of whom advanced, of Priam's race
 Deiphobus, ambitious of renown.
 Tripping he came with shorten'd steps,[5] his feet
 Sheltering behind his buckler; but at him
 Aiming, Meriones his splendid lance
 Dismiss'd, nor err'd; his bull-hide targe he struck
 But ineffectual; where the hollow wood
 Receives the inserted brass, the quivering beam
 Snapp'd; then, Deiphobus his shield afar
 Advanced before him, trembling at a spear
 Hurl'd by Meriones. He, moved alike
 With indignation for the victory lost
 And for his broken spear, into his band
 At first retired, but soon set forth again
 In prowess through the Achaian camp, to fetch
 Its fellow-spear within his tent reserved.
 The rest all fought, and dread the shouts arose
 On all sides. Telamonian Teucer, first,
 Slew valiant Imbrius, son of Mentor, rich
 In herds of sprightly steeds. He ere the Greeks
 Arrived at Ilium, in Ped�us dwelt,
 And Priam's spurious daughter had espoused
 Medesicasta. But the barks well-oar'd
 Of Greece arriving, he return'd to Troy,
 Where he excell'd the noblest, and abode
 With Priam, loved and honor'd as his own.
 Him Teucer pierced beneath his ear, and pluck'd
 His weapon home; he fell as falls an ash
 Which on some mountain visible afar,
 Hewn from its bottom by the woodman's axe,
 With all its tender foliage meets the ground
 So Imbrius fell; loud rang his armor bright
 With ornamental brass, and Teucer flew
 To seize his arms, whom hasting to the spoil
 Hector with his resplendent spear assail'd;
 He, marking opposite its rapid flight,
 Declined it narrowly and it pierced the breast,
 As he advanced to battle, of the son
 Of Cteatus of the Actorian race,
 Amphimachus; he, sounding, smote the plain,
 And all his batter'd armor rang aloud.
 Then Hector swift approaching, would have torn
 The well-forged helmet from the brows away
 Of brave Amphimachus; but Ajax hurl'd
 Right forth at Hector hasting to the spoil
 His radiant spear; no wound the spear impress'd,
 For he was arm'd complete in burnish'd brass
 Terrific; but the solid boss it pierced
 Of Hector's shield, and with enormous force
 So shock'd him, that retiring he resign'd
 Both bodies,[6] which the Grecians dragg'd away.
 Stichius and Menestheus, leaders both
 Of the Athenians, to the host of Greece
 Bore off Amphimachus, and, fierce in arms
 The Ajaces, Imbrius. As two lions bear
 Through thick entanglement of boughs and brakes
 A goat snatch'd newly from the peasants' cogs,
 Upholding high their prey above the ground,
 So either Ajax terrible in fight,
 Upholding Imbrius high, his brazen arms
 Tore off, and O�liades his head
 From his smooth neck dissevering in revenge
 For slain Amphimachus, through all the host
 Sent it with swift rotation like a globe,
 Till in the dust at Hector's feet it fell.
 Then anger fill'd the heart of Ocean's King,
 His grandson[7] slain in battle; forth he pass'd
 Through the Achaian camp and fleet, the Greeks
 Rousing, and meditating wo to Troy.
 It chanced that brave Idomeneus return'd
 That moment from a Cretan at the knee
 Wounded, and newly borne into his tent;
 His friends had borne him off, and when the Chief
 Had given him into skilful hands, he sought
 The field again, still coveting renown.
 Him therefore, meeting him on his return,
 Neptune bespake, but with the borrow'd voice
 Of Thoas, offspring of Andr�mon, King
 In Pleuro and in lofty Calydon,
 And honor'd by the �tolians as a God.
 Oh counsellor of Crete! our threats denounced
 Against the towers of Troy, where are they now?
 To whom the leader of the Cretans, thus,
 Idomeneus. For aught that I perceive
 Thoas! no Grecian is this day in fault!
 For we are all intelligent in arms,
 None yields by fear oppress'd, none lull'd by sloth
 From battle shrinks; but such the pleasure seems
 Of Jove himself, that we should perish here
 Inglorious, from our country far remote
 But, Thoas! (for thine heart was ever firm
 In battle, and thyself art wont to rouse
 Whom thou observ'st remiss) now also fight
 As erst, and urge each leader of the host.
 Him answered, then, the Sovereign of the Deep.
 Return that Grecian never from the shores
 Of Troy, Idomeneus! but may the dogs
 Feast on him, who shall this day intermit
 Through wilful negligence his force in fight!
 But haste, take arms and come; we must exert
 All diligence, that, being only two,
 We yet may yield some service. Union much
 Emboldens even the weakest, and our might
 Hath oft been proved on warriors of renown.
 So Neptune spake, and, turning, sought again
 The toilsome field. Ere long, Idomeneus
 Arriving in his spacious tent, put on
 His radiant armor, and, two spears in hand,
 Set forth like lightning which Saturnian Jove
 From bright Olympus shakes into the air,
 A sign to mortal men, dazzling all eyes;
 So beam'd the Hero's armor as he ran.
 But him not yet far distant from his tent
 Meriones, his fellow-warrior met,
 For he had left the fight, seeking a spear,
 When thus the brave Idomeneus began.
 Swift son of Molus! chosen companion dear!
 Wherefore, Meriones, hast thou the field
 Abandon'd? Art thou wounded? Bring'st thou home
 Some pointed mischief in thy flesh infixt?
 Or comest thou sent to me, who of myself
 The still tent covet not, but feats of arms?
 To whom Meriones discreet replied,
 Chief leader of the Cretans, brazen-mail'd
 Idomeneus! if yet there be a spear
 Left in thy tent, I seek one; for I broke
 The spear, even now, with which erewhile I fought,
 Smiting the shield of fierce Deiphobus.
 Then answer thus the Cretan Chief return'd,
 Valiant Idomeneus. If spears thou need,
 Within my tent, leaning against the wall,
 Stand twenty spears and one, forged all in Troy,
 Which from the slain I took; for distant fight
 Me suits not; therefore in my tent have I
 Both spears and bossy shields, with brazen casques
 And corselets bright that smile against the sun.
 Him answer'd, then, Meriones discreet.
 I also, at my tent and in my ship
 Have many Trojan spoils, but they are hence
 Far distant. I not less myself than thou
 Am ever mindful of a warrior's part,
 And when the din of glorious arms is heard,
 Fight in the van. If other Greeks my deeds
 Know not, at least I judge them known to thee.
 To whom the leader of the host of Crete
 Idomeneus. I know thy valor well,
 Why speakest thus to me? Choose we this day
 An ambush forth of all the bravest Greeks,
 (For in the ambush is distinguish'd best
 The courage; there the timorous and the bold
 Plainly appear; the dastard changes hue
 And shifts from place to place, nor can he calm
 The fears that shake his trembling limbs, but sits
 Low-crouching on his hams, while in his breast
 Quick palpitates his death-foreboding heart,
 And his teeth chatter; but the valiant man
 His posture shifts not; no excessive fears
 Feels he, but seated once in ambush, deems
 Time tedious till the bloody fight begin;)
 Even there, thy courage should no blame incur.[8]
 For should'st thou, toiling in the fight, by spear
 Or falchion bleed, not on thy neck behind
 Would fall the weapon, or thy back annoy,
 But it would meet thy bowels or thy chest
 While thou didst rush into the clamorous van.
 But haste--we may not longer loiter here
 As children prating, lest some sharp rebuke
 Reward us. Enter quick, and from within
 My tent provide thee with a noble spear.
 Then, swift as Mars, Meriones produced
 A brazen spear of those within the tent
 Reserved, and kindling with heroic fire
 Follow'd Idomeneus. As gory Mars
 By Terror follow'd, his own dauntless son
 Who quells the boldest heart, to battle moves;
 From Thrace against the Ephyri they arm,
 Or hardy Phlegyans, and by both invoked,
 Hear and grant victory to which they please;
 Such, bright in arms Meriones, and such
 Idomeneus advanced, when foremost thus
 Meriones his fellow-chief bespake.
 Son of Deucalion! where inclinest thou most
 To enter into battle? On the right
 Of all the host? or through the central ranks?
 Or on the left? for nowhere I account
 The Greeks so destitute of force as there.
 Then answer thus Idomeneus return'd
 Chief of the Cretans. Others stand to guard
 The middle fleet; there either Ajax wars,
 And Teucer, noblest archer of the Greeks,
 Nor less in stationary fight approved.
 Bent as he is on battle, they will task
 And urge to proof sufficiently the force
 Of Priame�an Hector; burn his rage
 How fierce soever, he shall find it hard,
 With all his thirst of victory, to quell
 Their firm resistance, and to fire the fleet,
 Let not Saturnian Jove cast down from heaven
 Himself a flaming brand into the ships.
 High towering Telamonian Ajax yields
 To no mere mortal by the common gift
 Sustain'd of Ceres, and whose flesh the spear
 Can penetrate, or rocky fragment bruise;
 In standing fight Ajax would not retire
 Even before that breaker of the ranks
 Achilles, although far less swift than he.
 But turn we to the left, that we may learn
 At once, if glorious death, or life be ours.
 Then, rapid as the God of war, his course
 Meriones toward the left began,
 As he enjoin'd. Soon as the Trojans saw
 Idomeneus advancing like a flame,
 And his compeer Meriones in arms
 All-radiant clad, encouraging aloud
 From rank to rank each other, on they came
 To the assault combined. Then soon arose
 Sharp contest on the left of all the fleet.
 As when shrill winds blow vehement, what time
 Dust deepest spreads the ways, by warring blasts
 Upborne a sable cloud stands in the air,
 Such was the sudden conflict; equal rage
 To stain with gore the lance ruled every breast.
 Horrent with quivering spears the fatal field
 Frown'd on all sides; the brazen flashes dread
 Of numerous helmets, corselets furbish'd bright,
 And shields refulgent meeting, dull'd the eye,
 And turn'd it dark away. Stranger indeed
 Were he to fear, who could that strife have view'd
 With heart elate, or spirit unperturb'd.
 Two mighty sons of Saturn adverse parts
 Took in that contest, purposing alike
 To many a valiant Chief sorrow and pain.
 Jove, for the honor of Achilles, gave
 Success to Hector and the host of Troy,
 Not for complete destruction of the Greeks
 At Ilium, but that glory might redound
 To Thetis thence, and to her dauntless son.
 On the other side, the King of Ocean risen
 Secretly from the hoary Deep, the host
 Of Greece encouraged, whom he grieved to see
 Vanquish'd by Trojans, and with anger fierce
 Against the Thunderer burn'd on their behalf.
 Alike from one great origin divine
 Sprang they, but Jove was elder, and surpass'd
 In various knowledge; therefore when he roused
 Their courage, Neptune traversed still the ranks
 Clandestine, and in human form disguised.
 Thus, these Immortal Two, straining the cord
 Indissoluble of all-wasting war,
 Alternate measured with it either host,
 And loosed the joints of many a warrior bold.
 Then, loud exhorting (though himself with age
 Half grey) the Achaians, into battle sprang
 Idomeneus, and scatter'd, first, the foe,
 Slaying Othryoneus, who, by the lure
 Of martial glory drawn, had left of late
 Cabesus. He Priam's fair daughter woo'd
 Cassandra, but no nuptial gift vouchsafed
 To offer, save a sounding promise proud
 To chase, himself, however resolute
 The Grecian host, and to deliver Troy.
 To him assenting, Priam, ancient King,
 Assured to him his wish, and in the faith
 Of that assurance confident, he fought.
 But brave Idomeneus his splendid lance
 Well-aim'd dismissing, struck the haughty Chief.
 Pacing elate the field; his brazen mail
 Endured not; through his bowels pierced, with clang
 Of all his arms he fell, and thus with joy
 Immense exulting, spake Idomeneus.
 I give thee praise, Othryoneus! beyond
 All mortal men, if truly thou perform
 Thy whole big promise to the Dardan king,
 Who promised thee his daughter. Now, behold,
 We also promise: doubt not the effect.
 We give into thy arms the most admired
 Of Agamemnon's daughters, whom ourselves
 Will hither bring from Argos, if thy force
 With ours uniting, thou wilt rase the walls
 Of populous Troy. Come--follow me; that here
 Among the ships we may adjust the terms
 Of marriage, for we take not scanty dower.
 So saying, the Hero dragg'd him by his heel
 Through all the furious fight. His death to avenge
 Asius on foot before his steeds advanced,
 For them, where'er he moved, his charioteer
 Kept breathing ever on his neck behind.
 With fierce desire the heart of Asius burn'd
 To smite Idomeneus, who with his lance
 Him reaching first, pierced him beneath the chin
 Into his throat, and urged the weapon through.
 He fell, as some green poplar falls, or oak,
 Or lofty pine, by naval artists hewn
 With new-edged axes on the mountain's side.
 So, his teeth grinding, and the bloody dust
 Clenching, before his chariot and his steeds
 Extended, Asius lay. His charioteer
 (All recollection lost) sat panic-stunn'd,
 Nor dared for safety turn his steeds to flight.
 Him bold Antilochus right through the waist
 Transpierced; his mail sufficed not, but the spear
 Implanted in his midmost bowels stood.
 Down from his seat magnificent he fell
 Panting, and young Antilochus the steeds
 Drove captive thence into the host of Greece.
 Then came Deiphobus by sorrow urged
 For Asius, and, small interval between,
 Hurl'd at Idomeneus his glittering lance;
 But he, foreseeing its approach, the point
 Eluded, cover'd whole by his round shield
 Of hides and brass by double belt sustain'd,
 And it flew over him, but on his targe
 Glancing, elicited a tinkling sound.
 Yet left it not in vain his vigorous grasp,
 But pierced the liver of Hypsenor, son
 Of Hippasus; he fell incontinent,
 And measureless exulting in his fall
 Deiphobus with mighty voice exclaim'd.
 Not unavenged lies Asius; though he seek
 Hell's iron portals, yet shall he rejoice,
 For I have given him a conductor home.
 So he, whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard!
 But of them all to anger most he roused
 Antilochus, who yet his breathless friend[9]
 Left not, but hasting, fenced him with his shield,
 And brave Alastor with Mecisteus son
 Of Echius, bore him to the hollow ships
 Deep-groaning both, for of their band was he.
 Nor yet Idomeneus his warlike rage
 Remitted aught, but persevering strove
 Either to plunge some Trojan in the shades,
 Or fall himself, guarding the fleet of Greece.
 Then slew he brave Alcatho�s the son
 Of �syeta, and the son-in-law
 Of old Anchises, who to him had given
 The eldest-born of all his daughters fair,
 Hippodamia; dearly loved was she
 By both her parents in her virgin state,[10]
 For that in beauty she surpass'd, in works
 Ingenious, and in faculties of mind
 All her co�vals; wherefore she was deem'd
 Well worthy of the noblest prince of Troy.
 Him in that moment, Neptune by the arm
 Quell'd of Idomeneus, his radiant eyes
 Dimming, and fettering his proportion'd limbs.
 All power of flight or to elude the stroke
 Forsook him, and while motionless he stood
 As stands a pillar tall or towering oak,
 The hero of the Cretans with a spear
 Transfix'd his middle chest. He split the mail
 Erewhile his bosom's faithful guard; shrill rang
 The shiver'd brass; sounding he fell; the beam
 Implanted in his palpitating heart
 Shook to its topmost point, but, its force spent,
 At last, quiescent, stood. Then loud exclaim'd
 Idomeneus, exulting in his fall.
 What thinks Deiphobus? seems it to thee
 Vain boaster, that, three warriors slain for one,
 We yield thee just amends? else, stand thyself
 Against me; learn the valor of a Chief
 The progeny of Jove; Jove first begat
 Crete's guardian, Minos, from which Minos sprang
 Deucalion, and from famed Deucalion, I;
 I, sovereign of the numerous race of Crete's
 Extensive isle, and whom my galleys brought
 To these your shores at last, that I might prove
 Thy curse, thy father's, and a curse to Troy.
 He spake; Deiphobus uncertain stood
 Whether, retreating, to engage the help
 Of some heroic Trojan, or himself
 To make the dread experiment alone.
 At length, as his discreeter course, he chose
 To seek �neas; him he found afar
 Station'd, remotest of the host of Troy,
 For he resented evermore his worth
 By Priam[11] recompensed with cold neglect.
 Approaching him, in accents wing'd he said.
 �neas! Trojan Chief! If e'er thou lov'dst
 Thy sister's husband, duty calls thee now
 To prove it. Haste--defend with me the dead
 Alcatho�s, guardian of thy tender years,
 Slain by Idomeneus the spear-renown'd.
 So saying, he roused his spirit, and on fire
 To combat with the Cretan, forth he sprang.
 But fear seized not Idomeneus as fear
 May seize a nursling boy; resolved he stood
 As in the mountains, conscious of his force,
 The wild boar waits a coming multitude
 Of boisterous hunters to his lone retreat;
 Arching his bristly spine he stands, his eyes
 Beam fire, and whetting his bright tusks, he burns
 To drive, not dogs alone, but men to flight;
 So stood the royal Cretan, and fled not,
 Expecting brave �neas; yet his friends
 He summon'd, on Ascalaphus his eyes
 Fastening, on Aphareus, Deipyrus,
 Meriones, and Antilochus, all bold
 In battle, and in accents wing'd exclaim'd.
 Haste ye, my friends! to aid me, for I stand
 Alone, nor undismay'd the coming wait
 Of swift �neas, nor less brave than swift,
 And who possesses fresh his flower of youth,
 Man's prime advantage; were we match'd in years
 As in our spirits, either he should earn
 At once the meed of deathless fame, or I.
 He said; they all unanimous approach'd,
 Sloping their shields, and stood. On the other side
 His aids �neas call'd, with eyes toward
 Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, turn'd,
 His fellow-warriors bold; them follow'd all
 Their people as the pastured flock the ram
 To water, by the shepherd seen with joy;
 Such joy �neas felt, seeing, so soon,
 That numerous host attendant at his call.
 Then, for Alcatho�s, into contest close
 Arm'd with long spears they rush'd; on every breast
 Dread rang the brazen corselet, each his foe
 Assailing opposite; but two, the rest
 Surpassing far, terrible both as Mars,
 �neas and Idomeneus, alike
 Panted to pierce each other with the spear.
 �neas, first, cast at Idomeneus,
 But, warn'd, he shunn'd the weapon, and it pass'd.
 Quivering in the soil �neas' lance
 Stood, hurl'd in vain, though by a forceful arm.
 Not so the Cretan; at his waist he pierced
 Oenoma�s, his hollow corselet clave,
 And in his midmost bowels drench'd the spear;
 Down fell the Chief, and dying, clench'd the dust.
 Instant, his massy spear the King of Crete
 Pluck'd from the dead, but of his radiant arms
 Despoil'd him not, by numerous weapons urged;
 For now, time-worn, he could no longer make
 Brisk sally, spring to follow his own spear,
 Or shun another, or by swift retreat
 Vanish from battle, but the evil day
 Warded in stationary fight alone.
 At him retiring, therefore, step by step
 Deiphobus, who had with bitterest hate
 Long time pursued him, hurl'd his splendid lance,
 But yet again erroneous, for he pierced
 Ascalaphus instead, offspring of Mars;
 Right through his shoulder flew the spear; he fell
 Incontinent, and dying, clench'd the dust.
 But tidings none the brazen-throated Mars
 Tempestuous yet received, that his own son
 In bloody fight had fallen, for on the heights
 Olympian over-arch'd with clouds of gold
 He sat, where sat the other Powers divine,
 Prisoners together of the will of Jove.
 Meantime, for slain Ascalaphus arose
 Conflict severe; Deiphobus his casque
 Resplendent seized, but swift as fiery Mars
 Assailing him, Meriones his arm
 Pierced with a spear, and from his idle hand
 Fallen, the casque sonorous struck the ground.
 Again, as darts the vulture on his prey,
 Meriones assailing him, the lance
 Pluck'd from his arm, and to his band retired.
 Then, casting his fraternal arms around
 Deiphobus, him young Polites led
 From the hoarse battle to his rapid steeds
 And his bright chariot in the distant rear,
 Which bore him back to Troy, languid and loud-
 Groaning, and bleeding from his recent wound.
 Still raged the war, and infinite arose
 The clamor. Aphareus, Caletor's son,
 Turning to face �neas, in his throat
 Instant the hero's pointed lance received.
 With head reclined, and bearing to the ground
 Buckler and helmet with him, in dark shades
 Of soul-divorcing death involved, he fell.
 Antilochus, observing Tho�n turn'd
 To flight, that moment pierced him; from his back
 He ripp'd the vein which through the trunk its course
 Winds upward to the neck; that vein he ripp'd
 All forth; supine he fell, and with both hands
 Extended to his fellow-warriors, died.
 Forth sprang Antilochus to strip his arms,
 But watch'd, meantime, the Trojans, who in crowds
 Encircling him, his splendid buckler broad
 Smote oft, but none with ruthless point prevail'd
 Even to inscribe the skin of Nestor's son,
 Whom Neptune, shaker of the shores, amid
 Innumerable darts kept still secure.
 Yet never from his foes he shrank, but faced
 From side to side, nor idle slept his spear,
 But with rotation ceaseless turn'd and turn'd
 To every part, now levell'd at a foe
 Far-distant, at a foe, now, near at hand.
 Nor he, thus occupied, unseen escaped
 By Asius' offspring Adamas, who close
 Advancing, struck the centre of his shield.
 But Neptune azure-hair'd so dear a life
 Denied to Adamas, and render'd vain
 The weapon; part within his disk remain'd
 Like a seer'd stake, and part fell at his feet.
 Then Adamas, for his own life alarm'd,
 Retired, but as he went, Meriones
 Him reaching with his lance, the shame between
 And navel pierced him, where the stroke of Mars
 Proves painful most to miserable man.
 There enter'd deep the weapon; down he fell,
 And in the dust lay panting as an ox
 Among the mountains pants by peasants held
 In twisted bands, and dragg'd perforce along;
 So panted dying Adamas, but soon
 Ceased, for Meriones, approaching, pluck'd
 The weapon forth, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 Helenus, with his heavy Thracian blade
 Smiting the temples of Deipyrus,
 Dash'd off his helmet; from his brows remote
 It fell, and wandering roll'd, till at his feet
 Some warrior found it, and secured; meantime
 The sightless shades of death him wrapp'd around.
 Grief at that spectacle the bosom fill'd
 Of valiant Menelaus; high he shook
 His radiant spear, and threatening him, advanced
 On royal Helenus, who ready stood
 With his bow bent. They met; impatient, one,
 To give his pointed lance its rapid course,
 And one, to start his arrow from the nerve.
 The arrow of the son of Priam struck
 Atrides' hollow corselet, but the reed
 Glanced wide. As vetches or as swarthy beans
 Leap from the van and fly athwart the floor,
 By sharp winds driven, and by the winnower's force,
 So from the corselet of the glorious Greek
 Wide-wandering flew the bitter shaft away.
 But Menelaus the left-hand transpierced
 Of Helenus, and with the lance's point
 Fasten'd it to his bow; shunning a stroke
 More fatal, Helenus into his band
 Retired, his arm dependent at his side,
 And trailing, as he went, the ashen beam;
 There, bold Agenor from his hand the lance
 Drew forth, then folded it with softest wool
 Around, sling-wool, and borrow'd from the sling
 Which his attendant into battle bore.
 Then sprang Pisander on the glorious Chief
 The son of Atreus, but his evil fate
 Beckon'd him to his death in conflict fierce,
 Oh Menelaus, mighty Chief! with thee.
 And now they met, small interval between.
 Atrides hurl'd his weapon, and it err'd.
 Pisander with his spear struck full the shield
 Of glorious Menelaus, but his force
 Resisted by the stubborn buckler broad
 Fail'd to transpierce it, and the weapon fell
 Snapp'd at the neck. Yet, when he struck, the heart
 Rebounded of Pisander, full of hope.
 But Menelaus, drawing his bright blade,
 Sprang on him, while Pisander from behind
 His buckler drew a brazen battle-axe
 By its long haft of polish'd olive-wood,
 And both Chiefs struck together. He the crest
 That crown'd the shaggy casque of Atreus' son
 Hew'd from its base, but Menelaus him
 In his swift onset smote full on the front
 Above his nose; sounded the shatter'd bone,
 And his eyes both fell bloody at his feet.
 Convolved with pain he lay; then, on his breast
 Atrides setting fast his heel, tore off
 His armor, and exulting thus began.
 So shall ye leave at length the Grecian fleet,
 Traitors, and never satisfied with war!
 Nor want ye other guilt, dogs and profane!
 But me have injured also, and defied
 The hot displeasure of high-thundering Jove
 The hospitable, who shall waste in time,
 And level with the dust your lofty Troy.
 I wrong'd not you, yet bore ye far away
 My youthful bride who welcomed you, and stole
 My treasures also, and ye now are bent
 To burn Achaia's gallant fleet with fire
 And slay her heroes; but your furious thirst
 Of battle shall hereafter meet a check.
 Oh, Father Jove! Thee wisest we account
 In heaven or earth, yet from thyself proceed
 All these calamities, who favor show'st
 To this flagitious race the Trojans, strong
 In wickedness alone, and whose delight
 In war and bloodshed never can be cloy'd.
 All pleasures breed satiety, sweet sleep,
 Soft dalliance, music, and the graceful dance,
 Though sought with keener appetite by most
 Than bloody war; but Troy still covets blood.
 So spake the royal Chief, and to his friends
 Pisander's gory spoils consigning, flew
 To mingle in the foremost fight again.
 Him, next, Harpalion, offspring of the King
 Pyl�menes assail'd; to Troy he came
 Following his sire, but never thence return'd.
 He, from small distance, smote the central boss
 Of Menelaus' buckler with his lance,
 But wanting power to pierce it, with an eye
 Of cautious circumspection, lest perchance
 Some spear should reach him, to his band retired.
 But him retiring with a brazen shaft
 Meriones pursued; swift flew the dart
 To his right buttock, slipp'd beneath the bone,
 His bladder grazed, and started through before.
 There ended his retreat; sudden he sank
 And like a worm lay on the ground, his life
 Exhaling in his fellow-warrior's arms,
 And with his sable blood soaking the plain.
 Around him flock'd his Paphlagonians bold,
 And in his chariot placed drove him to Troy,
 With whom his father went, mourning with tears
 A son, whose death he never saw avenged.
 Him slain with indignation Paris view'd,
 For he, with numerous Paphlagonians more
 His guest had been; he, therefore, in the thirst
 Of vengeance, sent a brazen arrow forth.
 There was a certain Greek, Euchenor, son
 Of Polyides the soothsayer, rich
 And brave in fight, and who in Corinth dwelt
 He, knowing well his fate, yet sail'd to Troy
 For Polyides oft, his reverend sire,
 Had prophecied that he should either die
 By some dire malady at home, or, slain
 By Trojan hands, amid the fleet of Greece.
 He, therefore, shunning the reproach alike
 Of the Achaians, and that dire disease,
 Had join'd the Grecian host; him Paris pierced
 The ear and jaw beneath; life at the stroke
 Left him, and darkness overspread his eyes.
 So raged the battle like devouring fire.
 But Hector dear to Jove not yet had learn'd,
 Nor aught surmised the havoc of his host
 Made on the left, where victory crown'd well-nigh
 The Grecians animated to the fight
 By Neptune seconding himself their arms.
 He, where he first had started through the gate
 After dispersion of the shielded Greeks
 Compact, still persevered. The galleys there
 Of Ajax and Protesila�s stood
 Updrawn above the hoary Deep; the wall
 Was there of humblest structure, and the steeds
 And warriors there conflicted furious most.
 The Epeans there and I�onians[12] robed-
 Prolix, the Phthians,[13] Locrians, and the bold
 Boetians check'd the terrible assault
 Of Hector, noble Chief, ardent as flame,
 Yet not repulsed him. Chosen Athenians form'd
 The van, by Peteos' son, Menestheus, led,
 Whose high command undaunted Bias shared,
 Phidas and Stichius. The Epean host
 Under Amphion, Dracius, Meges, fought.
 Podarces brave in arms the Phthians ruled,
 And Medon (Medon was by spurious birth
 Brother of Ajax O�liades,
 And for his uncle's death, whom he had slain,
 The brother of O�leus' wife, abode
 In Phylace; but from Iphiclus sprang
 Podarces;) these, all station'd in the front
 Of Phthias' hardy sons, together strove
 With the Boeotians for the fleet's defence.
 Ajax the swift swerved never from the side
 Of Ajax son of Telamon a step,
 But as in some deep fallow two black steers
 Labor combined, dragging the ponderous plow,
 The briny sweat around their rooted horns
 Oozes profuse; they, parted as they toil
 Along the furrow, by the yoke alone,
 Cleave to its bottom sheer the stubborn glebe,
 So, side by side, they, persevering fought.[14]
 The son of Telamon a people led
 Numerous and bold, who, when his bulky limbs
 Fail'd overlabor'd, eased him of his shield.
 Not so attended by his Locrians fought
 O�leus' valiant son; pitch'd battle them
 Suited not, unprovided with bright casques
 Of hairy crest, with ashen spears, and shields
 Of ample orb; for, trusting in the bow
 And twisted sling alone, they came to Troy,
 And broke with shafts and volley'd stones the ranks.
 Thus occupying, clad in burnish'd arms,
 The van, these two with Hector and his host
 Conflicted, while the Locrians from behind
 Vex'd them with shafts, secure; nor could the men
 Of Ilium stand, by such a shower confused.
 Then, driven with dreadful havoc thence, the foe
 To wind-swept Ilium had again retired.
 Had not Polydamas, at Hector's side
 Standing, the dauntless hero thus address'd.
 Hector! Thou ne'er canst listen to advice;
 But think'st thou, that if heaven in feats of arms
 Give thee pre-eminence, thou must excel
 Therefore in council also all mankind?
 No. All-sufficiency is not for thee.
 To one, superior force in arms is given,
 Skill to another in the graceful dance,
 Sweet song and powers of music to a third,
 And to a fourth loud-thundering Jove imparts
 Wisdom, which profits many, and which saves
 Whole cities oft, though reverenced but by few.
 Yet hear; I speak as wisest seems to me.
 War, like a fiery circle, all around
 Environs thee; the Trojans, since they pass'd
 The bulwark, either hold themselves aloof,
 Or, wide-dispersed among the galleys, cope
 With numbers far superior to their own.
 Retiring, therefore, summon all our Chiefs
 To consultation on the sum of all,
 Whether (should heaven so prosper us) to rush
 Impetuous on the gallant barks of Greece,
 Or to retreat secure; for much I dread
 Lest the Achaians punctually refund
 All yesterday's arrear, since yonder Chief[15]
 Insatiable with battle still abides
 Within the fleet, nor longer, as I judge,
 Will rest a mere spectator of the field.
 So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice
 Pleased Hector; from his chariot down he leap'd
 All arm'd, and in wing'd accents thus replied.
 Polydamas! here gather all the Chiefs;
 I haste into the fight, and my commands
 Once issued there, incontinent return.
 He ended, and conspicuous as the height
 Of some snow-crested mountain, shouting ranged
 The Trojans and confederates of Troy.
 They swift around Polydamas, brave son
 Of Panthus, at the voice of Hector, ran.
 Himself with hasty strides the front, meantime,
 Of battle roam'd, seeking from rank to rank
 Asius Hyrtacides, with Asius' son
 Adamas, and Deiphobus, and the might
 Of Helenus, his royal brother bold.
 Them neither altogether free from hurt
 He found, nor living all. Beneath the sterns
 Of the Achaian ships some slaughter'd lay
 By Grecian hands; some stricken by the spear
 Within the rampart sat, some by the sword.
 But leftward of the woful field he found,
 Ere long, bright Helen's paramour his band
 Exhorting to the fight. Hector approach'd,
 And him, in fierce displeasure, thus bespake.
 Curst Paris, specious, fraudulent and lewd!
 Where is Deiphobus, and where the might
 Of royal Helenus? Where Adamas
 Offspring of Asius, and where Asius, son
 Of Hyrtacus, and where Othryoneus?
 Now lofty Ilium from her topmost height
 Falls headlong, now is thy own ruin sure!
 To whom the godlike Paris thus replied.
 Since Hector! thou art pleased with no just cause
 To censure me, I may decline, perchance,
 Much more the battle on some future day,
 For I profess some courage, even I.
 Witness our constant conflict with the Greeks
 Here, on this spot, since first led on by thee
 The host of Troy waged battle at the ships.
 But those our friends of whom thou hast inquired
 Are slain, Deiphobus alone except
 And royal Helenus, who in the hand
 Bear each a wound inflicted by the spear,
 And have retired; but Jove their life preserved.
 Come now--conduct us whither most thine heart
 Prompts thee, and thou shalt find us ardent all
 To face like danger; what we can, we will,
 The best and most determined can no more.
 So saying, the hero soothed his brother's mind.
 Then moved they both toward the hottest war
 Together, where Polydamas the brave,
 Phalces, Cebriones, Orth�us fought,
 Palmys and Polyphoetes, godlike Chief,
 And Morys and Ascanius, gallant sons
 Both of Hippotion. They at Troy arrived
 From fair Ascania the preceding morn,
 In recompense for aid[16] by Priam lent
 Erewhile to Phrygia, and, by Jove impell'd,
 Now waged the furious battle side by side.
 The march of these at once, was as the sound
 Of mighty winds from deep-hung thunder-clouds
 Descending; clamorous the blast and wild
 With ocean mingles; many a billow, then,
 Upridged rides turbulent the sounding flood,
 Foam-crested billow after billow driven,
 So moved the host of Troy, rank after rank
 Behind their Chiefs, all dazzling bright in arms.
 Before them Priameian Hector strode
 Fierce as gore-tainted Mars, and his broad shield
 Advancing came, heavy with hides, and thick-
 Plated with brass; his helmet on his brows
 Refulgent shook, and in its turn he tried
 The force of every phalanx, if perchance
 Behind his broad shield pacing he might shake
 Their steadfast order; but he bore not down
 The spirit of the firm Achaian host.
 Then Ajax striding forth, him, first, defied.
 Approach. Why temptest thou the Greeks to fear?
 No babes are we in aught that appertains
 To arms, though humbled by the scourge of Jove.
 Thou cherishest the foolish hope to burn
 Our fleet with fire; but even we have hearts
 Prepared to guard it, and your populous Troy,
 By us dismantled and to pillage given,
 Shall perish sooner far. Know this thyself
 Also; the hour is nigh when thou shalt ask
 In prayer to Jove and all the Gods of heaven,
 That speed more rapid than the falcon's flight
 May wing thy coursers, while, exciting dense
 The dusty plain, they whirl thee back to Troy.
 While thus he spake, sublime on the right-hand
 An eagle soar'd; confident in the sign
 The whole Achaian host with loud acclaim
 Hail'd it. Then glorious Hector thus replied.
 Brainless and big, what means this boast of thine,
 Earth-cumberer Ajax? Would I were the son
 As sure, for ever, of almighty Jove
 And Juno, and such honor might receive
 Henceforth as Pallas and Apollo share,
 As comes this day with universal wo
 Fraught for the Grecians, among whom thyself
 Shalt also perish if thou dare abide
 My massy spear, which shall thy pamper'd flesh
 Disfigure, and amid the barks of Greece
 Falling, thou shalt the vultures with thy bulk
 Enormous satiate, and the dogs of Troy.
 He spake, and led his host; with clamor loud
 They follow'd him, and all the distant rear
 Came shouting on. On the other side the Greeks
 Re-echoed shout for shout, all undismay'd,
 And waiting firm the bravest of their foes.
 Upwent the double roar into the heights
 Ethereal, and among the beams of Jove.
