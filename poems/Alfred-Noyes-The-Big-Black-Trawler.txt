title: The Big Black Trawler

The very best ship that ever I knew,
--Ah-way O, to me O--
Was a big black trawler with a deep-sea crew--
Sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.

There was one old devil with a broken nose
--Ah-way O, to me O--
He was four score years, as I suppose--
But, sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.

We was wrecked last March, in a Polar storm
--Ah-way O, to me O--
And we asked the old cripple if his feet was warm--
Sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.

And the old, old devil (he was ninety at the most)
--Ah-way O, to me O--
Roars, "Ay, warm as a lickle piece of toast"--
So sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.

"For I soaked my sea-boots and my dungarees
--Ah-way O, to me O--
In the good salt water that the Lord don't freeze"--
Oh, sing, my bullies, let the bullgine run.
