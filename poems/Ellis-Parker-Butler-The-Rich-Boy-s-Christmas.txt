And now behold this sulking boy,
His costly presents bring no joy;
Harsh tears of anger fill his eye
Thoï¿½ he has all that wealth can buy.
What profits it that he employs
His many gifts to make a noise?
His playroom is so placed that he
Can cause his folks no agony.

Moral:

Mere worldly wealth does not possess
The power of giving happiness.
