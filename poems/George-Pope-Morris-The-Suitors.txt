Wealth sought the bower of Beauty,
 Dressed like a modern beau:
Just then Love, Health, and Duty
 Took up their hats to go.
Wealth such a cordial welcome met,
 As made the others grieve;
So Duty shunned the gay coquette,
 Love, pouting, took French leave--
He did!
 Love, pouting, took French leave!

Old Time, the friend of Duty,
 Next called to see the fair;
He laid his hand on Beauty,
 And left her in despair
Wealth vanished!--Last went rosy Health--
 And she was doomed to prove
That those who Duty slight for Wealth,
 Can never hope for Love!
Ah, no!
 Can never hope for Love!
