title: With A Rose
---

 In the heart of a rose
Lies the heart of a maid;
If you be not afraid
 You will wear it.Who knows?

 In the pink of its bloom,
Lay your lips to her cheek;
Since a rose cannot speak,
 And you gain the perfume.

 If the dews on the leaf
Are the tears from her eyes;
If she withers and dies,
 Why, you have the belief,

 That a rose cannot speak,
Though the heart of a maid
In its bosom must fade,
 And with fading must break.
