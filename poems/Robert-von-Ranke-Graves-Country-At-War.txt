 And what of home, how goes it, boys,
 While we die here in stench and noise?
 "The hill stands up and hedges wind
 Over the crest and drop behind;
 Here swallows dip and wild things go
 On peaceful errands to and fro
 Across the sloping meadow floor,
 And make no guess at blasting war.
 In woods that fledge the round hill-shoulder
 Leaves shoot and open, fall and moulder,
 And shoot again.Meadows yet show
 Alternate white of drifted snow
 And daisies.Children play at shop,
 Warm days, on the flat boulder-top,
 With wildflower coinage, and the wares
 Are bits of glass and unripe pears.
 Crows perch upon the backs of sheep,
 The wheat goes yellow:women reap,
 Autumn winds ruffle brook and pond,
 Flutter the hedge and fly beyond.
 So the first things of nature run,
 And stand not still for any one,
 Contemptuous of the distant cry
 Wherewith you harrow earth and sky.
 And high French clouds, praying to be
 Back, back in peace beyond the sea,
 Where nature with accustomed round
 Sweeps and garnishes the ground
 With kindly beauty, warm or cold, 
 Alternate seasons never old:
 Heathen, how furiously you rage,
 Cursing this blood and brimstone age,
 How furiously against your will
 You kill and kill again, and kill:
 All thought of peace behind you cast,
 Till like small boys with fear aghast,
 Each cries for God to understand,
 'I could not help it, it was my hand.'"
