title: Belgravia By Night. "Move On!"

 "The foxes have holes,
 And the birds of the air have nests,
 But where shall the heads of the sons of men
 Be laid, be laid?"

 "Where the cold corpse rests,
 Where the sightless moles
 Burrow and yet cannot make it afraid,
 Rout but cannot wake it again,
 There shall the heads of the sons of men
 Be laid, laid!"
