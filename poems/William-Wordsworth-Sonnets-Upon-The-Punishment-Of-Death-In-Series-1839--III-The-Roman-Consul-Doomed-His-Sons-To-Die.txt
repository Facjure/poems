title: Sonnets Upon The Punishment Of Death - In Series, 1839 ï¿½ III - The Roman Consul Doomed His Sons To Die
---

 The Roman Consul doomed his sons to die
 Who had betrayed their country. The stern word
 Afforded (may it through all time afford)
 A theme for praise and admiration high.
 Upon the surface of humanity
 He rested not; its depths his mind explored;
 He felt; but his parental bosom's lord
 Was Duty, Duty calmed his agony.
 And some, we know, when they by willful act
 A single human life have wrongly taken,
 Pass sentence on themselves, confess the fact,
 And, to atone for it, with soul unshaken
 Kneel at the feet of Justice, and, for faith
 Broken with all mankind, solicit death.
