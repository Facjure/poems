Father in Heaven, to thee,
Guardian and friend,
Lowly the suppliant knee
Here would we bend! - 
Blessing thee ere we part,
Each with a grateful heart,
For all thy love doth send - 
Plenteous and free!

Thanks for thy hand outspread
Ever in power
O'er each defenceless head
In danger's hour!
Thanks for the light arid love,
From thy full fount above - 
A rich and constant shower,
O'er us still shed!

Go thou with us, we pray,
Whom duties call
To our high tasks away,
Each one, and all, - 
Go, with thy Spirit's might,
Go, with thy Gospel's light
 - Whatever may befall - 
With us alway

Now let thy blessing rest
On us anew - 
Brother, and friend, and guest,
Tried ones and true - 
Till, all Our pirtings o'er,
Meeting, to part no more,
In Heaven we renew
Friendships so blest
