OD. iv. 13.


Lyce, the gods have listened to my prayer;
The gods have listened, Lyce. Thou art grey,
 And still would'st thou seem fair;
 Still unshamed drink, and play,

And, wine-flushed, woo slow-answering Love with weak
Shrill pipings. With young Chia He doth dwell,
 Queen of the harp; her cheek
 Is his sweet citadel:-

He marked the withered oak, and on he flew
Intolerant; shrank from Lyce grim and wrinkled,
 Whose teeth are ghastly-blue,
 Whose temples snow-besprinkled:-

Not purple, not the brightest gem that glows,
Brings back to her the years which, fleeting fast,
 Time hath once shut in those
 Dark annals of the Past.

Oh, where is all thy loveliness? soft hue
And motions soft? Oh, what of Her doth rest,
 Her, who breathed love, who drew
 My heart out of my breast?

Fair, and far-famed, and subtly sweet, thy face
Ranked next to Cinara's. But to Cinara fate
 Gave but a few years' grace;
 And lets live, all too late,

Lyce, the rival of the beldam crow:
That fiery youth may see with scornful brow
 The torch that long ago
 Beamed bright, a cinder now.
