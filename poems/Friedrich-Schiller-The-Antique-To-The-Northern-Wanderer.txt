Thou hast crossed over torrents, and swung through wide-spreading ocean, 
Over the chain of the Alps dizzily bore thee the bridge,
That thou might'st see me from near, and learn to value my beauty,
Which the voice of renown spreads through the wandering world.
And now before me thou standest, canst touch my altar so holy, 
But art thou nearer to me, or am I nearer to thee?
