 As Jesus and his followers
 Upon a Sabbath morn
 Were walking by a wheat field
 They plucked the ears of corn.

 They plucked it, they rubbed it,
 They blew the husks away,
 Which grieved the pious pharisees
 Upon the Sabbath day.

 And Jesus said, "A riddle
 Answer if you can,
 Was man made for the Sabbath
 Or Sabbath made for man?"

 I do not love the Sabbath,
 The soapsuds and the starch,
 The troops of solemn people
 Who to Salvation march.

 I take my book, I take my stick
 On the Sabbath day,
 In woody nooks and valleys
 I hide myself away.

 To ponder there in quiet
 God's Universal Plan,
 Resolved that church and Sabbath
 Were never made for man.
