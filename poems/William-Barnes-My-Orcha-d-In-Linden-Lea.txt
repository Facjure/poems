title: My Orcha'd In Linden Lea
---

�Ithin the woodlands, flow�ry gleaded,
By the woak tree�s mossy moot,
The sheenen grass-bleades, timber-sheaded,
Now do quiver under voot;
An� birds do whissle over head,
An� water�s bubblen in its bed,
An� there vor me the apple tree
Do lean down low in Linden Lea.
When leaves that leately wer a-springen
Now do feade �ithin the copse,
An� painted birds do hush their zingen
Up upon the timber�s tops;
An� brown-leav�d fruit�s a-turnen red,
In cloudless zunsheen, over head,
Wi� fruit vor me, the apple tree
Do lean down low in Linden Lea.

Let other vo�k meake money vaster
In the air o� dark-room�d towns,
I don�t dread a peevish measter;
Though noo man do heed my frowns,
I be free to goo abrode,
Or teake agean my hwomeward road
To where, vor me, the apple tree
Do lean down low in Linden Lea.
