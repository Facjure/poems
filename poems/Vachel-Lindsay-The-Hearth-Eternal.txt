 There dwelt a widow learned and devout,
 Behind our hamlet on the eastern hill.
 Three sons she had, who went to find the world.
 They promised to return, but wandered still.
 The cities used them well, they won their way,
 Rich gifts they sent, to still their mother's sighs.
 Worn out with honors, and apart from her,
 They died as many a self-made exile dies.
 The mother had a hearth that would not quench,
 The deathless embers fought the creeping gloom.
 She said to us who came with wondering eyes - 
 "This is a magic fire, a magic room."
 The pine burned out, but still the coals glowed on,
 Her grave grew old beneath the pear-tree shade,
 And yet her crumbling home enshrined the light.
 The neighbors peering in were half afraid.
 Then sturdy beggars, needing fagots, came,
 One at a time, and stole the walls, and floor.
 They left a naked stone, but how it blazed!
 And in the thunderstorm it flared the more.
 And now it was that men were heard to say,
 "This light should be beloved by all the town."
 At last they made the slope a place of prayer,
 Where marvellous thoughts from God came sweeping down.
 They left their churches crumbling in the sun,
 They met on that soft hill, one brotherhood;
 One strength and valor only, one delight,
 One laughing, brooding genius, great and good.
 Now many gray-haired prodigals come home,
 The place out-flames the cities of the land,
 And twice-born Brahmans reach us from afar,
 With subtle eyes prepared to understand.
 Higher and higher burns the eastern steep,
 Showing the roads that march from every place,
 A steady beacon o'er the weary leagues,
 At dead of night it lights the traveller's face!
 Thus has the widow conquered half the earth,
 She who increased in faith, though all alone,
 Who kept her empty house a magic place,
 Has made the town a holy angel's throne.
