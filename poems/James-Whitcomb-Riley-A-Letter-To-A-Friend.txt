title: A Letter To A Friend
---

 The past is like a story
 I have listened to in dreams
 That vanished in the glory
 Of the Morning's early gleams;
 And - at my shadow glancing -
 I feel a loss of strength,
 As the Day of Life advancing
 Leaves it shorn of half its length.

 But it's all in vain to worry
 At the rapid race of Time -
 And he flies in such a flurry
 When I trip him with a rhyme,
 I'll bother him no longer
 Than to thank you for the thought
 That "my fame is growing stronger
 As you really think it ought."

 And though I fall below it,
 I might know as much of mirth
 To live and die a poet
 Of unacknowledged worth;
 For Fame is but a vagrant -
 Though a loyal one and brave,
 And his laurels ne'er so fragrant
 As when scattered o'er the grave.
