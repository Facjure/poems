On seeing BRET HARTE come upon the Bench.

Thanks for an hour of laughing
 In a world that is growing old;
Thanks for an hour of weeping
 In a world that is growing cold;
For we who have wept with Dickens,
 And we who have laughed with Boz,
Have renewed the days of our childhood
 With his American Coz.
