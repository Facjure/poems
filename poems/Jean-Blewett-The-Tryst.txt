The harvest moon in yellow haze
 Is steeping all the sea and land,
Is kindling paths and shining ways
 Around the hills, across the sand.

And there are only thou and I - 
 O sweetheart, I've no eyes to note
The glory of the sea and sky,
 I see a softly rounded throat,

A face uplifted, pure and sweet,
 Two blue eyes filled with trust and love;
Enough, the sea sings at our feet,
 The harvest moon sails just above.
