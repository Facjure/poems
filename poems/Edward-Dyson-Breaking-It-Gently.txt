title: Breaking It Gently
---

All was up with Richard Tanner 
�Wait-a-Bit� we called him. Dead?
Yes. The braceman dropped a spanner,
Landed Richard on the head;
Cracked his skull, sir, like a teacup,
Down the pump-shaft in the well.
Braceman hadn�t time to speak up,
Tanner never knew what fell.

Tell the widow? Who�d go through it?
No one on the shift would stir;
But Pat Ryan said he�d do it 
�Nately break the news to her.�
Pat�s a splitter, and a kinder
Heart I never wish to know.
Stephens told him where to find her,
Begged him gently deal the blow.

In a very solemn manner
Ryan met the dead man�s wife 
�Mornin� to yez, Widdy Tanner!�
Says he gravely, �Such is life!�
�I�m no widow!� says she, prying
For the joke in Ryan�s eye.
��Scuse me, mum,� says Paddy, sighing,
��Scuse me, mum, but that�s a lie.�

�That remark would be repented
If Dick Tanner heard,� says she.
�Meanin�, mum, the late lamented
Party av that name?� says he.
Still the widow missed the notion,
Wonder only filled her eye;
So Pat smothered his emotion,
Gulped, and had another try.

��Tis like this, ye see, me honey,
I�ve been sint t� let ye know
Ye�ve inherited some money 
Twilve �r fifteen pounds �r so.
Through a schame av Providence�s,
Which no mortal man could dodge;
Poor Dick�s funeral expenses
Have fell due, mum, at the lodge!�
