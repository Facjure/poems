 Enlightened Teacher, gladly from thy hand
 Have I received this proof of pains bestowed
 By Thee to guide thy Pupils on the road
 That, in our native isle, and every land,
 The Church, when trusting in divine command
 And in her Catholic attributes, hath trod:
 O may these lessons be with profit scanned
 To thy heart's wish, thy labour blest by God!
 So the bright faces of the young and gay
 Shall look more bright, the happy, happier still;
 Catch, in the pauses of their keenest play,
 Motions of thought which elevate the will
 And, like the Spire that from your classic Hill
 Points heavenward, indicate the end and way.
