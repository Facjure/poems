title: To Jessica, Gone Back To The City
---

Sence fair Jessica hez left us
Seems ez ef she hed bereft us,
When she went, o� half o� livin�;
Fer we never knowed she�d driven
Into us so much content,
Till fair Jessica hed went.
(Knowed a feller once thet cried
When his yaller dog hed died.)

We hain�t near ez bright an� chirky,
An� the sun shines blue an� murky,
Kind o� sadly an� dishearted,
Like ets sperret bed departed;
Just ez ef ets joy bed ceased
Sence fair Jessica �s gone East.
(Not but what ets always sober
Sort o� weather in October.)

Then the posies, too, seems human,
An� hez all quit o� their bloomin�;
An� the trees they show a pallor
An� hey turned a heart-sick yaller,
Sayin�, �No use livin� on
Ef fair Jessica hez gone.�
(Folks thet knows sez this ez all
Very common in the fall.)

Truth ez, I�m a-feelin� sadly;
Things ez goin� kind o� badly
Round my heart an� other vitals
(Brings on poetry recitals
O� my woes �most ev�ry day)
Sence fair Jessica�s away.
(Kind o� think thet I will haf ter
Smoke a leetle less hereafter.)

But, with fun aside, you know,
We�re blamed sorry she must go;
An� we hope she�ll think, maybe,
�Z well o� us ez we o� she.
