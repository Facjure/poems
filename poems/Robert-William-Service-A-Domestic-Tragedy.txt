 Clorinda met me on the way
 As I came from the train;
 Her face was anything but gay,
 In fact, suggested pain.
 "Oh hubby, hubby dear!" she cried,
 "I've awful news to tell. . . ."
 "What is it, darling?" I replied;
 "Your mother - is she well?"

 "Oh no! oh no! it is not that,
 It's something else," she wailed,
 My heart was beating pit-a-pat,
 My ruddy visage paled.
 Like lightning flash in heaven's dome
 The fear within me woke:
 "Don't say," I cried, "our little home
 Has all gone up in smoke!"

 She shook her head. Oh, swift I clasped
 And held her to my breast;
 "The children! Tell me quick," I gasped,
 "Believe me, it is best."
 Then, then she spoke; 'mid sobs I caught
 These words of woe divine:
 "It's coo-coo-cook has gone and bought
 A new hat just like mine."
