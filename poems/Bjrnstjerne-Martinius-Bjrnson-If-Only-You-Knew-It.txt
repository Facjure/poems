title: If Only You Knew It
---

 I dare never speak up to you,
 For you to look down would not do,
 But always you are there each day,
 And always I wander this way.
Our thoughts go by stealth to make search and renew it,
But neither dares question nor give answer due it;
 If only you knew it!

 When constantly I could be found,
 You often in pride on me frowned;
 But now that I rarely appear,
 I see that you wait for me here!
Two eyes, oh, two eyes made a snare and then drew it,
And who would escape must beware, and eschew it!
 If only you knew it!

 Yes, if you but guessed, this might be
 A poem for you made by me,
 Whose billowy lines just now fly
 Up where you stand graceful and high!
But look you, this knowledge, to no purpose grew it,
I farther will go, Heaven guard, lest we rue it, - 
 If only you knew it!
