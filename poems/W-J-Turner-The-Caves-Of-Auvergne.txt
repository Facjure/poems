He carved the red deer and the bull
 Upon the smooth cave rock,
Returned from war with belly full,
 And scarred with many a knock,
He carved the red deer and the bull
 Upon the smooth cave rock.

The stars flew by the cave's wide door,
 The clouds wild trumpets blew,
Trees rose in wild dreams from the floor,
 Flowers with dream faces grew
Up to the sky, and softly hung
 Golden and white and blue.

The woman ground her heap of corn,
 Her heart a guarded fire;
The wind played in his trembling soul
 Like a hand upon a lyre,
The wind drew faintly on the stone
 Symbols of his desire:

The red deer of the forest dark,
 Whose antlers cut the sky,
That vanishes into the mirk
 And like a dream flits by,
And by an arrow slain at last
 Is but the wind's dark body.

The bull that stands in marshy lakes
 As motionless and still
As a dark rock jutting from a plain
 Without a tree or hill,
The bull that is the sign of life,
 Its sombre, phallic will.

And from the dead, white eyes of them
 The wind springs up anew,
It blows upon the trembling heart,
 And bull and deer renew
Their flitting life in the dim past
 When that dead Hunter drew.

I sit beside him in the night,
 And, fingering his red stone,
I chase through endless forests dark
 Seeking that thing unknown,
That which is not red deer or bull,
 But which by them was shown:

By those stiff shapes in which he drew
 His soul's exalted cry,
When flying down the forest dark
 He slew and knew not why,
When he was filled with song, and strength
 Flowed to him from the sky.

The wind blows from red deer and bull,
 The clouds wild trumpets blare,
Trees rise in wild dreams from the earth,
 Flowers with dream faces stare,
'O Hunter, your own shadow stands
 Within your forest lair!'
