We shall see her no more
 On the balcony,
Smiling, while hurt, at the roar
 As of surging sea
From the stormy sturdy band
 Who have doomed her lord's cause,
Though she waves her little hand
 As it were applause.

Here will be candidates yet,
 And candidates' wives,
Fervid with zeal to set
 Their ideals on our lives:
Here will come market-men
 On the market-days,
Here will clash now and then
 More such party assays.

And the balcony will fill
 When such times are renewed,
And the throng in the street will thrill
 With to-day's mettled mood;
But she will no more stand
 In the sunshine there,
With that wave of her white-gloved hand,
 And that chestnut hair.

January 1906.
