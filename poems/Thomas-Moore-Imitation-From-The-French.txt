With women and apples both Paris and Adam
Made mischief enough in their day:--
God be praised that the fate of mankind, my dear Madam,
Depends not on us, the same way.
For, weak as I am with temptation to grapple,
The world would have doubly to rue thee:

Like Adam, I'd gladly take from thee the apple,
Like Paris, at once give it to thee.
