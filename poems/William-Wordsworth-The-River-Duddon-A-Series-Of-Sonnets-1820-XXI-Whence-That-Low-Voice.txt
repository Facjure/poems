title: The River Duddon - A Series Of Sonnets, 1820. - XXI - Whence That Low Voice?
---

 Whence that low voice? A whisper from the heart,
 That told of days long past, when here I roved
 With friends and kindred tenderly beloved;
 Some who had early mandates to depart,
 Yet are allowed to steal my path athwart
 By Duddon's side; once more do we unite,
 Once more, beneath the kind Earth's tranquil light;
 And smothered joys into new being start.
 From her unworthy seat, the cloudy stall
 Of Time, breaks forth triumphant Memory;
 Her glistening tresses bound, yet light and free
 As golden locks of birch, that rise and fall
 On gales that breathe too gently to recall
 Aught of the fading year's inclemency!
