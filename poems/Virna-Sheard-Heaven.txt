Not with the haloed saints would Heaven be
 For such as I;
Who have not reached to their serenity
 So sweet and high.

Not with the martyrs washed by holy flame
 Could I find place,
For they are victors who through glory came
 To see God's face.

Not with the perfect souls that enter there
 Could mine abide,
For clouded eyes from eyes all cloudless fair
 'Twere best to hide.

And not for me the wondrous streets of gold
 Or crystal sea - 
I only know the brown earth, worn and old,
 Where sinners be.

Unless I found those who to me belong,
 My dear and own,
I, in the vastness of that shining throng,
 Would be alone.

God guide us to some sun-blessed little star,
 We ask not where,
Nor whether it be near or it be far,
 So Love is there.
