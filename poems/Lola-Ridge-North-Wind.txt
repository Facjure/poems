I love you, malcontent
Male wind - 
Shaking the pollen from a flower
Or hurling the sea backward from the grinning sand.

Blow on and over my dreams...
Scatter my sick dreams...
Throw your lusty arms about me...
Envelop all my hot body...
Carry me to pine forests - 
Great, rough-bearded forests...
Bring me to stark plains and steppes...
I would have the North to-night - 
The cold, enduring North.

And if we should meet the Snow,
Whirling in spirals,
And he should blind my eyes...
Ally, you will defend me - 
You will hold me close,
Blowing on my eyelids.
