title: Rain And Wind
---

 I hear the hoofs of horses
 Galloping over the hill,
 Galloping on and galloping on,
 When all the night is shrill
 With wind and rain that beats the pane,
 And my soul with awe is still.

 For every dripping window
 Their headlong rush makes bound,
 Galloping up, and galloping by,
 Then back again and around,
 Till the gusty roofs ring with their hoofs,
 And the draughty cellars sound.

 And then I hear black horsemen
 Hallooing in the night;
 Hallooing and hallooing,
 They ride o'er vale and height,
 And the branches snap and the shutters clap
 With the fury of their flight.

 Then at each door a horseman,
 With burly bearded lip
 Hallooing through the keyhole,
 Pauses with cloak a-drip;
 And the door-knob shakes and the panel quakes
 'Neath the anger of his whip.

 All night I hear their gallop,
 And their wild halloo's alarm;
 The tree-tops sound and vanes go round
 In forest and on farm;
 But never a hair of a thing is there,
 Only the wind and storm.
