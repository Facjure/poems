Above its domes the gulfs accumulate
 To where the sea-winds trumpet forth their screed;
 But here the buried waters take no heed -
Deaf, and with clos�d lips from press of weight
Imposed by ocean. Dim, inanimate,
 On temples of an unremembered creed
 Involved in long, slow tentacles of weed,
The dead tide lies immovable as Fate.

From out the ponderous-vaulted ocean-dome,
 A clouded light is questionably shed
On altars of a goddess garlanded
 With blossoms of some weird and hueless vine;
And wing�d, fleet, through skies beneath the foam,
 Like silent birds the sea-things dart and shine.
