I.

Where the snow-world of the mountains
Fronts the sea-like world of sward,
And encamped along the prairies
Tower the white peaks heavenward;
Where they stand by dawn rose-coloured
Or dim-silvered by the stars,
And behind their shadowed portals
Evening draws her lurid bars,
Lies a country whose sweet grasses
Richly clothe the rolling plain;
All its swelling upland pastures
Speak of Plenty's happy reign;
There the bison herds in autumn
Roamed wide sunlit solitudes,
Seamed with many an azure river
Bright in burnished poplar woods.


II.

Night-dews pearled the painted hide-tents,
"Moyas" named, that on the mead
Sheltered dark-eyed women wearing
Braided hair and woven bead.
Never man had seen their lodges,
Never warrior crossed the slopes
Where they rode, and where they hunted
Imu bulls and antelopes.
Masterless, how swift their riding!
While the wild steeds onward flew,
From round breasts and arms unburdened
Freedom's winds their tresses blew.
Only when the purple shadows
Slowly veiled the darkening plain
Would they sorrow that the Sun-god
Dearer loved his Alp's domain.


III.

Southward, nearer to the gorges
Whence the sudden warm winds blow,
Shaking all the pine's huge branches,
Melting all the fallen snow,
Dwelt the Sï¿½ksika, the Blackfeet;
They whose ancestor, endued,
With the dark salve's magic fleetness,
First on foot the deer pursued.
Gallantly the Braves bore torture
While their Sun-dance fasts were held,
While the drums beat, and the virgins
Saw the pains by manhood quelled.
As each writhing form triumphant
Called on the Great Spirit's might,
On his son, whose voice in thunder
Summons airy hosts to fight.


IV.

"Star-Child," praised as bearing all things,
Praised as Brave who never feared,
Young, but famed above his elders,
Chief to man and maid endeared,
Went with comrades, quiver-harnessed,
O'er the hills, and face to face,
Where the bright leaves trembled round them,
Found the fearless huntress race
Was it peace or was it warfare?
Starting back, their bows they drew,
But a mystic power compelled them,
And no word, no arrow flew.
Nearer to each other drawing,
Strength and beauty beckoned "Peace,"
Each the other envious eyeing,
Jealous lest their hunt should cease!


V.

"They are strong; could not they aid us?"
Thought the maiden band amazed;
"Conquered, these could well obey us!"
Dreamed the warriors as they gazed.
Falsely answered cunning "Star-Child,"
Smiling as they slowly met,
While the women's frequent questions
Were to laughter's music set,
"Who is chief among you, tell us?"
"He is far! Is she your queen
With the shells and deer-teeth broidered,
Decked with sheen of gold between?"
"Yea; she slays the bear, the grizzly:
Light her empire on us lies;
With the love she rules her courser
Guides and guards us 'Laughing Eyes'!"


VI.

Vaunted then the men their "Star-Child:"
"Peerless soldier, keen-eyed king!
From the girl he weds shall heroes
Worthy war-god's lineage spring.
Know ye not how old enchantment
Saw his storm-born sire appear,
Armed, upon a peak dark-lifted
O'er the snows and glaciers drear?
His the darts divine, whose breaking
Thrice hath some disaster sent,
Shafts that killed and then returning,
Kept his armoury unspent."
"Give us of these arrows. Bring him!"
Cried the maidens. "Nay," they said;
"Come with us and share our hunting
Ere the autumn leaves are shed."


VII.

Answered they: "In painted lodges
Berries we have dried and meat;
Come again! e'er comes the winter,
Let us hear your horses' feet."
And they sprang into their saddles,
Swept, white-splashing, through a stream
Red and saffron hued, the pageant
Crossed the blue translucent gleam.
Then unwilling, as they vanished,
"Star-Child" slow to camp returned;
Told the council of the Blackfeet
All the marvels he had learned;
Dressed him in his chief's apparel,
Rode to where, within the glen,
Lay the trail that led him onward
To the town, unknown of men.


VIII.

From each Moya thronged the dwellers:
"Hath the chief the arrows sent?"
"I am Chief; behold me; trust me.
Lead me to your ruler's tent."
"He hath not the shafts enchanted;
Thus unarmed came never chief!"
Bent a thousand bows around him:
"Back or die, impostor, thief!"
Angry, yet afraid to anger,
Lest he lose those "Laughing-Eyes,"
He, obeying, vowed to conquer;
Scorning to make vain replies,
Went; and weary seemed the journey!
All along the yellow plain
Red as rose-leaves in the grasses
Flushed his dusky cheeks with pain.


IX.

Grave, in silent circles seated
'Neath their Moya's smoke-tanned cone,
Round the fire his chieftains heard him,
Holding each a pipe's red stone.
Pausing long, they gave their counsel,
Different from their wont; for here
All the young men spoke for kindness,
All the old men were severe.
But the Braves rode forth at morning,
Half the magic darts they bore;
Pledge so precious of their friendship
None had thought to give before!
To the huntress nation welcome,
Waking song in every tent,
Where the hours were passed in feasting
And the days to love were lent!


X.

Thus the maidens were the victors,
For to them the warriors came:
"Laughing-Eyes" but loved the "Star-Child"
When his shafts her own became.
Ah! but where is man or woman
Who may boast of triumph long?
Nought abides, and mighty nations
Cannot ever more be strong.
So each huntress found a master,
Yielding to her heart's new birth,
And no more along the prairie
Beat her steed the sounding earth.
Yearly yet the Blackfeet women
Meet and dance and sing the day
When through love they won, and, winning,
Freedom passed with love away!
