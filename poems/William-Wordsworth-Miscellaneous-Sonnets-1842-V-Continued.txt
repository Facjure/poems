 Who ponders National events shall find
 An awful balancing of loss and gain,
 Joy based on sorrow, good with ill combined,
 And proud deliverance issuing out of pain
 And direful throes; as if the All-ruling Mind,
 With whose perfection it consists to ordain
 Volcanic burst, earthquake, and hurricane,
 Dealt in like sort with feeble human kind
 By laws immutable. But woe for him
 Who thus deceived shall lend an eager hand
 To social havoc. Is not Conscience ours,
 And Truth, whose eye guilt only can make dim;
 And Will, whose office, by divine command,
 Is to control and check disordered Powers?
