 Unto the soul's companionship
 Of things that only seem to be,
 Earth points with magic fingertip
 And bids thee see
 How Fancy keeps thee company.

 For oft at dawn hast not beheld
 A spirit of prismatic hue
 Blow wide the buds, which night has swelled?
 And stain them through
 With heav'n's ethereal gold and blue?

 While at her side another went
 With gleams of enigmatic white?
 A spirit who distributes scent,
 To vale and height,
 In footsteps of the rosy light?

 And oft at dusk hast thou not seen
 The star-fays bring their caravans
 Of dew, and glitter all the green,
 Night's shadow tans,
 From many starbeam sprinkling-cans?

 Nor watched with these the elfins go
 Who tune faint instruments? whose sound
 Is that moon-music insects blow
 When all the ground
 Sleeps, and the night is hushed around?
