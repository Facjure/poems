Our altar is the dewy sod 
Our temple yon blue throne of God:
No priestly rite our souls to bind 
We bow before the Almighty Mind.

Oh, Thou whose realm is wide as air 
Thou wilt not spurn the Gipsies' prayer:
Though banned and barred by all beside,
Be Thou the Outcast's guard and guide.

Poor fragments of a Nation wrecked 
Its story whelmed in Time's neglect 
We drift unheeded on the wave,
If God refuse the lost to save.

Yet though we name no Fatherland 
And though we clasp no kindred hand 
Though houseless, homeless wanderers we 
Oh give us Hope, and Heaven with Thee!
