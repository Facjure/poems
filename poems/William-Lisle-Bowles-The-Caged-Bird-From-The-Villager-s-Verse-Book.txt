 Oh, who would keep a little bird confined,
 When cowslip bells are nodding in the wind;
 When every hedge as with "good morrow" rings,
 And, heard from wood to coombe, the blackbird sings!
 Oh! who would keep a little bird confined
 In his cold wiry prison? Let him fly,
 And hear him sing: How sweet is liberty!
