Elfin &amp; gold bug,
genie in the
twilight of a cave.

Virgin On The Rocks
 - Da Vinci's painting - 
aura light seeping toward
sun-lit crack of day,
the Master's Mona Lisa
in the Louvre
raptured,
luminescence amid aging pigment
steeping about rapt multitude.

Betwixt pit &amp; pendulum,
another canvas - 
Da Vinci in a beatific pose
(warm light of the room),
gentle finger pointing upward,
a puzzled crowd
with nowhere to see.
