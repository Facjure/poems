title: The Boy Lives On Our Farm
---

The boy lives on our Farm, he's not
 Afeard o' horses none!
An' he can make 'em lope, er trot,
 Er rack, er pace, er run.
Sometimes he drives two horses, when
 He comes to town an' brings
A wagon-full o' 'taters nen,
 An' roastin'-ears an' things.

Two horses is "a team," he says,
 An' when you drive er hitch,
The right-un's a "near-horse," I guess
 Er "off" - I don't know which -
The Boy lives on our Farm, he told
 Me, too, 'at he can see,
By lookin' at their teeth, how old
 A horse is, to a T!

I'd be the gladdest boy alive
 Ef I knowed much as that,
An' could stand up like him an' drive,
 An' ist push back my hat,
Like he comes skallyhootin' through
 Our alley, with one arm
A-wavin' Fare-ye-well! to you -
 The Boy lives on our Farm!
