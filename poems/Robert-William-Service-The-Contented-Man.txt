 "How good God is to me," he said;
 "For have I not a mansion tall,
 With trees and lawns of velvet tread,
 And happy helpers at my call?
 With beauty is my life abrim,
 With tranquil hours and dreams apart;
 You wonder that I yield to Him
 That best of prayers, a grateful heart?"

 "How good God is to me," he said;
 "For look! though gone is all my wealth,
 How sweet it is to earn one's bread
 With brawny arms and brimming health.
 Oh, now I know the joy of strife!
 To sleep so sound, to wake so fit.
 Ah yes, how glorious is life!
 I thank Him for each day of it."

 "How good God is to me," he said;
 "Though health and wealth are gone, it's true;
 Things might be worse, I might be dead,
 And here I'm living, laughing too.
 Serene beneath the evening sky
 I wait, and every man's my friend;
 God's most contented man am I . . .
 He keeps me smiling to the End."
