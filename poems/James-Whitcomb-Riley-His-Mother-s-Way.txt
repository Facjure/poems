Tomps 'ud allus haf to say
Somepin' 'bout "his mother's way." - 
He lived hard-like - never jined
Any church of any kind. - 
"It was Mother's way," says he,
"To be good enough fer me
And her too, - and certinly
Lord has heerd her pray!"
Propped up on his dyin' bed, - 
"Shore as Heaven's overhead,
I'm a-goin' there," he said
"It was Mother's way."
