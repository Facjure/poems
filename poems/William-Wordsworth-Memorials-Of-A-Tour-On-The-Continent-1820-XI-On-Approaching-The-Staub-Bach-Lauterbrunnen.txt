 Uttered by whom, or how inspired designed
 For what strange service, does this concert reach
 Our ears, and near the dwellings of mankind!
 'Mid fields familiarized to human speech? 
 No Mermaid's warble to allay the wind
 Driving some vessel toward a dangerous beach,
 More thrilling melodies; Witch answering Witch,
 To chant a love-spell, never intertwined
 Notes shrill and wild with art more musical:
 Alas! that from the lips of abject Want
 Or Idleness in tatters mendicant
 The strain should flow, free Fancy to enthrall,
 And with regret and useless pity haunt
 This bold, this bright, this sky-born, waterfall!
