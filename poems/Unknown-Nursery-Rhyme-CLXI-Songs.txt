Wooley Foster has gone to sea,
With silver buckles at his knee,
When he comes back he'll marry me, - 
Bonny Wooley Foster!

Wooley Foster has a cow,
Black and white about the mow,
Open the gates and let her through,
Wooley Foster's ain cow!

Wooley Foster has a hen,
Cockle button, cockle ben,
She lay eggs for gentlemen,
But none for Wooley Foster!
