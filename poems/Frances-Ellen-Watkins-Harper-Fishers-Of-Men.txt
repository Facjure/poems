 I had a dream, a varied dream:
 Before my ravished sight
 The city of my Lord arose,
 With all its love and light.

 The music of a myriad harps
 Flowed out with sweet accord;
 And saints were casting down their crowns
 In homage to our Lord.


 My heart leaped up with untold joy,
 Life's toil and pain were o'er;
 My weary feet at last had found
 The bright and restful shore.

 Just as I reached the gates of light,
 Ready to enter in,
 From earth arose a fearful cry
 Of sorrow and of sin.

 I turned, and saw behind me surge
 A wild and stormy sea;
 And drowning men were reaching out
 Imploring hands to me.

 And ev'ry lip was blanched with dread,
 And moaning for relief;
 The music of the golden harps
 Grew fainter for their grief.

 Let me return, I quickly said,
 Close to the pearly gate;
 My work is with these wretched ones,
 So wrecked and desolate.

 An angel smiled and gently said:
 This is the gate of life,
 Wilt thou return to earth's sad scenes,
 Its weariness and strife,
