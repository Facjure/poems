They came, the brothers, and took two chairs
 In their usual quiet way;
And for a time we did not think
 They had much to say.

And they began and talked awhile
 Of ordinary things,
Till spread that silence in the room
 A pent thought brings.

And then they said: "The end has come.
 Yes: it has come at last."
And we looked down, and knew that day
 A spirit had passed.
