title: Going East.

 She came from the East a fair, young bride,
 With a light and a bounding heart,
 To find in the distant West a home
 With her husband to make a start.

 He builded his cabin far away,
 Where the prairie flower bloomed wild;
 Her love made lighter all his toil,
 And joy and hope around him smiled.

 She plied her hands to life's homely tasks,
 And helped to build his fortunes up;
 While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet,
 Were mingled and mixed in her cup.

 He sowed in his fields of golden grain,
 All the strength of his manly prime;
 Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees,
 Was as sweet as the dollar's chime.

 She toiled and waited through weary years
 For the fortune that came at length;
 But toil and care and hope deferred,
 Had stolen and wasted her strength.

 The cabin changed to a stately home,
 Rich carpets were hushing her tread;
 But light was fading from her eye,
 And the bloom from her cheek had fled.

 Slower and heavier grew her step,
 While his gold and his gains increased;
 But his proud domain had not the charm
 Of her humble home in the East.

 Within her eye was a restless light,
 And a yearning that never ceased,
 A longing to see the dear old home
 She had left in the distant East.

 A longing to clasp her mother's hand,
 And nestle close to her heart,
 And to feel the heavy cares of life
 Like the sun-kissed shadows depart.

 Her husband was adding field to field,
 And new wealth to his golden store;
 And little thought the shadow of death
 Was entering in at his door.

 He had no line to sound the depths
 Of her tears repressed and unshed;
 Nor dreamed 'mid plenty a human heart
 Could be starving, but not for bread.

 The hungry heart was stilled at last;
 Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.
 A lonely man sat by the bier
 Of a corpse that was going East.
