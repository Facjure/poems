 The hills again reach skyward with a smile.
Again, with waking life along its way,
 The landscape marches westward mile on mile
And time throbs white into another day.

 Though eager life must wait on livelihood,
And all our hopes be tethered to the mart,
 Lacking the eagle's wild, high freedom, would
That ours might be this day the eagle's heart!
