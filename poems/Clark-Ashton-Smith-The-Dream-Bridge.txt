All drear and barren seemed the hours,
 That passed rain-swept and tempest-blown.
The dead leaves fell like brownish notes
 Within the rain's grey monotone.

There came a lapse between the showers;
 The clouds grew rich with sunset gleams;
Then o'er the sky a rainbow sprang -
 A bridge unto the Land of Dreams.
