 To help our tired hope to toil,
 Lo! have we not the council here
 Of trees, that to all hope appear
 As sermons of the soil?

 To help our flagging faith to rise,
 Lo! have we not the high advice
 Of stars, that for all faith suffice
 As gospels of the skies?

 Sustain us, Lord! and help us climb,
 With hope and faith made strong and great,
 The rock-rough pathway of our fate,
 The care-dark way of time!
