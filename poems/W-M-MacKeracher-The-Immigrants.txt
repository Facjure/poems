From lands where old abuses sit entrenched
 And stern restriction thwarts aspiring merit,
And by gaunt men a meagre dole is wrenched
 From the unkind conditions they inherit;
From teeming cities where the ceaseless moan
 Of want is burthen to the traffic's hum,
From shrouded mills, and fields they ne'er might own,
 From servitude and blank despair, they come.

And every ship that sails across the foam,
 And every train that rushes from the sea,
And every sun that brightens heaven's dome,
 And every breeze that stirs the leafing tree,
Sings to the pilgrims a glad song of home,
 With freedom, joy and opportunity.
