 Here's to dear Ould Ireland,
Here's to the Irish lass,
 Here's to Dennis and Mike and Pat,
Here's to the sparkling glass.
 Here's to the Irish copper,
He may be green all right,
 But you bet he's Mickie on the spot
Whenever it comes to a fight.
 Here's to Robert Emmet, too,
And here's to our dear Tom Moore.
 Here's to the Irish shamrock,
Here's to the land we adore.
