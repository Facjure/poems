title: Life is Struggle
---

To wear out heart, and nerves, and brain,
And give oneself a world of pain;
Be eager, angry, fierce, and hot,
Imperious, supple God knows what,
For what�s all one to have or not;
O false, unwise, absurd, and vain!
For �tis not joy, it is not gain,
It is not in itself a bliss,
Only it is precisely this
That keeps us all alive.

To say we truly feel the pain,
And quite are sinking with the strain;
Entirely, simply, undeceived,
Believe, and say we ne�er believed
The object, e�en were it achieved,
A thing we e�er had cared to keep;
With heart and soul to hold it cheap,
And then to go and try it again;
O false, unwise, absurd, and vain!
O, �tis not joy, and �tis not bliss,
Only it is precisely this
That keeps us still alive.
