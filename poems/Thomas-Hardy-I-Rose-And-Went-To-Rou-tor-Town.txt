title: I Rose And Went To Rou'tor Town

(She, alone)



I rose and went to Rou'tor Town
 With gaiety and good heart,
 And ardour for the start,
That morning ere the moon was down
That lit me off to Rou'tor Town
 With gaiety and good heart.

When sojourn soon at Rou'tor Town
 Wrote sorrows on my face,
 I strove that none should trace
The pale and gray, once pink and brown,
When sojourn soon at Rou'tor Town
 Wrote sorrows on my face.

The evil wrought at Rou'tor Town
 On him I'd loved so true
 I cannot tell anew:
But nought can quench, but nought can drown
The evil wrought at Rou'tor Town
 On him I'd loved so true!
