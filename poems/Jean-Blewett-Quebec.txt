Quebec, the gray old city on the hill,
 Lies, with a golden glory on her head,
Dreaming throughout this hour so fair, so still,
 Of other days and her belovï¿½d dead.
The doves are nesting in the cannons grim,
 The flowers bloom where once did run a tide
Of crimson when the moon rose pale and dim
 Above a field of battle stretching wide.
Methinks within her wakes a mighty glow
 Of pride in ancient times, her stirring past,
The strife, the valor of the long ago
 Feels at her heart-strings. Strong and tall, and vast
She lies, touched with the sunset's golden grace,
A wondrous softness on her gray old face.
