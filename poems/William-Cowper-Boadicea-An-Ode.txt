title: Boadicea. An Ode.

When the British warrior queen,
Bleeding from the Roman rods,
Sought, with an indignant mien,
Counsel of her country�s gods,


Sage beneath the spreading oak
Sat the Druid, hoary chief;
Every burning word he spoke
Full of rage, and full of grief.


Princess! if our aged eyes
Weep upon thy matchless wrongs,
�Tis because resentment ties
All the terrors of our tongues.


Rome shall perish�write that word
In the blood that she has spilt;
Perish, hopeless and abhorr�d,
Deep in ruin as in guilt.


Rome, for empire far renown�d,
Tramples on a thousand states;
Soon her pride shall kiss the ground�
Hark! the Gaul is at her gates!


Other Romans shall arise,
Heedless of a soldier�s name;
Sounds, not arms, shall win the prize,
Harmony the path to fame.


Then the progeny that springs
From the forests of our land,
Arm�d with thunder, clad with wings,
Shall a wider world command.


Regions C�sar never knew
Thy posterity shall sway;
Where his eagles never flew,
None invincible as they.


Such the bard�s prophetic words,
Pregnant with celestial fire,
Bending as he swept the chords
Of his sweet but awful lyre.


She, with all a monarch�s pride,
Felt them in her bosom glow:
Rush�d to battle, fought, and died:
Dying, hurl�d them at the foe.


Ruffians, pitiless as proud,
Heaven awards the vengeance due;
Empire is on us bestow�d,
Shame and ruin wait for you.
