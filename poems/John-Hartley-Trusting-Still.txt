When shall we meet again?
One more year passed;
One more of grief and pain; - 
Maybe the last.
Are the years sending us
Farther apart?
Or love still blending us
Heart into heart?
Do love's fond memories
Brighten the way,
Or faith's fell enemies
Darken thy day?
Oh! could the word unkind
Be recalled now,
Or in the years behind
Buried lie low,
How would my heart rejoice
As round it fell,
Sweet cadence of thy voice,
Still loved so well.
Sometimes when sad it seems
Whisperings say:
"Cherish thy baseless dreams,
Yet whilst thou may,
Try not to pierce the veil,
Lest thou should'st see,
Only a dark'ning vale
Stretching for thee."
But Hope's mist-shrouded sun
Once more breaks out,
Chasing the shadows dim,
Heavy with doubt.
And far ahead I see,
Two rays entwine;
One faint, as soul of me,
One bright like thine.
And in that welcome sign,
Clearly I view,
Proof of this trust of mine, - 
Thou art still true.
