title: To Another Woman's Baby
---

I list your prattle, baby boy,
 And hear your pattering feet
With feelings more of pain than joy
 And thoughts of bitter-sweet.

While touching your soft hands in play
 Such passionate longings rise
For my wee boy who strayed away
 So soon to Paradise.

You win me with your infant art;
 But when our play is o'er,
The empty cradle in my heart
 Seems lonelier than before.

Sweet baby boy, you do not guess
 How oft mine eyes are dim,
Or that my lingering caress
 Is sometimes meant for HIM.
