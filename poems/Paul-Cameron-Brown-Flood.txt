White ermine/white semen,
green eyes jade from the night.

Eternity falls in sparrow,
an inch-worm down
a pear-coloured leg,
within this droplet
lies coiled raptures
of a snake,
anointed coils
musky as in woolen handshake
where tributaries turn into socks
wrapped to the vertebrae clasp
of a teenager's leg.

My fingers are
frying skillets
slow-boiling water, with precision,
your rivers &amp; chasms,
a vagina white knuckle rafting
across your enchantment.
