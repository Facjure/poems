Our lives evaporating as we talk,
flypaper from cosmic ceiling - 

We gather stardust,
mnemonics, perhaps,
re-arrangers of mystic twigs
into a pattern.

Look to the sky,
les nuages, l'ombre
les arbres alla primavera
"magnificio", said I
with real relish &amp;
snap of ring-encrusted fingers,
distant God, not quite Himself,
behind a podium exiting the band shell.
