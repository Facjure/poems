 I'm the ghost of that poor gobbler
Who used to be so great,
 They took my poor, neglected bones
And piled them on a plate.
 Reader, shed a kindly tear
For my unhappy fate.

 This is the common lot of all
Upon the world's great chart;
 We've got to leave a pile of bones--
The stupid and the smart.
 Even when Napoleon died
He left a Bonaparte.

 We are merely puppets
Moving on a string,
 And when we think that we are IT,
The axe will fall--"Gezing!"
 O, Grave, where is thy victory?
O, Death, where is thy sting?
