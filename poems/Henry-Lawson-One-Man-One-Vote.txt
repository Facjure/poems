�ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE!� You hear the people shouting.
The walls of Mammon tremble ere they fall.
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! Is this a time for doubting?
The poets have been prophets after all.

ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! The cry is growing stronger!
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! It echoes o�er the wave!
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! The Wealthy dead no longer
Shall rule us through their children from the grave!

ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! The knell of Retrogression!
The greatest triumph of the tongue and pen!
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! The right of long possession
Is right no longer in the minds of men!

ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! There�s lightning in the thunder!
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! The reign of Greed is o�er!
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! The cursed Vote of Plunder
Shall rule the plundered slaves of earth no more.

ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! We�re waking from our slumbers,
ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE! To rule the fields we farmed!
If thus we triumph with diminished numbers,
What will the triumph be when all are armed?
