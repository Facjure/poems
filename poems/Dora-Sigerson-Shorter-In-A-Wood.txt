 Hush, �tis thy voice!
 No, but a bird upon the bough
 Romancing to its mate, but where art thou
 To bid my heart rejoice?

 �Tis thy hand, speak!
 No, but the branches striking in the wind
 Let loose a withered leaf that falls behind
 Blown to my cheek.

 Hush, thy footfall!
 No, �tis a streamlet hidden in the fern,
 Thus from dawn to dark I wait, I learn
 Sorrow is all.
