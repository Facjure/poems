 I first saw Phebe when the show'rs
 Had just made brighter all the flow'rs;
 Yet she was fair
 As any there,
 And so I loved her hours and hours.

 Then I met Helen, and her ways
 Set my untutored heart ablaze.
 I loved at sight
 And deemed it right
 To worship her for days and days.

 Yet when I gazed on Clara's cheeks
 And spoke the language Cupid speaks,
 O'er all the rest
 She seemed the best,
 And so I loved her weeks and weeks.

 But last of Love's sweet souvenirs
 Was Delia with her sighs and tears.
 Of her it seemed
 I'd always dreamed,
 And so I loved her years and years.

 But now again with Phebe met,
 I love the first one of the set.
 "Fickle," you say?
 I answer, "Nay,
 My heart is true to one quartette."
