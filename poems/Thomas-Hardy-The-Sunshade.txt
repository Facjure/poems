Ah - it's the skeleton of a lady's sunshade,
 Here at my feet in the hard rock's chink,
 Merely a naked sheaf of wires! -
 Twenty years have gone with their livers and diers
 Since it was silked in its white or pink.

Noonshine riddles the ribs of the sunshade,
 No more a screen from the weakest ray;
 Nothing to tell us the hue of its dyes,
 Nothing but rusty bones as it lies
 In its coffin of stone, unseen till to-day.

Where is the woman who carried that sun-shade
 Up and down this seaside place? -
 Little thumb standing against its stem,
 Thoughts perhaps bent on a love-stratagem,
 Softening yet more the already soft face!

Is the fair woman who carried that sunshade
 A skeleton just as her property is,
 Laid in the chink that none may scan?
 And does she regret - if regret dust can -
 The vain things thought when she flourished this?

SWANAGE CLIFFS.
