 A few long-hoarded pennies in his hand
 Behold him stand;
 A kilted Hedonist, perplexed and sad.
 The joy that once he had,
 The first delight of ownership is fled.
 He bows his little head.
 Ah, cruel Time, to kill
 That splendid thrill!

 Then in his tear-dimmed eyes
 New lights arise.
 He drops his treasured pennies on the ground,
 They roll and bound
 And scattered, rest.
 Now with what zest
 He runs to find his errant wealth again!

 So unto men
 Doth God, depriving that He may bestow.
 Fame, health and money go,
 But that they may, new found, be newly sweet.
 Yea, at His feet
 Sit, waiting us, to their concealment bid,
 All they, our lovers, whom His Love hath hid.

 Lo, comfort blooms on pain, and peace on strife,
And gain on loss.
 What is the key to Everlasting Life?
A blood-stained Cross.
