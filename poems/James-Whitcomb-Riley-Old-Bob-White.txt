 Old Bob White's a funny bird! - 
 Funniest you ever heard! - 
Hear him whistle, - "Old - Bob - White!"
 You can hear him, clean from where
 He's 'way 'crosst the wheat-field there,
 Whistlin' like he didn't care - 
"Old-Bob-White!"


 Whistles alluz ist the same - 
 So's we won't fergit his name! - 
Hear him say it? - "Old - Bob - White!"
 There! he's whizzed off down the lane - 
 Gone back where his folks is stayin' - 
 Hear him? - There he goes again, - 
"Old - Bob - White!"

 When boys ever tries to git
 Clos't to him - how quick he'll quit
Whistlin' his "Old-Bob - White!"
 "Whoo-rhoo-rhoo!" he's up an' flew,
 Ist a-purt'-nigh skeerin' you
 Into fits! - 'At's what he'll do. - 
"Old-Bob - White!"

 Wunst our Hired Man an' me,
 When we drove to Harmony,
Saw one, whistlin' "Old - Bob - White!"
 An' we drove wite clos't, an' I
 Saw him an' he didn't fly, - 
 Birds likes horses, an' that's why.
"Old - Bob - White!"

 One time, Uncle Sidney says,
 Wunst he rob' a Bob White's nes'
Of the eggs of "Old Bob White";
 Nen he hatched 'em wiv a hen
 An' her little chicks, an' nen
 They ist all flewed off again!
"Old - Bob - White!"
