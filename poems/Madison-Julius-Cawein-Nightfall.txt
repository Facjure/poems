 O day, so sicklied o'er with night!
 O dreadful fruit of fallen dusk!
 A Circe orange, golden-bright,
 With horror 'neath its husk.

 And I, who gave the promise heed
 That made life's tempting surface fair,
 Have I not eaten to the seed
 Its ashes of despair!

 O silence of the drifted grass!
 And immemorial eloquence
 Of stars and winds and waves that pass!
 And God's indifference!

 Leave me alone with sleep that knows
 Not any thing that life may keep
 Not e'en the pulse that comes and goes
 In germs that climb and creep.

 Or if an aspiration pale
 Must quicken there, oh, let the spot
 Grow weeds! that dost may so prevail,
 Where spirit once could not!
