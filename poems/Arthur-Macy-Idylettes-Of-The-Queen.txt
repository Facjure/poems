 I. - SHE

 I fain would write on pleasant themes;
 So let me prate
 Awhile of Kate;
 And if my rhyming effort seems
 Uncouth or rough,
At any rate,
She's Kate,
 And that's enough.


 II. - HER EYES

 Her eyes are bright - 
I cannot say "like stars at night,"
 Nor can I say
"Like the Orb of Day,"
 Because such phrases are archaic.
And if I swear
That they compare
With diamonds rare,
 That's too prosaic.

 I've hunted my thesaurus through,
 "The Century" and "Webster," too,
But all in vain;
'Tis therefore plain
 That they who made these books so wise
 Had never seen her eyes!


 III. - HER GOWN

 When Kate puts on her Sunday gown
And goes to church all in her best,
 The watchful gargoyles looking down
 Relax their most forbidding frown,
And smile with kindly interest.

 Discerning gargoyles! could I be
One of your number looking down,
 With you I surely would agree
 And share your amiability
At sight of Kate and Sunday gown.


 IV. - HER KNOWLEDGE

 How much she knows no one can tell;
 But she can read and write and spell,
Divide and multiply and add,
And name the apples Thomas had
 When John enticed him five to sell.

 For "jelly" she does not say "jell,"
 Nor horrify us with "umbrell,"
For all of which we're very glad - 
 How much she knows!

 She knows the oyster by his shell,
 Detects the newsboy by his yell,
Enumerates the bones in shad,
And thinks my poetry is bad.
 Well! well! well! well! well! well! well! well!
 How much she knows!


 V. - HER SIGH

 When she utters a sigh
'Tis a breath from the roses,
 And a-hovering nigh,
 When she utters a sigh,
 The bees wonder why
No garden discloses.
 When she utters a sigh
'Tis a breath from the roses.


 VI. - HER RING

 Her ring goes round her finger.
Oh, foolish thing!
Were I a ring,
 I'd not "go round" - I'd linger!


 VII. - HER FAULTS

 Of faults she has but one,
 And that is, she has none.


 VIII. - HER VOICE

 Sweet and soothing, rhythmic, tuneful,
 Dulcet, mellow, unbassoonful,
Zither, 'cello, lute, guitar,
And there you are!


 IX. - HER LOVE

 Do you love me?
 R. S. V. P.
