title: God Sees Me Always.
---

God sees me always. When I sleep,
He kindly watches near;
He loves the little child to keep,
Who tries to please Him here.

When I'm alone He sees me too,
Though no one else is by;
And every naughty thing I do,
He sees it from on high.

He sees me, too, when I am rude,
And cry, and fret, and tease;
He loves to see me when I'm good
And try mamma to please.

Then, since He sees me day and night,
And is so kind to me,
I must do always what is right,
His gentle child must be.
