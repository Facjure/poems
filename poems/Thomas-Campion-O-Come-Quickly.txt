title: O Come Quickly!
---

Never weather-beaten sail more willing bent to shore,
Never tir�d pilgrim�s limbs affected slumber more,
Than my wearied sprite now longs to fly out of my troubled breast:
O come quickly, sweetest Lord, and take my soul to rest!

Ever blooming are the joys of heaven�s high Paradise,
Cold age deafs not there our ears nor vapour dims our eyes:
Glory there the sun outshines; whose beams the Bless�d only see:
O come quickly, glorious Lord, and raise my sprite to Thee!
