 Nor time nor all his minions
 Of sorrow or of pain,
 Shall dash with vulture pinions
 The cup she fills again
 Within the dream-dominions
 Of life where she doth reign.

 Clothed on with bright desire
 And hope that makes her strong,
 With limbs of frost and fire,
 She sits above all wrong,
 Her heart, a living lyre,
 Her love, its only song.

 And in the waking pauses
 Of weariness and care,
 And when the dark hour draws his
 Black weapon of despair,
 Above effects and causes
 We hear its music there.

 The longings life hath near it
 Of love we yearn to see;
 The dreams it doth inherit
 Of immortality;
 Are callings of her spirit
 To something yet to be.
