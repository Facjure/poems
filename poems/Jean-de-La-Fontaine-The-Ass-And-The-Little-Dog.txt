title: The Ass And The Little Dog.

[1]

 One's native talent from its course
 Cannot be turned aside by force;
 But poorly apes the country clown
 The polish'd manners of the town.
 Their Maker chooses but a few
 With power of pleasing to imbue;
 Where wisely leave it we, the mass,
 Unlike a certain fabled ass,
 That thought to gain his master's blessing
 By jumping on him and caressing.
 'What!' said the donkey in his heart;
 'Ought it to be that puppy's part
 To lead his useless life
 In full companionship
 With master and his wife,
 While I must bear the whip?
 What doth the cur a kiss to draw?
 Forsooth, he only gives his paw!
 If that is all there needs to please,
 I'll do the thing myself, with ease.'
 Possess'd with this bright notion, - 
 His master sitting on his chair,
 At leisure in the open air, - 
 He ambled up, with awkward motion,
 And put his talents to the proof;
 Upraised his bruised and batter'd hoof,
 And, with an amiable mien,
 His master patted on the chin,
 The action gracing with a word - 
 The fondest bray that e'er was heard!
 O, such caressing was there ever?
 Or melody with such a quaver?
 'Ho! Martin![2] here! a club, a club bring!'
 Out cried the master, sore offended.
 So Martin gave the ass a drubbing, - 
 And so the comedy was ended.
