 O we have loved you through cold and rain
And pitiless frost,
 Consuming our offering of blood and of brain
 Gladly again and again and again,
Though it all seemed lost,
Ireland, Ireland!

 O we will fight, fight on for you till
Your anguish is past,
 The wronged ones righted, the tyrants still. - 
 Though God has not saved you, yet we will,
At the last, at the last,
Ireland, Ireland!

 O we will love you in warmth and light
And the happy day,
 When you have forgotten the terrible night,
 Standing proud and beautiful bright
For ever and aye,
Ireland, Ireland!
