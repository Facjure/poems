Wot�s that you�re readin�? a novel? A novel! well, darn my skin!
You a man grown and bearded and histin� such stuff ez that in
Stuff about gals and their sweethearts! No wonder you�re thin ez a knife.
Look at me clar two hundred and never read one in my life!

That�s my opinion o� novels. And ez to their lyin� round here,
They belong to the Jedge�s daughter the Jedge who came up last year
On account of his lungs and the mountains and the balsam o� pine and fir;
And his daughter well, she read novels, and that�s what�s the matter with her.

Yet she was sweet on the Jedge, and stuck by him day and night,
Alone in the cabin up �yer till she grew like a ghost, all white.
She wus only a slip of a thing, ez light and ez up and away
Ez rifle smoke blown through the woods, but she wasn�t my kind no way!

Speakin� o� gals, d�ye mind that house ez you rise the hill,
A mile and a half from White�s, and jist above Mattingly�s mill?
You do? Well now thar�s a gal! What! you saw her? Oh, come now, thar! quit!
She was only bedevlin� you boys, for to me she don�t cotton one bit.

Now she�s what I call a gal ez pretty and plump ez a quail;
Teeth ez white ez a hound�s, and they�d go through a ten-penny nail;
Eyes that kin snap like a cap. So she asked to know �whar I was hid?�
She did! Oh, it�s jist like her sass, for she�s peart ez a Katydid.

But what was I talking of? Oh! the Jedge and his daughter she read
Novels the whole day long, and I reckon she read them abed;
And sometimes she read them out loud to the Jedge on the porch where he sat,
And �twas how �Lord Augustus� said this, and how �Lady Blanche� she said that.

But the sickest of all that I heerd was a yarn thet they read �bout a chap,
�Leather-stocking� by name, and a hunter chock full o� the greenest o� sap;
And they asked me to hear, but I says, �Miss Mabel, not any for me;
When I likes I kin sling my own lies, and thet chap and I shouldn�t agree.�

Yet somehow or other that gal allus said that I brought her to mind
Of folks about whom she had read, or suthin belike of thet kind,
And thar warn�t no end o� the names that she give me thet summer up here
�Robin Hood,� �Leather-stocking� �Rob Roy,� Oh, I tell you, the critter was queer!

And yet, ef she hadn�t been spiled, she was harmless enough in her way;
She could jabber in French to her dad, and they said that she knew how to play;
And she worked me that shot-pouch up thar, which the man doesn�t live ez kin use;
And slippers you see �em down �yer ez would cradle an Injin�s papoose.

Yet along o� them novels, you see, she was wastin� and mopin� away,
And then she got shy with her tongue, and at last she had nothin� to say;
And whenever I happened around, her face it was hid by a book,
And it warn�t till the day she left that she give me ez much ez a look.

And this was the way it was. It was night when I kem up here
To say to �em all �good-by,� for I reckoned to go for deer
At �sun up� the day they left. So I shook �em all round by the hand,
�Cept Mabel, and she was sick, ez they give me to understand.

But jist ez I passed the house next morning at dawn, some one,
Like a little waver o� mist got up on the hill with the sun;
Miss Mabel it was, alone all wrapped in a mantle o� lace
And she stood there straight in the road, with a touch o� the sun in her face.

And she looked me right in the eye I�d seen suthin� like it before
When I hunted a wounded doe to the edge o� the Clear Lake Shore,
And I had my knee on its neck, and I jist was raisin� my knife,
When it give me a look like that, and well, it got off with its life.

�We are going to-day,� she said, �and I thought I would say good-by
To you in your own house, Luke these woods and the bright blue sky!
You�ve always been kind to us, Luke, and papa has found you still
As good as the air he breathes, and wholesome as Laurel Tree Hill.

�And we�ll always think of you, Luke, as the thing we could not take away,
The balsam that dwells in the woods, the rainbow that lives in the spray.
And you�ll sometimes think of mE, Luke, as you know you once used to say,
A rifle smoke blown through the woods, a moment, but never to stay.�

And then we shook hands. She turned, but a-suddent she tottered and fell,
And I caught her sharp by the waist, and held her a minit. Well,
It was only a minit, you know, thet ez cold and ez white she lay
Ez a snowflake here on my breast, and then well, she melted away

And was gone. . . . And thar are her books; but I says not any for me;
Good enough may be for some, but them and I mightn�t agree.
They spiled a decent gal ez might hev made some chap a wife,
And look at me! clar two hundred and never read one in my life!
