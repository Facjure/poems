 Because of the fullness of what I had
 All that I have seems void and vain.
 If I had not been happy I were not sad;
 Though my salt is savorless, why complain?

 From the ripe perfection of what was mine,
 All that is mine seems worse than naught;
 Yet I know as I sit in the dark and pine,
 No cup could be drained which had not been fraught.

 From the throb and thrill of a day that was,
 The day that now is seems dull with gloom;
 Yet I bear its dullness and darkness because
 'Tis but the reaction of glow and bloom.

 From the royal feast which of old was spread
 I am starved on the diet which now is mine;
 Yet I could not turn hungry from water and bread,
 If I had not been sated on fruit and wine.
