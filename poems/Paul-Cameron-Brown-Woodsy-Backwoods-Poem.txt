I saw Bear
shopping with Santa Claus
at the North of 7 Plaza
only he wasn't wearing a bib - 
only a cotton-wool imitation synthetic
polystyrene white fluffy instead.

I saw the Bear
gracing a wall at the
Old Trout Lake Hotel
(part-time job),
looking self-satisfied,
smug back of the Mosque Lake Road
but a self-starter, no less,
lacking the wherewithal, nonetheless,
to be a serious shit-disturber
accolades &amp; kudos aside, still
circus Work is hard &amp;
good dancing difficult to come by,
poor dish of custard, sticky stuffed bastard.

yet the pay-off begins
when Bear gets home
with only grubs in the bank
and maggots to show
for his life's work, alas,
no fireworks for free
in the big grin as you den,
leaf-off frenzy
witch begins October
month of orange zen
zip up only can ya please.
