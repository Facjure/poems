The girl's a slender thing and fair,
 With dimpled cheek and eyes ashine;
The youth is tall, with bashful air.
 Heigho! a fond and foolish pair - 
 The day is yours, St. Valentine.

He says: "My heart will constant prove,
 Since every beat of it is thine;
The sweetest joy of life is love."
 The birds are mating in the grove - 
 The day is yours, St. Valentine.

What matter that the wind blows chill
 Through leafless tree and naked vine,
That snowdrifts linger on the hill,
 When warm love makes the pulses thrill?
 The day is yours, St. Valentine.
