Come all ye happy children, and
Gather round me hand in hand,
Dancing to the merry cry,
"See the Robbers Passing By."

Past the Castle we will dance
To the Mansion House, and prance
Back by George's Street and cry,
"See the Robbers Passing By."

Gather then ye children all
Into ranks processional,
Marching to the merry cry,
"See the Robbers Passing By."
