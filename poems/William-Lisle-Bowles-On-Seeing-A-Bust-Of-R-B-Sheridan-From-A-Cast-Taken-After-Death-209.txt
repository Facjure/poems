title: On Seeing A Bust Of R. B. Sheridan, From A Cast Taken After Death.[209]
---

 Alas, poor Sheridan! when first we met,
 'Twas 'mid a smiling circle, and thine eye,
 That flashed with eloquent hilarity
 And playful fancy, I remember yet
 Freshly as yesterday. The gay and fair,
 The young and beautiful, - now in their graves - 
 Surrounded us; while on the lucid wave
 Of Hampton's waters, to the morning air
 The streamer softly played of our light boat,
 Which seemed as on a magic sea to float.

 I saw thee after in this crowd of life,
 Conflicting, but yet blandly, with its strife.
 As the still car of Time rolled on, thy cheek
 Wore the same smile, yet with a trace more weak.
 Lone sorrow came as life declined, and care,
 And age, with slowly furrowing line, was there.

 I could have spared this fearful sight! Most strange
 Is the eventful tale of mortal change,
 Inevitable; but death, brought so nigh,
 In form so tangible, harrows the eye.
 As all the past floats like a cloud away,
 Alas, poor Sheridan! I turn and say,
 Not without feelings which such sights impart,
 Sad, but instructive, to the Christian's heart!

May 18, 1826.
