title: Fragment - Moonrise At Sea.
---

With lips that were hoarse with a fury
 Of foam and of winds that are strewn,
Of storm and of turbulent hurry,
 The ocean roared, heralding soon
A birth of miraculous glory,
 Of madness, affection - the moon.

And soon from her waist with a slipping
 And shudder and clinging of light,
With a loos'ning and pushing and ripping
 Of the raven-laced bodice of Night,
With a silence of feet and a dripping
 The goddess came, virginal white.

And the air was alive with the twinkle
 And tumult of silver-shod feet,
The hurling of stars, and the sprinkle
 Of loose, lawny limbs and a sweet
Murmur and whisper and tinkle
 Of beam-weaponed moon spirits fleet.
