"Dying?I am not dying?Are you mad?
 You think I need to ask for heavenly grace?
I think you are a fiend, who would be glad
 To see me struggle in death's cold embrace.

"But, man, you lie! for I am strong - in truth
 Stronger than I have been in years; and soon
I shall feel young again as in my youth,
 My glorious youth - life's one great priceless boon.

"O youth, youth, youth!O God! that golden time,
 When proud and glad I laughed the hours away.
Why, there's no sacrifice (perhaps no crime)
 I'd pause at, could it make me young to-day.

"But I'm not old!I grew - just ill, somehow;
 Grew stiff of limb, and weak, and dim of sight.
It was but sickness.I am better now,
 Oh, vastly better, ever since last night.

"And I could weep warm floods of happy tears
 To think my strength is coming back at last,
For I have dreamed of such an hour for years,
 As I lay thinking of my glorious past.

"You shake your head?Why, man, if you were sane
 I'd strike you to my feet, I would, in truth.
How dare you tell me that my hopes are vain?
 How dare you say I have outlived my youth?

"'In heaven I may regain it'?Oh, be still!
 I want no heaven but what my glad youth gave.
Its long, bright hours, its rapture and its thrill - 
 O youth, youth, youth! it is my youth I crave.

"There is no heaven!There's nothing but a deep
 And yawning grave from which I shrink in fear.
I am not sure of even rest or sleep;
 Perhaps we lie and think as I have here.

"Think, think, think, think, as we lie there and rot,
 And hear the young above us laugh in glee.
How dare you say I'm dying!I am not.
 I would curse God if such a thing could be.

"Why, see me stand! why, hear this strong, full breath - 
 Dare you repeat that silly, base untruth?"
A cry - a fall - the silence known as death
 Hushed his wild words.Well, has he found his youth?
