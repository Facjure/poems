I sat in heaven like the sun
 Above a storm when winter was:
 I took the snowflakes one by one
And turned their fragile shapes to glass:
I washed the rivers blue with rain
And made the meadows green again.

I took the birds and touched their springs,
 Until they sang unearthly joys:
They flew about on golden wings
 And glittered like an angel's toys:
I filled the fields with flowers' eyes,
As white as stars in Paradise.

And then I looked on man and knew
 Him still intent on death - still proud;
Whereat into a rage I flew
 And turned my body to a cloud:
In the dark shower of my soul
The star of earth was swallowed whole.
