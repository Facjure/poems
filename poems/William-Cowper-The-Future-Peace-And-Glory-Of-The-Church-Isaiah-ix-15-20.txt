title: The Future Peace And Glory Of The Church. - Isaiah ix.15-20.

Hear what God the Lord hath spoken,
�O my people, faint and few,
Comfortless, afflicted, broken,
Fair abodes I build for you;
Thorns of heart-felt tribulation
Shall no more perplex your ways:
You shall name your walls, Salvation,
And your gates shall all be praise.


�There, like streams that feed the garden,
Pleasures without end shall flow;
For the Lord, your faith rewarding,
All his bounty shall bestow;
Still in undisturb�d possession
Peace and righteousness shall reign;
Never shall you feel oppression,
Hear the voice of war again.


�Ye no more your suns descending,
Waning moons no more shall see;
But, your griefs for ever ending,
Find eternal noon in me;
God shall rise, and shining o�er you,
Change to day the gloom of night;
He, the Lord, shall be your glory,
God your everlasting light.�
