 Old Indiany, 'course we know
 Is first, and best, and most, also,
 Of all the States' whole forty-four: -
 She's first in ever'thing, that's shore! -
 And best in ever'way as yet
 Made known to man; and you kin bet
 She's most, because she won't confess
 She ever was, or will be, less!
 And yet, fer all her proud array
 Of sons, how many gits away! -

 No doubt about her bein' great,
 But, fellers, she's a leaky State!
 And them that boasts the most about
 Her, them's the ones that's dribbled out.
 Law! jes' to think of all you boys
 'Way over here in Illinoise
 A-celebratin', like ye air,
 Old Indiany, 'way back there
 In the dark ages, so to speak,
 A-prayin' for ye once a week
 And wonderin' what's a-keepin' you
 From comin', like you ort to do.
 You're all a-lookin' well, and like
 You wasn't "sidin' up the pike,"
 As the tramp-shoemaker said
 When "he sacked the boss and shed
 The blame town, to hunt fer one
 Where they didn't work fer fun!"
 Lookin' extry well, I'd say,
 Your old home so fur away. -

 Maybe, though, like the old jour.,
 Fun hain't all yer workin' fer.
 So you've found a job that pays
 Better than in them old days
 You was on The Weekly Press,
 Heppin' run things, more er less;
 Er a-learnin' telegraph-
 Operatin', with a half-
 Notion of the tinner's trade,
 Er the dusty man's that laid
 Out designs on marble and
 Hacked out little lambs by hand,
 And chewed finecut as he wrought,
 "Shapin' from his bitter thought"
 Some squshed mutterings to say, -
 "Yes, hard work, and porer pay!"
 Er you'd kind o' thought the far-
 Gazin' kuss that owned a car
 And took pictures in it, had
 Jes' the snap you wanted - bad!
 And you even wondered why
 He kep' foolin' with his sky-
 Light the same on shiny days
 As when rainin'. ('T leaked always.)

 Wondered what strange things was hid
 In there when he shet the door
 And smelt like a burnt drug store
 Next some orchard-trees, i swan!
 With whole roasted apples on!
 That's why Ade is, here of late,
 Buyin' in the dear old state, -
 So's to cut it up in plots
 Of both town and country lots.
