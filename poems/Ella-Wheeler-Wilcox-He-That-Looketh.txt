Yea, she and I have broken God's command,
 And in His sight are branded with our shame.
 And yet I do not even know her name,
Nor ever in my life have touched her hand
Or brushed her garments.But I chanced to stand
 Beside her in the throng!A sweet, swift flame
 Shot from her flesh to mine -and hers the blame
Of willing looks that fed it; aye, that fanned
The glow within me to a hungry fire.
 There was an invitation in her eyes.
 Had she met mine with coldness or surprise,
I had not plunged on headlong in the mire
Of amorous thought.The flame leaped high and higher;
 Her breath and mine pulsated into sighs,
 And soft glance melted into glance kiss-wise,
And in God's sight both yielded to desire.
