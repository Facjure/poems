[TO O. R.]


 Out from the Land of the Future, into the Land of the Past
 A comrade sails to the East, the sport of the wave and the blast.
 Oh, billow and breeze, be kind, and temper your strength to your guest,
 Kind for the sake of the friend, - for the sake of the hands he pressed.

 Oh, tenderest billow and breeze, welcome him even as we
 Would welcome if you were the friend and we were the wind and the sea!
 Welcome, protect him, and waft him westward and homeward at last
 Into the Land of the Future, out from the Land of the Past!
