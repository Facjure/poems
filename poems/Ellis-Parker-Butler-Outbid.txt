When Cupid held an auction sale,
I hastened to his mart,
For I had heard that he would sell
The blue-eyed Dora�s heart.

I brought a wealth of truest love,
The most that I could proffer,
Because, forsooth, of stocks or bonds
I had not one to offer.

When Cupid offered Dora�s heart,
I bid my whole heart�s love,
A love that reached from sea to sea
And to the sky above;

And When Sir Cupid called for more,
I bid my hands and life,
That should be hers for servitude
If she became my wife.

Then �Going! going!� Cupid cried;
The silence was intense
Until old Goldbags said, �I bid
My stocks and four per cents!�

Then Cupid cried, �Fair Dora�s heart,
That ne�er was sold before!
Does anybody raise the bid?
Will any offer more?�

�If not,� but Count Decrepit rose,
Infirm, decayed and slim;
�I hid my title!� and her heart
Was there knocked down to him.

Well! titles may be more than love!
I shall not rant nor rail;
For after all I much prefer
Some heart that�s not for sale!
