NA�Y, no� mander (2) o� use to be callin� �im Ro�, Ro�, Ro�,
Fur the dog�s sto�n-deaf, an� e�s blind, �e can naither Stan� nor go�.

But I means fur to ma�ke �is owd a�ge as �appy as iver I can,
Fur I ow�s owd Ro�ver moor nor I iver ow�d mottal man.

Thou�s rode of �is back when a babby, afoor thou was gotten too owd,
Fur �e�d fetch an� carry like owt, �e was allus as good as gowd.

Eh, but �e�d fight wi� a will when �e fowt; �e could howd (3) �is o�n,
An� Ro� as the dog as knaw�d when an� wheere to bury his boane.

An� �e kep his head hoop like a king, an� �e�d niver not down wi� �is ta�il,
Fur �e�d niver done nowt to be sha�med on, when we was i� Howlaby Da�le.

An� �e sarved me sa well when �e lived, that, Dick, when �e cooms to be de�d,
I thinks as I�d like fur to hev soom soort of a sarvice re�d.

Fur �e�s moor good sense na the Parliament man �at stans fur us �ere,
An� I�d vo�t fur �im, my o�n sen, if �e could but stan fur the Shere.

�Fa�ithful an� True��them words be i� Scriptur�an� Fa�ithful an� True
Ull be fun� (4) upo� four short legs ten times fur one upo� two.

An� ma�ybe they�ll walk upo� two but I knaws they runs upo� four, (5)�
Bedtime, Dicky! but wa�it till tha �e�rs it be strikin� the hour.

Fur I wants to tell tha o� Ro� when we lived i� Howlaby Da�le,
Ten year sin�Na�y�na�y! tha mun nobbut hev� one glass of a�le.

Stra�nge an� owd-farran�d (6) the �ouse, an� belt (7) long afoor my da�y
Wi� ha�fe o� the chimleys a-twizzen�d (8) an� twined like a band o� ha�y.

The fellers as ma�kes them picturs, �ud coom at the fall o� the year,
An� cattle their ends upo stools to pictur the door-poorch theere,

An� the Heagle �as hed two he�ds stannin� theere o� the brokken stick; (9)
An� they niver �ed seed sich ivin�s (10) as graw�d hall ower the brick;

An� theere i� the �ouse one night�but it�s down, an� all on it now
Go�n into mangles an� tonups, (11) an� ra�ved slick thruf by the plow�

Theere, when the �ouse wur a house, one night I wur sittin� alo�n,
Wi� Ro�ver athurt my fee�t, an� slee�pin still as a sto�n,

Of a Christmas E�ve, an� as cowd as this, an� the midders (12) as white,
An the fences all on �em bolster �d oop wi� the windle (13) that night;

An� the cat wur a-slee�pin alongside Ro�ver, but I wur awa�ke,
An� smo�kin� an� thinkin� o� things�Do�nt ma�ke thysen sick wi� the ca�ke.

Fur the men ater supper �ed sung their songs an� �ed �ed their beer,
An� �ed go�n their wa�ys; ther was nobbut three, an� no�n on �em theere.

They was all on �em fear�d o� the Gho�st an� dussn�t not slee�p i� the �ouse,
But Dicky, the Gho�st mo�stlins (14) was nobbut a rat or a mouse.

An� I loo�kt out wonst (15) at the night, an� the da�le was all of a thaw,
Fur I seed the beck coomin� down like a long black sna�ke i� the snaw,

An� I he�rd gre�t he�ps o� the snaw slushin� down fro� the bank to the beck,
An� then as I stood i� the doorwa�y, I fee�ld it drip o� my neck.

Saw I turn�d in age�n, an� I thowt o� the good owd times �at was goan,
An� the munney they ma�de by the war, an� the times �at was coomin� on;

Fur I thowt if the Sta�te was a gawin� to let in furriners� wheat,
Howiver was British farmers to stan� age�n o� their fee�t.

Howiver was I fur to find my rent an� to pa�y my men?
An� all along o� the feller (16) as turn�d �is back of hissen.

Thou slep i� the chaumber above us, we couldn�t ha� �eard tha call,
Sa Moother �ed tell�d ma to bring tha down, an� thy cra�dle an� all;

Fur the gell o� the farm �at slep wi� tha then �ed gotten wer le�ve,
Fur to go� that night to �er fo�lk by cause o� the Christmas E�ve;

But I cle�n forgot tha, my lad, when Moother �ell gotten to bed,
An� I slep i� my chair hup-on-end, an� the Free� Tra�de runn�d �i my �ead,

Till I dre�m�d �at Squire walkt in, an� I says to him �Squire, ya�re la�te,�
Then I seed at �is fa�ce wur as red as the Yule-block theer i� the gra�te.

An� �e says �can ya pa�y me the rent to-night?� an� I says to �im �No�,�
An� �e cotch�d howd hard o� my hairm, (17) �Then hout to-night tha shall go�.�

�Tha�ll niver,� says I, �be a-turnin ma hout upo� Christmas E�ve�?
Then I wa�ked an� I fun it was Ro�ver a-tuggin� an� tearin� my slie�ve.

An� I thowt as �e�d go�n cle�n-wud, (18) fur I no�wa�ys knaw�d �is intent;
An� I says �Git awa�y, ya be�st,� an� I fetcht �im a kick an� �e went.

Then �e tummled up stairs, fur I �e�rd �im, as if �e�d �a brokken �is neck,
An� I�d cle�r forgot, little Dicky, thy chaumber door wouldn�t sneck; (19)

An� I slep� i� my chair age�n wi� my hairm hingin� down to the floor,
An� I thowt it was Ro�ver a-tuggin� an� tearin� me wuss nor afoor,

An� I thowt �at I kick�d �im age�n, but I kick�d thy Moother istead.
�What arta snorin� theere fur? the house is afire,� she said.

Thy Moother �ed be�n a-naggin� about the gell o� the farm,
She offens �ud spy summut wrong when there warn�t not a mossel o� harm;

An� she didn�t not solidly me�n I wur gawin� that wa�y to the bad,
Fur the gell (20) a was as howry a trollope as iver tra�pes�d i� the squad.

But Moother was free of �er tongue, as I offens �ev tell�d �er mysen,
Sa I kep i� my chair, fur I thowt she was nobbut a-rilin� ma then.

An� I says � I�d be good to tha, Bess, if tha�d onywa�ys let ma be good,�
But she skelpt ma ha�fe ower i� the chair, an� scree�d like a Howl gone wud (21)�

�Ya mun run fur the lether. (22) Git oop, if ya�re onywa�ys good for owt.�
And I says �If I be�nt no�wa�ys�not nowada�ys�good fur nowt�

Yit I be�nt sich a Nowt (23) of all Nowts as �ull hallus do as �e�s bid.�
�But the stairs is afire,� she said; then I seed �er a-cryin�, I did.

An� she be�ld �Ya mun sa�ve little Dick, an� be sharp about it an� all,�
Sa I runs to the yard fur a lether, an� sets �im age�n the wall,

An� I claums an� I mashes the winder hin, when I gits to the top,
But the heat druv hout i� my heyes till I fe�ld mysen ready to drop.

Thy Moother was howdin� the lether, an� tellin� me not to be ske�rd,
An� I wasn�t afe�rd, or I thinks le�st-wa�ys as I wasn�t afe�rd;

But I couldn�t see fur the smo�ke wheere thou was a-liggin, my lad,
An� Ro�ver was theere i� the chaumber a-yowlin� an� yaupin� like mad;

An� thou was a-be�lin� likewise, an� a-sque�lin�, as if tha was bit,
An� it wasn�t a bite but a burn, fur the merk�s (24) o� thy shou�der yit;

Then I call�d out Ro�, Ro�, Ro�, thaw I didn�t ha�fe think as �e�d �ear,
But �e coom�d thruf the fire wi my bairn i� �is mouth to the winder theere!

He coom�d like a Hangel o� marcy as soon as �e �eard �is na�me,
Or like tother Hangel i� Scriptur �at summun seed i� the fla�me,

When summun �ed hax�d fur a son, an� �e promised a son to she,
An� Ro� was as good as the Hangel i� sa�vin� a son fur me.

Sa I browt tha down, an� I says �I mun gaw up agean fur Ro�.�
�Gaw up age�n fur the varmint?� I tell�d �er �Ye�s I mun go�.�

An� I claumb�d up age�n to the winder, an� clemm�d (25) owd Ro� by the �e�d,
An� �is �air coom�d off i� my �ands an� I ta�ked �im at fust fur dead;

Fur �e smell�d like a herse a-singein�, an� see�m�d as blind as a poop,
An� ha�fe on �im bare as a bublin�. (26) I couldn�t wakken �im oop,

But I browt �im down, an� we got to the barn, fur the barn wouldn�t burn
Wi� the wind blawin� hard tother wa�y, an� the wind wasn�t like to turn.

An� I kep a-callin� o� Ro� till �e waggled �is ta�il fur a bit,
But the cocks kep a-crawin� an� crawin� all night, an� I �ears �em yit;

An� the dogs was a-yowlin� all round, and thou was a-sque�lin� thysen,
An� Moother was naggin� an� gro�nin� an mo�nin� an� naggin� age�n;

An� I �e�rd the bricks an� the baulks (27) rummle down when the roof gev wa�y,
Fur the fire was a-ra�gin� an� ra�vin� an� ro�rin� like judgment da�y.

Warm enew theere sewer-ly, but the barn was as cowd as owt,
An� we cuddled and huddled togither, an� happt (28) wersens oop as we mowt.

An� I browt Ro� round, but Moother �ed be�n sa so�k�d wi� the thaw
�At she cotch�d �er death o� cowd that night, poor soul, i� the straw.

Ha�fe o� the parish runn�d oop when the rigtree (29) was tummlin� in�
Too la�te�but it�s all ower now�hall hower�an� ten year sin;

Too la�te, tha mun git tha to bed, but I�ll coom an� I�ll squench the light,
Fur we mo�nt �ev naw moor fires�and soa little Dick, good-night.
