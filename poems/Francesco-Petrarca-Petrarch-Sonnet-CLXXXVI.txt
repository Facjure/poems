Liete e pensose, accompagnate e sole.

NOT FINDING HER WITH HER FRIENDS, HE ASKS THEM WHY SHE IS ABSENT.


P. Pensive and glad, accompanied, alone,
 Ladies who cheat the time with converse gay,
 Where does my life, where does my death delay?
 Why not with you her form, as usual, shown?
L. Glad are we her rare lustre to have known,
 And sad from her dear company to stay,
 Which jealousy and envy keep away
 O'er other's bliss, as their own ill who moan.
P. Who lovers can restrain, or give them law?
L. No one the soul, harshness and rage the frame;
 As erst in us, this now in her appears.
 As oft the face, betrays the heart, we saw
 Clouds that, obscuring her high beauty, came,
 And in her eyes the dewy trace of tears.

MACGREGOR.
