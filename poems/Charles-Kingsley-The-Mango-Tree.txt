He wiled me through the furzy croft;
 He wiled me down the sandy lane.
He told his boy's love, soft and oft,
 Until I told him mine again.

We married, and we sailed the main;
 A soldier, and a soldier's wife.
We marched through many a burning plain;
 We sighed for many a gallant life.

But his - God kept it safe from harm.
 He toiled, and dared, and earned command;
And those three stripes upon his arm
 Were more to me than gold or land.

Sure he would win some great renown:
 Our lives were strong, our hearts were high.
One night the fever struck him down.
 I sat, and stared, and saw him die.

I had his children - one, two, three.
 One week I had them, blithe and sound.
The next - beneath this mango-tree,
 By him in barrack burying-ground.

I sit beneath the mango-shade;
 I live my five years' life all o'er - 
Round yonder stems his children played;
 He mounted guard at yonder door.

'Tis I, not they, am gone and dead.
 They live; they know; they feel; they see.
Their spirits light the golden shade
 Beneath the giant mango-tree.

All things, save I, are full of life:
 The minas, pluming velvet breasts;
The monkeys, in their foolish strife;
 The swooping hawks, the swinging nests;

The lizards basking on the soil,
 The butterflies who sun their wings;
The bees about their household toil,
 They live, they love, the blissful things.

Each tender purple mango-shoot,
 That folds and droops so bashful down;
It lives; it sucks some hidden root;
 It rears at last a broad green crown.

It blossoms; and the children cry - 
 'Watch when the mango-apples fall.'
It lives:but rootless, fruitless, I - 
 I breathe and dream; - and that is all.

Thus am I dead:yet cannot die:
 But still within my foolish brain
There hangs a pale blue evening sky;
 A furzy croft; a sandy lane.

1870.
