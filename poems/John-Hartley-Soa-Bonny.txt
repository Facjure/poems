Aw've travell'd o'er land, an aw've travell'd o'er sea,
An aw've seen th' grandest lasses 'at ivver can be;
But aw've nivver met one 'at could mak mi heart glad,
Like her, - for oh! shoo wor bonny mi lad.

Shoo wornt too gooid, for her temper wor hot,
An when her tongue started, shoo wag'd it a lot;
An it worn't all pleasant, an some on it bad,
But oh! shoo wor bonny! - soa bonny mi lad.

Consaited and cocky, an full o' what's nowt,
An shoo'd say nasty things withaat ivver a thowt;
An shood try ivvery way, just to mak me get mad; - -
For shoo knew shoo wor bonny, - soa bonny mi lad.

Fowk called me a fooil to keep hingin araand,
But whear shoo'd once stept aw could worship the graand;
For th' seet ov her face cheer'd mi heart when 'twor sad,
For shoo wor soa bonny, - soa bonny mi lad.

But shoo wor like th' rest, - false, - false in her heart;
Shoo made me to love her, - an Cupid's sharp dart
Wor nobbut her fun, - wi' decait it wor clad; - 
But then, shoo wor bonny; - soa bonny mi lad.

Shoo sooin wed another, - noa better nor me,
An aw hooap shoo'll be happy, though my life is dree;
An aw'll try to submit, though shoo treated me bad,
But oh! mi poor heart is nigh brokken mi lad.

Ther may come a time when her passion has cooiled,
Shoo may think ov a chap shoo unfeelingly fooiled;
Shoo may seek me agean; - if shoo does, - well, by gad!
Aw'll welcome her back. Shoo's soa bonny mi lad.
