Whither, O, my sweet mistress, must I follow thee?
 For when I hear thy distant footfall nearing,
 And wait on thy appearing,
Lo! my lips are silent: no words come to me.

Once I waylaid thee in green forest covers,
 Hoping that spring might free my lips with gentle fingers;
 Alas! her presence lingers
No longer than on the plain the shadow of brown kestrel hovers.

Through windless ways of the night my spirit followed after;
 Cold and remote were they, and there, possessed
 By a strange unworldly rest,
Awaiting thy still voice heard only starry laughter.

The pillared halls of sleep echoed my ghostly tread.
 Yet when their secret chambers I essayed
 My spirit sank, dismayed,
Waking in fear to find the new-born vision fled.

Once indeed - but then my spirit bloomed in leafy rapture -
 I loved; and once I looked death in the eyes:
 So, suddenly made wise,
Spoke of such beauty as I may never recapture....

Whither, O, divine mistress, must I then follow thee?
 Is it only in love ... say, is it only in death
 That the spirit blossometh,
And words that may match my vision shall come to me?
