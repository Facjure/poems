In youth, Death was
a puny boy possessing but
wormy hands &amp; fleshless fingers
as in Witch Hazel
or Scrooge's Future Ghost
 - that insipid Evil One
Hansel so easily outwitted
in a gingerbread house.

Time brought increased notoriety.
Saucy times with a soup�on of respect
for the artful dodger.
Givens change, an armful of
orange lilies, limp &amp; loathsome,
on a tombstone door
before trumpets of rain.

Graven images. Lifeless stone.
Death became stone.
Stone empty. The maggot emptiness
burrowing into chiselled easel and
the stone-cutter's savage magic.
Just a bitty stone
to herald a passing.

Night-jars.
Old straw-chairs with
a broom pronouncing
the wall base with its touch empty,
the empress of bandages
leaning to rags

On table scraps,
sorry gloom of an old building
by a pickled lake
leaking into ebb twilight.

The coronation of the nightmare,
the moon with her billowing robes and withered spoon
unfolding midstream ...
la cauchemar ou
d�nud�e soir�e
to discover, with wonder, ices with sherbet
reek like nightsweats;
a windsail of pooled light
thru puddles of trees.

Brackish backwater - 
thoughts of black ice
and huddled masses of silver
breaking thru the sun's
winter curtain as erupting coins.
