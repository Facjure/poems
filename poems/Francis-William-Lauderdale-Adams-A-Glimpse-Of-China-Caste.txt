title: A Glimpse Of China. "Caste."

 These Chinese toil and yet they do not starve,
And they obey, and yet they are not slaves.
 It is the "free-born" fuddled Englishmen
That grovel rotting in their living graves.

 These Chinese do not fawn with servile lips;
They lift up equal eyes that ask and scan.
 Their degradation has escaped at least
That choicest curse of all - the gentleman!
