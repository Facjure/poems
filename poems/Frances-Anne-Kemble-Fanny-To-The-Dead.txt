On the lone waters' shore
 Wander I yet;
Brooding those moments o'er
 I should forget.
'Till the broad foaming surge
 Warns me to fly,
While despair's whispers urge
 To stay and die.
When the night's solemn watch
 Falls on the seas,
'Tis thy voice that I catch
 In the low breeze;
When the moon sheds her light
 On things below,
Beams not her ray so bright,
 Like thy young brow?
Spirit immortal! say,
 When wilt thou come,
To marshal me the way
 To my long home?
