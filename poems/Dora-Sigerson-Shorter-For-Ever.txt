 He heard it first upon the lips of love,
And loved it for love�s sake;
 A faithful word, that knows nor time nor change,
Nor lone heart-break.

 It sung across his heart-strings like a breath
Of Heaven�s faithfulness, that whispered �Never
 To part, to lose, to linger from your gaze.�
She said, �I love for ever.�

 He heard it then upon the lips of death,
Of things that fade and die;
 A word of sorrow never to be stilled,
An ever echoing sigh.

 And loneliness within his soul did dwell,
And struck upon his heart-strings, crying �Never
 To meet, to have, to hold, to see again.�
She said, �Good-bye for ever.�
