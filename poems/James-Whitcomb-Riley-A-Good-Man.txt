I

A good man never dies -
 In worthy deed and prayer
And helpful hands, and honest eyes,
 If smiles or tears be there:
Who lives for you and me -
 Lives for the world he tries
To help - he lives eternally.
 A good man never dies.


II

Who lives to bravely take
 His share of toil and stress,
And, for his weaker fellows' sake,
 Makes every burden less, -
He may, at last, seem worn -
 Lie fallen - hands and eyes
Folded - yet, though we mourn and mourn,
 A good man never dies.
