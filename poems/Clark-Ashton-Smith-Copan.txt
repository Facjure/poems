Around its walls the forests of the west
 Gloom, as about some mystery's final pale
 Might lie its multifold exterior veil.
Sculptured with signs and meanings unconfessed,
Its lordly fanes and palaces attest
 A past before whose wall of darkness fail
 Reason and fancy, finding not the tale
Erased by time from history's palimpsest.

Within this place, that from the gloom of Eld
 Still meets the light, a people came and went
Like whirls of dust between its columns blown -
An alien race, whose record, shadow-held,
 Is sealed with those of others long forespent
That died in sunless planets lost and lone.
