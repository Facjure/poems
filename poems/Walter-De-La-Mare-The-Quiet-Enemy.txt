 Hearken! now the hermit bee
 Drones a quiet threnody;
 Greening on the stagnant pool
 The criss-cross light is beautiful;
 In the venomed yew tree wings
 Preen and flit. The linnet sings.

 Gradually the brave sun
 Sinks to a day's journey done;
 In the marshy flats abide
 Mists to muffle midnight-tide.
 Puffed within the belfry tower
 Hungry owls drowse out their hour....

 Walk in beauty. Vaunt thy rose.
 Flaunt thy poisonous loveliness!
 Pace for pace with thee there goes
 A shape that hath not come to bless.
 I, thine enemy?... Nay, nay!
 I can only watch, and wait
 Patient treacherous time away,
 Hold ajar the wicket gate.
