 Hark! like the sea in wrath the heavens assailing,
 Or like a brook through rocky basin wailing,
 Comes from below, in groaning agony,
 A heavy, vacant torment-breathing sigh!
 Their faces marks of bitter torture wear,
 While from their lips burst curses of despair;
 Their eyes are hollow, and full of woe,
And their looks with heartfelt anguish
 Seek Cocytus' stream that runs wailing below,
For the bridge o'er its waters they languish.

 And they say to each other in accents of fear,
 "Oh, when will the time of fulfilment appear?"
 High over them boundless eternity quivers,
 And the scythe of Saturnus all-ruthlessly, shivers!
