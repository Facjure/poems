Hark! I hear the tramp of thousands,
And of armed men the hum;
Lo! a nation�s hosts have gathered
Round the quick alarming drum,
Saying, �Come,
Freemen, come!
Ere your heritage be wasted,� said the quick alarming drum.

�Let me of my heart take counsel:
War is not of life the sum;
Who shall stay and reap the harvest
When the autumn days shall come?�
But the drum
Echoed, �Come!
Death shall reap the braver harvest,� said the solemn-sounding drum.

�But when won the coming battle,
What of profit springs therefrom?
What if conquest, subjugation,
Even greater ills become?�
But the drum
Answered, �Come!
You must do the sum to prove it,� said the Yankee answering drum.

�What if, �mid the cannons� thunder,
Whistling shot and bursting bomb,
When my brothers fall around me,
Should my heart grow cold and numb?�
But the drum
Answered, �Come!
Better there in death united, than in life a recreant. Come!�

Thus they answered, hoping, fearing,
Some in faith, and doubting some,
Till a trumpet-voice proclaiming,
Said, �My chosen people, come!�
Then the drum,
Lo! was dumb,
For the great heart of the nation, throbbing, answered, �Lord, we come!�
