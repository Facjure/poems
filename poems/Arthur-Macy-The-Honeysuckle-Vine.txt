title: The Honeysuckle Vine

 'Twas a tender little honeysuckle vine
 That smiled and danced in the warm sunshine,
 And spied a maid as fair as all maids be,
 Who said, "Little honeysuckle, come up to me."
 So it climbed and climbed in the sun and the shade,
 And all summer long at her window stayed;
 For that is the way that honeysuckles go,
 And that is the way that true loves grow.

 Then the loving little honeysuckle vine
 Kissed the little maid in the warm sunshine;
 But the winter came with an angry frown,
 And the false little maid shut the window down;
 And the sorrowing vine on the wintry side
 Mourned and mourned for the love that died,
 And faded away in the wind and snow, - 
 And that is the way that some loves go.
