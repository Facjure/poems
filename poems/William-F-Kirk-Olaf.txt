Yust two years ago last venter
 Ay meet Olaf op in camp;
Ve ban lumberyacks togedder.
 Every morning we skol tramp
'Bout sax miles yust after breakfast
 Till we come to big pine-trees;
Den our straw boss he skol make us
 Vork lak little busy bees.

Olaf, he ban yolly faller,
 He skol taling yoke all day;
Sometimes he sing dis har ragtime,
 Yust to passing time avay.
And at night, ven we ban smoking
 After supper, he skol make
All us lumberyacks to laughing
 Till our belts skol nearly break.

Me and Olaf bunked together,
 And sometimes he taling me
'Bout his vife and little Torger,
 Who ban living cross big sea.
"Ay ban saving dough," say Olaf;
 "And next summer, ef ay can,
Ay skol send for vife and baby;
 Den ay ban a happy man!"

One night Olaf getting letter
 Ven we coming back to camp;
He yust tal me, "Little Torger,"
 And his eyes ban gude and damp.
Dis ban how ay know vy Olaf
 Never taling no more yoke, - 
Vy he yust sit down at night-time,
 Close by me, var he skol smoke.
