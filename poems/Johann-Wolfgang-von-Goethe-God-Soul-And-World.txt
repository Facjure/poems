title: God, Soul, And World.

Who trusts in God,
Fears not His rod.
 -
This truth may be by all believed:
Whom God deceives, is well deceived.
 -
How? when? and where? No answer comes from high;
Thou wait'st for the Because, and yet thou ask'st not Why?
 -
If the whole is ever to gladden thee,
That whole in the smallest thing thou must see.
 -
Water its living strength first shows,
When obstacles its course oppose.
 -
Transparent appears the radiant air,
Though steel and stone in its breast it may bear;
At length they'll meet with fiery power,
And metal and stones on the earth will shower.

Whate'er a living flame may surround,
No longer is shapeless, or earthly bound.
'Tis now invisible, flies from earth,
And hastens on high to the place of its birth.
