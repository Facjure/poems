 "Teach me the wisdom of thy beauty, pray,
That, being thus wise, I may aspire to see
 What beauty is, whence, why, and in what way
Immortal, yet how mortal utterly:
 For, shrinking loveliness, thy brow of day
Pleads plaintive as a prayer, anemone.

 "Teach me wood-wisdom, I am petulant:
Thou hast the wildness of a Dryad's eyes,
 The shyness of an Oread's, wild plant: - 
Behold the bashful goddess where she lies
 Distinctly delicate! - inhabitant
Ambrosial-earthed, star-cousin of the skies.

 "Teach me thy wisdom, for, thro' knowing, yet,
When I have drunk dull Lethe till each vein
 Thuds full oblivion, I shall not forget; - 
For beauty known is beauty; to sustain
 Glad memories with life, while mad regret
And sorrow perish, being Lethe slain."

 "Teach thee my beauty being beautiful
And beauty wise? - My slight perfections, whole
 As world, as man, in their creation full
As old a Power's cogitation roll.
 Teach thee? - Presumption! thought is young and dull - 
Question thy God what God is, soul what soul."
