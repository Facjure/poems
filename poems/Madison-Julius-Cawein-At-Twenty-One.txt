 The rosy hills of her high breasts,
 Whereon, like misty morning, rests
 The breathing lace; her auburn hair,
 Wherein, a star point sparkling there,
 One jewel burns; her eyes, that keep
 Recorded dreams of song and sleep;
 Her mouth, with whose comparison
 The richest rose were poor and wan;
 Her throat, her form - what masterpiece
 Of man can picture half of these!
 She comes! a classic from the hand
 Of God! wherethrough I understand
 What Nature means and Art and Love,
 And all the lovely Myths thereof.
