Hi and whoop-hooray, boys!
 Sing a song of cheer!
Here's a holiday, boys,
 Lasting half a year!
Round the world, and half is
 Shadow we have tried;
Now we're where the laugh is, -
 On the sunny side!

Pigeons coo and mutter,
 Strutting high aloof
Where the sunbeans flutter
 Through the stable roof.
Hear the chickens cheep, boys,
 And the hen with pride
Clucking them to sleep, boys,
 On the sunny side!

Hear the clacking guinea;
 Hear the cattle moo;
Hear the horses whinny,
 Looking out at you!
On the hitching-block, boys,
 Grandly satisfied,
See the old peacock, boys,
 On the sunny side!

Robins in the peach-tree;
 Bluebirds in the pear;
Blossoms over each tree
 In the orchard there!
All the world's in joy, boys,
 Glad and glorified
As a romping boy, boys,
 On the sunny side!

Where's a heart as mellow?
 Where's a soul as free?
Where is any fellow
 We would rather be?
Just ourselves or none, boys,
 World around and wide,
Laughing in the sun, boys,
 On the sunny side!
