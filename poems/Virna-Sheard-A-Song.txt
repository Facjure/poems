0 heart of mine - if I were but a swallow - 
 A thing so fearless, swift of flight, and free - 
On wings unwearied I would find and follow
 Some path that led to thee!

Were I a rose out in the garden growing
 My sweetness I would give the vagrant breeze
For he, perchance, might meet thee all unknowing - 
 Yet bring thee memories.
