TO LITTLE M. E. C. G.


 Deep in baby Mary's eyes,
 Baby Mary's sweet blue eyes,
 Dwell the golden memories
 Of the music once her ears
 Heard in far-off Paradise;
 So she has no time for tears, 
 Baby Mary, 
 Listening to the songs she hears.

 Soft in baby Mary's face,
 Baby Mary's lovely face,
 If you watch, you, too, may trace
 Dreams her spirit-self hath seen
 In some far-off Eden-place,
 Whence her soul she can not wean, 
 Baby Mary, 
 Dreaming in a world between.
