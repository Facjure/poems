title: To The Beloved Dead--A Lament
---

Beloved, thou art like a tune that idle fingers
 Play on a window-pane.
The time is there, the form of music lingers;
 But O thou sweetest strain,
Where is thy soul?Thou liest i' the wind and rain.

Even as to him who plays that idle air,
 It seems a melody,
For his own soul is full of it, so, my Fair,
 Dead, thou dost live in me,
And all this lonely soul is full of thee.

Thou song of songs!--not music as before
 Unto the outward ear;
My spirit sings thee inly evermore,
 Thy falls with tear on tear.
I fail for thee, thou art too sweet, too dear.

Thou silent song, thou ever voiceless rhyme,
 Is there no pulse to move thee,
At windy dawn, with a wild heart beating time,
 And falling tears above thee,
O music stifled from the ears that love thee?

Oh, for a strain of thee from outer air!
 Soul wearies soul, I find.
Of thee, thee, thee, I am mournfully aware,
 --Contained in one poor mind,
Who wert in tune and time to every wind.

Poor grave, poor lost beloved! but I burn
 For some more vast To be.
As he that played that secret tune may turn
 And strike it on a lyre triumphantly,
I wait some future, all a lyre for thee.
