God, we thank Thee for the dower
Thou gavest Norway in his power,
 Whom in the grave we now shall lay!
Starlit paths of thoughts that awe us
His spirit found; his deeds now draw us
 To deeds, as mighty magnets play.
He was the first to stand
A light in our free land;
 Of our present the first fair crown,
The first renown,
 At Norway's feet he laid it down.

We his shining honors sharing,
And humble now his body bearing,
 Shall sing with all the world our praise.
God, who ever guides our nation,
Hath called us to a high vocation
 And shown where He our goal doth raise.
People of Norway, glad
Go on, as God us bade!
God has roused you; He knows whereto,
Though we are few.
With Him our future we shall view.
