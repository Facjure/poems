My Mary, O my Mary!
 The simmer-skies are blue;
The dawnin' brings the dazzle,
 An' the gloamin' brings the dew, -
The mirk o' nicht the glory
 O' the moon, an' kindles, too,
The stars that shift aboon the lift. -
 But nae thing brings me you!

Where is it, O my Mary,
 Ye are biding a' the while?
I ha' wended by your window -
 I ha' waited by the stile,
An' up an' down the river
 I ha' won for mony a mile,
Yet never found, adrift or drown'd,
 Your lang-belated smile.

Is it forgot, my Mary,
 How glad we used to be? -
The simmer-time when bonny bloomed
 The auld trysting-tree, -
How there I carved the name for you,
 An' you the name for me;
An' the gloamin' kenned it only
 When we kissed sae tenderly.

Speek ance to me, my Mary! -
 But whisper in my ear
As light as ony sleeper's breath,
 An' a' my soul will hear;
My heart shall stap its beating
 An' the soughing atmosphere
Be hushed the while I leaning smile
 An' listen to you, dear!

My Mary, O my Mary!
 The blossoms bring the bees;
The sunshine brings the blossoms,
 An' the leaves on a' the trees;
The simmer brings the sunshine
 An' the fragrance o' the breeze, -
But O wi'out you, Mary,
 I care nae thing for these!

We were sae happy, Mary!
 O think how ance we said -
Wad ane o' us gae fickle,
 Or ane o' us lie dead, -
To feel anither's kisses
 We wad feign the auld instead,
An' ken the ither's footsteps
 In the green grass owerhead.

My Mary, O my Mary!
 Are ye daughter o' the air,
That ye vanish aye before me
 As I follow everywhere? -
Or is it ye are only
 But a mortal, wan wi' care? -
Syne I search through a' the kirkyird
 An' I dinna find ye there!
