title: To The Soldiers Of Pius Ninth.

Warriors true, 'tis no false glory
For which now you peril life, - 
For no worthless aim unholy,
Do ye plunge into the strife;
No unstable, fleeting vision
Bright before your gaze hath shone,
No day dream of wild ambition,
Now your footsteps urges on:

But a cause both great and glorious,
Worthy of a Christian's might,
One which yet shall be victorious, - 
'Tis the cause of God and right:
Men! by aim more pure and holy
Say, could soldiers be enticed?
Strike for truth and conscience solely,
Strike for Pius and for Christ.

Even like the brave Crusaders - 
Heroes true and tried of old,
You would check the rash invaders
Of all that we sacred hold.
And though hosts your steps beleaguer,
Full of might and martial pride;
For the conflict be you eager - 
God Himself will be your guide!

Soldiers of the Cross, remember
In the cause you fight for now,
'Tis not earthly wreaths you gather
To adorn the dauntless brow;
But the laurels bright - unfading,
Never from you to be riven - 
Which will yet your brows be shading
In the shining courts of Heaven.
