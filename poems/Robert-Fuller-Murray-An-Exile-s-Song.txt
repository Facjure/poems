My soul is like a prisoned lark,
 That sings and dreams of liberty,
The nights are long, the days are dark,
 Away from home, away from thee!

My only joy is in my dreams,
 When I thy loving face can see.
How dreary the awakening seems,
 Away from home, away from thee!

At dawn I hasten to the shore,
 To gaze across the sparkling sea--
The sea is bright to me no more,
 Which parts me from my home and thee.

At twilight, when the air grows chill,
 And cold and leaden is the sea,
My tears like bitter dews distil,
 Away from home, away from thee.

I could not live, did I not know
 That thou art ever true to me,
I could not bear a doubtful woe,
 Away from home, away from thee.

I could not live, did I not hear
 A voice that sings the day to be,
When hitherward a ship shall steer,
 To bear me back to home and thee.

Oh, when at last that day shall break
 In sunshine on the dancing sea,
It will be brighter for the sake
 Of my return to home and thee!
