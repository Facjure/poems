title: A Dirge
---

Death and a dirge at midnight;
 Yet never a soul in the house
Heard anything more than the throb and beat
 Of a beautiful waltz of Strauss.

Dead, dead, dead, and staring,
 With a ghastly smile on its face;
But the world saw only laughing eyes
 And roses, and billows of lace.

Floating and whirling together,
 Into the beautiful night,
How little you dreamed of the ghastly thing
 I was hiding away from your sight.

Meeting your dark eyes' splendour,
 Feeling your warm, sweet breath,
How could you know that my passionate heart
 Had died a horrible death?

Died in its fever and fervour,
 Died in its beautiful bloom;
And that waltz of Strauss was a funeral dirge,
 Leading the way to the tomb.

But you held my hand at parting,
 And I smiled back a gay good night;
And you never knew of the ghastly corpse
 I was hiding away from your sight.

Yet whenever I hear the Danube -
 Under its pulsing strain,
I catch the wail of the funeral dirge,
 And my heart dies over again.
