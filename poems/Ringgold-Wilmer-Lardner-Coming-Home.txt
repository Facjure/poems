title: Coming Home
---

Prepare for noise, you quiet walls!
You floors, get set for heavy falls!
 Frail dishes, hide away!
Get ready for some scratches, stairs!
Clean table linen, say your prayers!
 The kid comes home today!

For three long weeks you've been, O House,
As noiseless as the well-known mouse,
 As silent as the tomb.
And you've stayed neat, with none on hand
To track your floors with mud and sand,
 To muss your ev'ry room.

The ideal place for work you've been,
But soon a Bedlam once again,
 A mess, a wreck. But say,
I wonder will it make us mad.
No, House, I'll bet we both are glad
 The kid comes home today.
