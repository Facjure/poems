title: On Hearing Mrs. Woodhouse Play The Harpsichord
---

We poets pride ourselves on what
 We feel, and not what we achieve;
The world may call our children fools,
 Enough for us that we conceive.
A little wren that loves the grass
Can be as proud as any lark
 That tumbles in a cloudless sky,
Up near the sun, till he becomes
 The apple of that shining eye.

So, lady, I would never dare
 To hear your music ev'ry day;
With those great bursts that send my nerves
 In waves to pound my heart away;
And those small notes that run like mice
Bewitched by light; else on those keys -
 My tombs of song - you should engrave:
'My music, stronger than his own,
 Has made this poet my dumb slave.'
