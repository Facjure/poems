From Lapland to the land of Tamerlane,
 Kamchatka to the confines of the Turk,
The spirit tyrants never can restrain
 When once awake is mightily at work.
Liberty, frantic with a fearful hope,
 Out of long darkness suddenly arisen,
Maddens the dull half-human herds who grope
 And rend the bars of their ancestral prison.

Over the wan lone steppe her couriers speed,
 The secret forest echoes her command,
She smites the sword that made her children bleed,
 And Death and Havoc hold the famished land.
But God overrules, and oft man's greatest good
Is won through nights of dread and days of blood.
