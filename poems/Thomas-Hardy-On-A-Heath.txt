title: On A Heath
---

I could hear a gown-skirt rustling
 Before I could see her shape,
Rustling through the heather
 That wove the common's drape,
On that evening of dark weather
 When I hearkened, lips agape.

And the town-shine in the distance
 Did but baffle here the sight,
And then a voice flew forward:
 Dear, is't you? I fear the night!"
And the herons flapped to norward
 In the firs upon my right.

There was another looming
 Whose life we did not see;
There was one stilly blooming
 Full nigh to where walked we;
There was a shade entombing
 All that was bright of me.
