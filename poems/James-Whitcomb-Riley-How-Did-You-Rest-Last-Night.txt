title: How Did You Rest, Last Night?
---

"How did you rest, last night?" -
 I've heard my gran'pap say
Them words a thousand times - that's right -
 Jes them words thataway!
As punctchul-like as morning dast
 To ever heave in sight
Gran'pap 'ud allus haf to ast -
 "How did you rest, last night?"

Us young-uns used to grin,
 At breakfast, on the sly,
And mock the wobble of his chin
 And eyebrows belt so high
And kind: "How did you rest, last night?"
 We'd mumble and let on
Our voices trimbled, and our sight
 Was dim, and hearin' gone.

*****

Bad as I used to be,
 All I'm a-wantin' is
As puore and ca'm a sleep fer me
 And sweet a sleep as his!
And so I pray, on Jedgment Day
 To wake, and with its light
See his face dawn, and hear him say -
 "How did you rest, last night?"
