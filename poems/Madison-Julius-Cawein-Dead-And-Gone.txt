I

 I wot well o' his going
To think in flowers fair; - 
 His a right kind heart, my dear,
To give the grass such hair.


II.

 I wot well o' his lying
Such nights out in the cold, - 
 To list the cricket's crick, my sweet,
To see the glow-worm's gold.


III.

 An mine eyes be laughterful,
Well may they laugh, I trow, - 
 Since two dead eyes a yesternight
Gazed in them sad enow.


IV.

 An my heart make moan and ache,
Well may it dree, I'm sure; - 
 He is dead and gone, my love,
And it is beggar poor.
