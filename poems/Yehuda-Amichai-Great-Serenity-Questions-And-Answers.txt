title: Great Serenity: Questions And Answers

 People in a hall that�s lit so brightly
It hurts
Spoke of religion
In the lives of contemporary people
And on the place of God

People spoke in excited voices
Like in an airport
I left them
I opened an iron door that had written on it
�Emergency and I entered within.
