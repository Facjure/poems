title: Life Is Jolly
---

This life is jolly, O!
 I envy no man's lot;
My eyes can much admire,
 And still my heart crave not;
There's no true joy in gold,
 It breeds desire for more;
Whatever wealth man has,
 Desire can keep him poor.

This life is jolly, O!
 Power has his fawning slaves,
But if he rests his mind,
 Those wretches turn bold knaves.
Fame's field is full of flowers,
 It dazzles as we pass,
But men who walk that field
 Starve for the common grass.

This life is jolly, O!
 Let others know they die,
Enough to know I live,
 And make no question why;
I care not whence I came,
 Nor whither I shall go;
Let others think of these, 
 This life is jolly, O!
