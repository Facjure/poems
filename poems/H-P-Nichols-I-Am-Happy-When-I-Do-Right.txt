title: I Am Happy When I Do Right.
---

How glad it makes me feel at night,
When sitting on my mother's knee,
To hear her whisper "You've done right,
And tried my gentle child to be."

But then I feel ashamed and sad
If I've been cross and disobeyed,
Or if my selfish way I've had
When I with other children played.

So if at night I'd call to mind
A day of undisturbed delight,
The only way that I can find
Is to be loving and do right.
