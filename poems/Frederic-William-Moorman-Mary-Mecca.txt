Mary Mecca,(1) Mary Mecca,
 I'm fain to see thee here,
A Devon lass to fill my glass
 O' home-brewed Yorkshire beer.
I awlus said that foreigners
 Sud niver mel on me;
But sike a viewly face as thine
 I'd travel far to see.

Mary Mecca, Mary Mecca,
 I'm sad to see thee here,
Wheer t' wind blaws hask(2) frae Norway
 I' t' spring-time o' the year.
I'd liever finnd thee sittin',
 Wi' a bowl o' cruds an' cream,
Wheer t' foxglove bells ring through the dells,
 Anent a Dartmoor stream.

Mary Mecca, Mary Mecca,
 The way thou snods thy hair,
It maks my heart go dancin'
 Like winnlestraws(3) i' t' air.
One neet I heard thee singin',
 As I cam home frae toon;
'Twas sweet as curlews makkin' love
 Agean a risin' moon.

Mary Mecca, Mary Mecca,
 I dream o' thy gray een;
I think on all I've wasted,
 An' what I might hae been.
I'm nowt but muck off t' midden,
 So all I axe is this:
Just blaw the froth from off my yal(4);
 'Twill seem most like a kiss.
