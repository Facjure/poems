Would I might wake in you the whirl-wind soul
Of Michelangelo, who hewed the stone
And Night and Day revealed, whose arm alone
Could draw the face of God, the titan high
Whose genius smote like lightning from the sky - 
And shall he mold like dead leaves in the grave?
Nay he is in us!Let us dare and dare.
God help us to be brave.
