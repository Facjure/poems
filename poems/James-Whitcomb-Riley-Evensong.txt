 Lay away the story, - 
Though the theme is sweet,
 There's a lack of something yet,
Leaves it incomplete: - 
 There's a nameless yearning - 
Strangely undefined - 
 For a story sweeter still
Than the written kind.

 Therefore read no longer - 
I've no heart to hear
 But just something you make up,
O my mother dear. - 
 With your arms around me,
Hold me, folded-eyed, - 
 Only let your voice go on - 
I'll be satisfied.
