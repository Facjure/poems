title: Breaking The Day In Two
---

When from dawn till noon seems one long day,
 And from noon till night another,
Oh, then should a little boy come from play,
 And creep into the arms of his mother.
Snugly creep and fall asleep,
 Oh, come, my baby, do;
Creep into my lap, and with a nap
 We'll break the day in two.

When the shadows slant for afternoon,
 When the midday meal is over,
When the winds have sung themselves into a swoon,
 And the bees drone in the clover,
Then hie to me, hie, for a lullaby - 
 Come, my baby, do;
Creep into my lap, and with a nap
 We'll break the day in two.

We'll break it in two with a crooning song,
 With a soft and soothing number;
For the day has no right to be so long
 And keep my baby from slumber.
Then rock-a-by, rock, may white dreams flock
 Like angels over you;
Baby's gone, and the deed is done,
 We've broken the day in two.
