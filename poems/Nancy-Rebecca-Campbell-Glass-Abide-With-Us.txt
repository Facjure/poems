title: Abide With Us

"Abide with us!" Where could we go?
Thou art our strength, thou art our tower,
Our refuge from the ills below,
In darkness light, in weakness power.

"Abide with us!" We would prevail,
And plead that thou be ever near
To banish doubts when they assail,
And give deliverance from fear.

"Abide with us" in words of love,
For thou dost say, "Come unto me."
Oh, guide us to thy home above
To dwell in joy and peace with thee!
