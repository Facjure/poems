title: My Love, Thou Art A Nosegay Sweet.
---

 My love, thou art a nosegay sweet,
 My sweetest flower I'll prove thee,
 And pleased I pin thee to my breast,
 And dearly do I love thee.

 And when, my nosegay, thou shalt fade,
 As sweet a flower thou'lt prove thee;
 And as thou witherest on my breast
 For beauty past I'll love thee.

 And when, my nosegay, thou shalt die,
 And heaven's flower shalt prove thee,
 My hopes shall follow to the sky,
 And everlasting love thee.
