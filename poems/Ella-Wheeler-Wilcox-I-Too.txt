I saw fond lovers in that glow
 That oft-times fades away too soon:
I saw and said, 'Their joy I know - 
 I, too, have had my honeymoon.'

A young expectant mother's gaze
 Held earth and heaven within its scope:
My thoughts went back to holy days - 
 I said, 'I, too, have known that hope.'

I saw a stricken mother swayed
 By sorrow's storm, like wind-blown grass:
I said, 'I, too, dismayed
 Have seen the little white hearse pass.'

I saw a matron rich with years
 Walk radiantly beside her mate:
I blessed them, and said through my tears,
 'I, too, have known that high estate.'

I saw a woman swathed in black
 So blind with grief she could not see:
I said, 'Not far need I look back - 
 I, too, have known Gethsemane.'

I saw a face so full of light,
 It seemed with all God's truths to shine:
I said, 'I, too, have found my sight,
 I, too, have touched the Fact Divine.'
