title: A Solar Eclipse
---

In that great journey of the stars through space
 About the mighty, all-directing Sun,
The pallid, faithful Moon has been the one
Companion of the Earth.Her tender face,
Pale with the swift, keen purpose of that race
 Which at Time's natal hour was first begun,
 Shines ever on her lover as they run
And lights his orbit with her silvery smile.

Sometimes such passionate love doth in her rise,
 Down from her beaten path she softly slips,
And with her mantle veils the Sun's bold eyes,
 Then in the gloaming finds her lover's lips.
While far and near the men our world call wise
 See only that the Sun is in eclipse.
