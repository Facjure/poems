What the end the gods have destined unto thee and unto me,
Ask not: 'tis forbidden knowledge.Be content, Leuconoe.
Let alone the fortune-tellers.How much better to endure
Whatsoever shall betide us--even though we be not sure
Whether Jove grants other winters, whether this our last shall be
That upon the rocks opposing dashes now the Tuscan sea.
Be thou wise, and strain thy wines, and mindful of life's brevity
Stint thy hopes.The envious moments, even while we speak, have flown;
Trusting nothing to the future, seize the day that is our own.
