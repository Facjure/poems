title: The Blow Returned
---

 I struck you once, I do remember well.
Hard on the track of passion sorrow sped,
 And swift repentance, weeping for the blow;
I struck you once-and now you�re lying dead!

 Now you are gone the blow no longer sleeps
In your forgiveness hushed through all the years;
 But like a phantom haunts me through the dark,
To cry �You gave your own belov�d tears.�

 Stript now of all excuses, stern and stark,
With all your small transgressings dimmed or fled,
 The ghost returns the blow upon my heart
I struck you once-and now you�re lying dead.
