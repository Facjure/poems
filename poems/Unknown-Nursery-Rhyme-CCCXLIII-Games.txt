[The two following are fragments of a game called "The Lady of the Land," a complete version of which has not fallen in my way.]

Here comes a poor woman from baby-land,
With three small children in her hand:
One can brew, the other can bake,
The other can make a pretty round cake.
One can sit in the garden and spin,
Another can make a fine bed for the king;
Pray ma'am will you take one in?
