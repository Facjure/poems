What mortal, when he saw,
Life�s voyage done, his heavenly Friend,
Could ever yet dare tell him fearlessly:
�I have kept uninfring�d my nature�s law;
The inly-written chart thou gayest me
To guide me, I have steer�d by to the end�?

Ah! let us make no claim
On life�s incognizable sea
To too exact a steering of our way!
Let us not fret and fear to miss our aim
If some fair coast has lured us to make stay,
Or some friend hail�d us to keep company !

Aye, we would each fain drive
At random, and not steer by rule!
Weakness! and worse, weakness bestow�d in vain!
Winds from our side the unsuiting consort rive,
We rush by coasts where we had lief remain;
Man cannot, though he would, live chance�s fool.

No! as the foaming swathe
Of torn-up water, on the main,
Falls heavily away with long-drawn roar
On either side the black deep-furrow�d path
Cut by an onward-labouring vessel�s prore,
And never touches the ship-side again;

Even so we leave behind,
As, charter�d by some unknown Powers,
We stem across the sea of life by night,
The joys which were not for our use design�d,
The friends to whom we had no natural right,
The homes that were not destined to be ours.
