 Arise, my Isabel, arise!
 The sun shoots forth his early ray,
 The hue of love is in the skies,
 The birds are singing, come away!
 O come, my Isabella, come,
 With inky tendrils hanging low;
 Thy cheeks like roses just in bloom,
 That in the healthy Summer glow.

 That eye it turns the world away
 From wanton sport and recklessness;
 That eye beams with a cheerful ray,
 And smiles propitiously to bless.
 O come, my Isabella, dear!
 O come, and fill these longing arms!
 Come, let me see thy beauty here,
 And bend in worship o'er thy charms.

 O come, my Isabella, love!
 My dearest Isabella, come!
 Thy heart's affection, let me prove,
 And kiss thy beauty in its bloom.
 My Isabella, young and fair,
 Thou darling of my home and heart,
 Come, love, my bosom's truth to share,
 And of its being form a part.
