 "Bring me soft song," said Aladdin.
 "This tailor-shop sings not at all.
 Chant me a word of the twilight,
 Of roses that mourn in the fall.
 Bring me a song like hashish
 That will comfort the stale and the sad,
 For I would be mending my spirit,
 Forgetting these days that are bad,
 Forgetting companions too shallow,
 Their quarrels and arguments thin,
 Forgetting the shouting Muezzin:" - 
 "I AM YOUR SLAVE," said the Jinn.

 "Bring me old wines," said Aladdin.
 "I have been a starved pauper too long.
 Serve them in vessels of jade and of shell,
 Serve them with fruit and with song: - 
 Wines of pre-Adamite Sultans
 Digged from beneath the black seas: - 
 New-gathered dew from the heavens
 Dripped down from Heaven's sweet trees,
 Cups from the angels' pale tables
 That will make me both handsome and wise,
 For I have beheld her, the princess,
 Firelight and starlight her eyes.
 Pauper I am, I would woo her.
 And - let me drink wine, to begin,
 Though the Koran expressly forbids it."
 "I AM YOUR SLAVE," said the Jinn.

 "Plan me a dome," said Aladdin,
 "That is drawn like the dawn of the MOON,
 When the sphere seems to rest on the mountains,
 Half-hidden, yet full-risen soon."
 "Build me a dome," said Aladdin,
 "That shall cause all young lovers to sigh,
 The fullness of life and of beauty,
 Peace beyond peace to the eye - 
 A palace of foam and of opal,
 Pure moonlight without and within,
 Where I may enthrone my sweet lady."
 "I AM YOUR SLAVE," said the Jinn.
