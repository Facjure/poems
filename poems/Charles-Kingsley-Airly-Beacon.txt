Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;
 Oh the pleasant sight to see
Shires and towns from Airly Beacon,
 While my love climbed up to me!

Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;
 Oh the happy hours we lay
Deep in fern on Airly Beacon,
 Courting through the summer's day!

Airly Beacon, Airly Beacon;
 Oh the weary haunt for me,
All alone on Airly Beacon,
 With his baby on my knee!

1847.
