title: Song. "Dropt Here And There Upon The Flower"
---

Dropt here and there upon the flower
I love the dew to see,
For then returns the even's hour
That is so dear to me,
When silence reigns upon the plain,
And night hides all, or nearly;
For then I meet the smiles again
Of her I love so dearly.

O how I love yon dusky plains,
Though others there may be
As much belov'd by other swains,
But none so dear to me:
Their thorn-buds smell as sweet the while,
Their brooks may run as clearly;
But what are they without the smile
Of her I love so dearly.

In yonder bower the maid I've met,
Whom still I love to meet;
The dew-drops fall, the sun has set,
O evening thou art sweet!
Hope's eye fain breaks the misty glooms,
The time's expir'd, or nearly--
Ah, faithful still, and here she comes;
Who could but love thee dearly!

Though till we meet 'neath fate's control,
Who knows the luck that shall come,
And then, thou idol of my soul,
We'll meet, with happier welcome;
I wish I had, for sake of thee,
A lord's estate, or nearly;
They soon should see who'd ladies be,
And whom I love so dearly.
