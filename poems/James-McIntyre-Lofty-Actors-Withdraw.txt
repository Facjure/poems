title: Lofty Actors Withdraw.
---

As one by one the lofty actors of the age
Withdraw from changing play on history's page,
The act of war and peace of old and new contending
For it is long 'ere there's harmonious blending.

And many a noble actor brave and bold
Hath perished in the fight between the new and old,
The victor and the vanquished Lincoln and Lee,
The former he four million slaves set free.

The latter General fought with bravery and science,
The first he on the Lord placed strong reliance,
And in the justice of his cause he bade the North
As grand emancipators they should issue forth.

And o'er great North the conquering name of Grant
His mighty deeds of valour they 'ere more will chant,
And now doth pass from stage this last named actor,
In crushing Southern slavery potent factor.
