"It's bedtime, bedtime, Cissy dear,
It's time to put away,
Your little Noah's ark dear
Until another day,
You know it isn't right at all
To tire yourself with play.

And they too must be tired dear,
The elephants want to go
To bed, - if they're much later,
They'll all be ill I know,
And every well bred camel,
Is in bed long ago.

And surely you can see dear,
It really isn't right,
The little dove's so tired dear,
She scarce can stand upright.
It does not do to keep them up
So very late at night."
