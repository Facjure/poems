title: The Australian Stockman

The sun peers o�er you wooded ridge and thro� the forest dense,
Its golden edge o�er the mountain ledge looks down on the stockyard fence,
Looks down, looks down, looks down on the stockyard fence;
And dark creeks rush thro� the tangled brush, when their shuddering shadows throng
Until they chime in the rude rough rhyme of the wild goburra�s song.

 Chorus

 Till they chime, ha! ha! till they chime, ha! ha! in the wild goburra�s song;
 Till they chime, ha! ha! till they chime, ha! ha! in the wild goburra�s song.

The night owl to her home hath fled, to shun the glorious pomp
Of golden day she speeds away to her nest in the tea-tree swamp;
Away, away to her nest in the tea-tree swamp.

The dingo looks with a timid stare as he stealthily prowls along,
And his pattering feet in concert beat with the wild goburra�s song.

 Chorus: And they beat, ha! ha! &amp;c.

Oh! let them boast their city�s wealth, who toil in a dusty town;
Give me the beam on the mountain stream, and the range�s dark-faced frown�
The stream, the stream, and the range�s dark-faced frown.
When our steed shall pass o�er the quiv�ring grass, and the crack of the sounding thong
Shall bid the startled echoes join the wild goburra�s song.

 Chorus: And they join, ha! ha! &amp;c.
