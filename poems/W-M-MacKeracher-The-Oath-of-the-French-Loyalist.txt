title: The Oath of the French Loyalist.
---

I swear by the holy Virgin,
 I swear by her Son divine,
I swear by the throne of the Mighty,
 I swear by the hope that is mine;
I swear by the youth and innocence,
 By the beauty that has been,
I swear by the sacred ashes,
 By the blood of the martyred queen.

That I will avenge the outrage,
 So infamous, vile, and base,
The brutal and foul inhumanity,
 That darkens my land with disgrace;
Or meet like a noble gentleman
 The fate that my sovereign has met,
And die for my country's honour,
 For my queen, - Marie Antoinette.
