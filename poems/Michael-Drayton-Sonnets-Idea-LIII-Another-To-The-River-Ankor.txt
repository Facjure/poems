title: Sonnets: Idea LIII Another To The River Ankor
---

Clear Ankor, on whose silver-sanded shore,
My soul-shrined saint, my fair Idea lives;
O bless�d brook, whose milk-white swans adore
Thy crystal stream, refin�d by her eyes,
Where sweet myrrh-breathing Zephyr in the spring
Gently distils his nectar-dropping showers,
Where nightingales in Arden sit and sing
Amongst the dainty dew-impearl�d flowers;
Say thus, fair brook, when thou shalt see thy queen,
"Lo, here thy shepherd spent his wand'ring years
And in these shades, dear nymph, he oft hath been;
And here to thee he sacrificed his tears."
Fair Arden, thou my Tempe art alone,
And thou, sweet Ankor, art my Helicon!
