 Of sweethearts I have had a score,
And time may bring as many more;
 Tho' I remember all the rest,
Just now I worship dear C�leste;
 Hers may not be the greatest love,
But ah! it is the latest love.

For little Cupid's never stupid,
 As I've found out;
And love is truest when 'tis newest,
 Beyond a doubt, beyond a doubt.

 Of sweethearts I have had a score,
C�leste says I deserve no more;
 I take revenge on dear C�leste,
By telling her I love her best;
 Hers may not be the greatest love,
But ah! it is the latest love.

For little Cupid's never stupid,
 As I've found out;
And love is truest when 'tis newest,
 Beyond a doubt, beyond a doubt.
