title: He Will Not Come
---

Take out the blossom in your hair abloom,
 No more it seemeth beautiful, or bright,
And sickening is its subtly sweet perfume -
He will not come to-night.

Take off the necklace with its sparkling gem,
 And rings that glow and glitter in the light,
And fling them in the case that waits for them -
He will not come to-night.

Take off the robe a little while ago
 You chose, to make you fairer in his sight;
'Tis ten o'clock.So late you can but know
He will not come to-night.

He will not come.God grant you strength and grace,
 For never more upon your mortal sight
Shall dawn a glimpse of that beloved face
That did not come to-night.

He will not come.And through the shadowed years,
 The perfume of that blossom that you wore
Shall stir the fount of salt and bitter tears -
For one who comes no more.
