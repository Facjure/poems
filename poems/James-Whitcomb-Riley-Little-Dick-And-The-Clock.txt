 When Dicky was sick
In the night, and the clock,
 As he listened, said "Tick-
Atty - tick-atty - tock!"
 He said that it said,
Every time it said "Tick,"
 It said "Sick," instead,
And he heard it say "Sick!"
 And when it said "Tick-
Atty - tick-atty - tock,"
 He said it said "Sick-
Atty - sick-atty - sock!"
 And he tried to see then,
But the light was too dim,
 Yet he heard it again - 
And't was talking to him!

 And then it said "Sick-
Atty - sick-atty - sick
 You poor little Dick-
Atty - Dick-atty - dock!
 Have you got the hick-
Atties? Hi! send for Doc
 To hurry up quick
Atty - quick-atty - quock,
 And heat a hot brick-
Atty - brick-atty - brock,



 And rikle-ty wrap it
 And clickle-ty clap it
Against his cold feet-
 Al-ty - weep-aty - eepaty - 
 There he goes, slapit-
Ty - slippaty - sleepaty!"
