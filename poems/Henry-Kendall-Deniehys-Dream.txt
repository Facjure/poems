title: Deniehy�s Dream
---

Just when the western light
Flickered out dim,
Flushing the mountain-side,
Summit and rim,
A last, low, lingering gleam
Fell on a yellow stream,
And then there came a dream
Shining to him.

Splendours miraculous
Mixed with his pain
All like a vision of
Radiance and rain!
He faced the sea, the skies,
Old star-like thoughts did rise;
But tears were in his eyes,
Stifled in vain.

Infinite tokens of
Sorrows set free
Came in the dreaming wind
Far from the sea!
Past years about him trooped,
Fair phantoms round him stooped,
Sweet faces o�er him drooped
Sad as could be!

�This is our brother now:
Sisters, deplore
Man without purpose, like
Ship without shore!
He tracks false fire,� one said,
�But weep you he must tread
Whereto he may be led
Lost evermore.�

�Look,� said another,
�Summit and slope
Burn, in the mountain-land
Basement and cope!
Till daylight, dying dim,
Faints on the world�s red rim,
We�ll tint this Dream for him
Even with hope!�
