Ingerid Sletten of Sillejord
 Neither gold nor silver did own,
 But a little hood of gay wool alone,
Her mother had given of yore.

A little hood of gay wool alone,
 With no braid nor lining, was here;
 But parent love made it ever dear,
And brighter than gold it shone.

She kept the hood twenty years just so:
 "Be it spotless," softly she cried,
 "Until I shall wear it once as bride,
When I to the altar go."

She kept the hood thirty years just so:
 "Be it spotless," softly she cried,
 "Then wear it I will, a gladsome bride,
When it to our Lord I show."

She kept the hood forty years just so,
 With her mother ever in mind.
 "Little hood, be with me to this resigned,
That ne'er to the altar we'll go."

She steps to the chest where the hood has lain,
 And seeks it with swelling heart;
 She guides her hand to its place apart, - 
But never a thread did remain.
