Say there! P�r�aps
Some on you chaps
Might know Jim Wild?
Well, no offense:
Thar ain�t no sense
In gittin� riled!

Jim was my chum
Up on the Bar:
That�s why I come
Down from up yar,
Lookin� for Jim.
Thank ye, sir! You
Ain�t of that crew,
Blest if you are!

Money? Not much:
That ain�t my kind;
I ain�t no such.
Rum? I don�t mind,
Seein� it�s you.

Well, this yer Jim,
Did you know him?
Jes� �bout your size;
Same kind of eyes;
Well, that is strange:
Why, it�s two year
Since he came here,
Sick, for a change.

Well, here�s to us:
Eh?
The hyou say!
Dead?
That little cuss?

What makes you star�,
You over thar?
Can�t a man drop
�s glass in yer shop
But you must r�ar?
It wouldn�t take
Dd much to break
You and your bar.

Dead!
Poor little Jim!
Why, thar was me,
Jones, and Bob Lee,
Harry and Ben,
No-account men:
Then to take Him!

Well, tharGood-by
No more, sir I
Eh?
What�s that you say?
Why, dern it! sho!
No? Yes! By Joe!
Sold!

Sold! Why, you limb,
You ornery,
Derned old
Long-legged Jim.
