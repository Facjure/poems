title: Lais When Old
---

Lais, when old and all her beauty gone,
Lais, the erstwhile courted pleasure queen,
Walked homeless through Corinth.
 One mocked her mien - 
One tossed her coins; she took them and passed on.
Down by the harbour sloped a terraced lawn,
 Where fountains played; she paused to view the scene.
 A marble palace stood in bowers of green
'Twas here of old she revelled till the dawn.

Through yonder portico her lovers came - 
 Hero and statesman, athlete, merchant, sage;
They flung the whole world's treasures at her feet
To buy her favour and exalt her shame.

* * *

She spat upon her dole of coins in rage
 And faded like a phantom down the street.
