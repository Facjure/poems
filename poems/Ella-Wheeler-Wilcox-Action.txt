title: Action
---

For ever stars are winging
 Their swift and endless race;
For ever suns are swinging
 Their mighty globes through space.
Since by his law required
To join God's spheres inspired,
The earth has never tired,
 But whirled and whirled and whirled.
For ever streams are flowing,
For ever seeds are growing,
Alway is Nature showing
 That Action rules the world.

And since by God requested
 To BE, the glorious light
Has never paused or rested,
 But travelled day and night.
Yet pigmy man, unseeing
The purpose of his being,
Demands escape and freeing
 From universal force.
But law is law for ever,
And like a mighty lever
It thrusts him tow'rd endeavour,
 And speeds him on his course.
