 Once when my life was young,
 I, too, with Spring's bright face
 By mine, walked softly along,
Pace to his pace.

 Then burned his crimson may,
 Like a clear flame outspread,
 Arching our happy way:
Then would he shed

 Strangely from his wild face
 Wonderful light on me - 
 Like hounds that keen in chase
Their quarry see.

 Oh, sorrow now to know
 What shafts, what keenness cold
 His are to pierce me through,
Now that I'm old.
