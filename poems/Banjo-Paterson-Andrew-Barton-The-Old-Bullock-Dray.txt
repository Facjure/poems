Oh! the shearing is all over,
And the wool is coming down,
And I mean to get a wife, boys,
When I go up to town.
Everything that has two legs
Represents itself in view,
From the little paddy-melon
To the bucking kangaroo.

CHORUS

 So it�s roll up your blankets,
 And let�s make a push,
 I�ll take you up the country,
 And show you the bush.
 I�ll be bound you won�t get
 Such a chance another day,
 So come and take possession
 Of my old bullock dray.

Now, I�ve saved up a good cheque,
I mean to buy a team,
And when I get a wife, boys,
I�ll be all-serene
For calling at the dep�t.
They say there�s no delay
To get an off-sider
For the old bullock dray.

Oh! we�ll live like fighting cocks,
For good living, I�m your man.
We�ll have leather jacks, johnny cakes,
And fritters in the pan;
Or if you�d like some fish
I�ll catch you some soon,
For we�ll bob for barramundies
Round the banks of a lagoon.

Oh! yes, of beef and damper
I take care we have enough,
And we�ll boil in the bucket
Such a whopper of a duff,
And our friends will dance
To the honour of the day,
To the music of the bells,
Around the old bullock dray.

Oh! we�ll have plenty girls,
We must mind that.
There�ll be flash little Maggie,
And buckjumping Pat.
There�ll be Stringy bark Joe,
And Green-hide Mike.
Yes, my Colonials, just
As many as you like.

Now we�ll stop all immigration,
We won�t need it any more;
We�ll be having young natives,
Twins by the score.
And I wonder what the devil
Jack Robertson would say
If he saw us promenading
Round the old bullock dray.

Oh! it�s time I had an answer,
If there�s one to be had,
I wouldn�t treat that steer
In the body half as bad;
But he takes as much notice
Of me, upon my soul,
As that old blue stag
Off-side in the pole.

Oh! to tell a lot of lies,
You know, it is a sin,
But I�ll go up country
And marry a black gin.
Oh! �Baal gammon white feller,�
This is what she�ll say,
�Budgery you
And your old bullock dray.�
