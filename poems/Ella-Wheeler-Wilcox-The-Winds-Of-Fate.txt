title: The Winds Of Fate
---

One ship drives east and another drives west,
With the self-same winds that blow,
 'Tis the set of the sails
 And not the gales
That tell them the way to go.
Like the winds of the sea are the winds of fate,
As we voyage along through life,
 'Tis the set of the soul
 That decides its goal
And not the calm or the strife.
