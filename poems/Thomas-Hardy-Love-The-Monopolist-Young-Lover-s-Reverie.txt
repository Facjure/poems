The train draws forth from the station-yard,
 And with it carries me.
I rise, and stretch out, and regard
 The platform left, and see
An airy slim blue form there standing,
 And know that it is she.

While with strained vision I watch on,
 The figure turns round quite
To greet friends gaily; then is gone . . .
 The import may be slight,
But why remained she not hard gazing
 Till I was out of sight?

"O do not chat with others there,"
 I brood. "They are not I.
O strain your thoughts as if they were
 Gold bands between us; eye
All neighbour scenes as so much blankness
 Till I again am by!

"A troubled soughing in the breeze
 And the sky overhead
Let yourself feel; and shadeful trees,
 Ripe corn, and apples red,
Read as things barren and distasteful
 While we are separated!

"When I come back uncloak your gloom,
 And let in lovely day;
Then the long dark as of the tomb
 Can well be thrust away
With sweet things I shall have to practise,
 And you will have to say!"
