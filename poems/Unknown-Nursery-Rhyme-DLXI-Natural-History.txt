[The following song is given in Whiter's 'Specimen, or a Commentary on Shakespeare,' 8vo, London, 1794, p. 19, as common in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. Dr. Farmer gives another version as an illustration of a ditty of Jacques in 'As You Like It,' act ii, sc. 5. See Malone's Shakespeare, ed. 1821, vol. vi, p. 398; Caldecott's 'Specimen,' 1819, note on 'As You Like It,' p. 11; and Douce's 'Illustrations,' vol. i, p. 297.]

Dame, what makes your ducks to die?
What the pize ails 'em? what the pize ails 'em?
They kick up their heels, and there they lie,
What the pize ails 'em now?
Heigh, ho! heigh, ho!
Dame, what makes your ducks to die?
What a pize ails 'em? what a pize ails 'em?
Heigh, ho! heigh, ho!
Dame, what ails your ducks to die?
Eating o' polly-wigs, eating o' polly-wigs.
Heigh, ho! heigh, ho!
