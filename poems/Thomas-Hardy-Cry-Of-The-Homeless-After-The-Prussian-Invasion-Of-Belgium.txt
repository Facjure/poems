title: Cry Of The Homeless - After The Prussian Invasion Of Belgium
---

"Instigator of the ruin -
 Whichsoever thou mayst be
Of the masterful of Europe
 That contrived our misery -
Hear the wormwood-worded greeting
 From each city, shore, and lea
 Of thy victims:
 "Conqueror, all hail to thee!"

"Yea: 'All hail!' we grimly shout thee
 That wast author, fount, and head
Of these wounds, whoever proven
 When our times are throughly read.
'May thy loved be slighted, blighted,
 And forsaken,' be it said
 By thy victims,
 'And thy children beg their bread!'

"Nay: a richer malediction! -
 Rather let this thing befall
In time's hurling and unfurling
 On the night when comes thy call;
That compassion dew thy pillow
 And bedrench thy senses all
 For thy victims,
 Till death dark thee with his pall."

August 1915.
