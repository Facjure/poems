OD. ii. 15.


 Spouse of penniless Ibycus,
Thus late, bring to a close all thy delinquencies,
 All thy studious infamy:-
Nearing swiftly the grave - (that not an early one) -
 Cease girls' sport to participate,
Blurring stars which were else cloudlessly brilliant.
 What suits her who is beautiful
Suits not equally thee: rightly devastates
 Thy fair daughter the homes of men,
Wild as Thyad, who wakes stirred by the kettle-drums.
 Nothus' beauty constraining her,
Like some kid at his play, holds she her revelry:
 Thy years stately Luceria's
Wools more fitly become - not din of harpsichords,
 Not pink-petalled roseblossoms,
Not casks drained by an old lip to the sediment.
