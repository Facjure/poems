title: Regret Not Me

 Regret not me;
Beneath the sunny tree
I lie uncaring, slumbering peacefully.

 Swift as the light
I flew my faery flight;
Ecstatically I moved, and feared no night.

 I did not know
That heydays fade and go,
But deemed that what was would be always so.

 I skipped at morn
Between the yellowing corn,
Thinking it good and glorious to be born.

 I ran at eves
Among the piled-up sheaves,
Dreaming, "I grieve not, therefore nothing grieves."

 Now soon will come
The apple, pear, and plum
And hinds will sing, and autumn insects hum.

 Again you will fare
To cider-makings rare,
And junketings; but I shall not be there.

 Yet gaily sing
Until the pewter ring
Those songs we sang when we went gipsying.

 And lightly dance
Some triple-timed romance
In coupled figures, and forget mischance;

 And mourn not me
Beneath the yellowing tree;
For I shall mind not, slumbering peacefully.
