title: Song Of The Dardanelles

The wireless tells and the cable tells
How our boys behaved by the Dardanelles.
Some thought in their hearts �Will our boys make good?�
We knew them of old and we knew they would!
Knew they would,
Knew they would;
We were mates of old and we knew they would.

They laughed and they larked and they loved likewise,
For blood is warm under Southern skies;
They knew not Pharoah (�tis understood),
And they got into scrapes, as we knew they would.
Knew they would,
Knew they would;
And they got into scrapes, as we knew they would.

They chafed in the dust of an old dead land
At the long months� drill in the scorching sand;
But they knew in their hearts it was for their good,
And they saw it through as we knew they would.
Knew they would,
Knew they would;
And they saw it through as we knew they would.

The Coo-ee called through the Mena Camp,
And an army roared like the Ocean�s tramp
On a gale-swept beach in her wildest mood,
Till the Pyramids shook as we knew they would.
Knew they would,
Knew they would.
(And the Sphinx woke up as we knew she would.)

They were shipped like sheep when the dawn was grey;
(But their officers knew that no lambs were they).
They squatted and perched where�er they could,
And they �blanky-ed� for joy as we knew they would.
Knew they would,
Knew they would;
They �blanky-ed� for joy as we knew they would.

The sea was hell and the shore was hell,
With mine, entanglement, shrapnel and shell,
But they stormed the heights as Australians should,
And they fought and they died as we knew they would.
Knew they would,
Knew they would;
They fought and they died as we knew they would.

From the southern hills and the city lanes,
From the sandwaste lone and the Blacksoil Plains;
The youngest and strongest of England�s brood!,
They�ll win for the South as we knew they would.
Knew they would,
Knew they would;
They�ll win for the South as we knew they would.
