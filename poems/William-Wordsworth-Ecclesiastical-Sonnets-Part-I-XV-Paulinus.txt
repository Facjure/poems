 But, to remote Northumbria's royal Hall,
 Where thoughtful Edwin, tutored in the school
 Of sorrow, still maintains a heathen rule,
 'Who' comes with functions apostolical?
 Mark him, of shoulders curved, and stature tall,
 Black hair, and vivid eye, and meagre cheek,
 His prominent feature like an eagle's beak;
 A Man whose aspect doth at once appal
 And strike with reverence. The Monarch leans
 Toward the pure truths this Delegate propounds
 Repeatedly his own deep mind he sounds
 With careful hesitation, then convenes
 A synod of his Councilors: give ear,
 And what a pensive Sage doth utter, hear!
