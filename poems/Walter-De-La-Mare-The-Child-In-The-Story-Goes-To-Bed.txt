 I prythee, Nurse, come smooth my hair,
And prythee, Nurse, unloose my shoe,
 And trimly turn my silken sheet
Upon my quilt of gentle blue.

 My pillow sweet of lavender
Smooth with an amiable hand,
 And may the dark pass peacefully by
As in the hour-glass droops the sand.

 Prepare my cornered manchet sweet,
And in my little crystal cup
 Pour out the blithe and flowering mead
That forthwith I may sup.

 Withdraw my curtains from the night,
And let the crisp�d crescent shine
 Upon my eyelids while I sleep,
And soothe me with her beams benign.

 From far-away there streams the singing
Of the mellifluent nightingale, - 
 Surely if goblins hear her lay,
They shall not o'er my peace prevail.

 Now quench my silver lamp, prythee,
And bid the harpers harp that tune
 Fairies which haunt the meadowlands
Sing clearly to the stars of June.

 And bid them play, though I in dreams
No longer heed their pining strains,
 For I would not to silence wake
When slumber o'er my senses wanes.

 You Angels bright who me defend,
Enshadow me with curv�d wing,
 And keep me in the darksome night
Till dawn another day do bring.
