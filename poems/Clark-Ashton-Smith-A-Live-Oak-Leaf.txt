title: A Live-Oak Leaf
---

How marvellous this bit of green
 I hold, and soon shall throw away!
Its subtile veins, its vivid sheen,
 Seem fragment of a god's array.

In all the hidden toil of earth,
 Which is the more laborious part -
To rear the oak's enormous girth,
 Or shape its leaves with poignant art?
