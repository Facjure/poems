Is our renown'd Dominion then so small
 As not to hold this new inhabitant?
 Or are her means so pitiably scant
As not to yield a livelihood to all?
Or are we lesser men, foredoom'd to thrall?
 Or so much better than the immigrant
 That we should make our hearts as adamant
And guard against defilement with a wall?

Nay, but our land is large and rich enough
 For us and ours and millions more - her need
Is working men; she cries to let them in.
Nor can we fear; our race is not the stuff
 Servants are made of, but a royal seed,
And Christian, owning all mankind as kin.
