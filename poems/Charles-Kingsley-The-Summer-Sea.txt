 Soft soft wind, from out the sweet south sliding,
Waft thy silver cloud webs athwart the summer sea;
 Thin thin threads of mist on dewy fingers twining
Weave a veil of dappled gauze to shade my babe and me.

 Deep deep Love, within thine own abyss abiding,
Pour Thyself abroad, O Lord, on earth and air and sea;
 Worn weary hearts within Thy holy temple hiding,
Shield from sorrow, sin, and shame my helpless babe and me.

From The Water-Babies.1862
