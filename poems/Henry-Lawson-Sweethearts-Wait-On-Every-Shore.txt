title: Sweethearts Wait On Every Shore
---

She sits beside the tinted tide,
That�s reddened by the tortured sand;
And through the East, to ocean wide,
A vessel sails from sight of land.

But she will wait and watch in vain,
For it is said in Cupid�s lore,
�That he who loved will love again,
And sweethearts wait on every shore.�
