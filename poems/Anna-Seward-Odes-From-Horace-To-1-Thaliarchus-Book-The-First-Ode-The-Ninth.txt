 In dazzling whiteness, lo! Soracte towers,
 As all the mountain were one heap of snow!
 Rush from the loaded woods the glittering showers;
 The frost-bound waters can no longer flow.

 Let plenteous billets, on the glowing hearth,
 Dissolve the ice-dart ere it reach thy veins;
 Bring mellow wines to prompt convivial mirth,
 Nor heed th' arrested streams, or slippery plains.

 High Heaven, resistless in his varied sway,
 Speaks! - The wild elements contend no more;
 Nor then, from raging seas, the foamy spray
 Climbs the dark rocks, or curls upon the shore.

 And peaceful then yon aged ash shall stand;
 In breathless calm the dusky cypress rise;
 To-morrow's destiny the Gods command,
 To-day is thine; - enjoy it, and be wise!

 Youth's radiant tide too swiftly rolls away;
 Now, in its flow, let pleasures round thee bloom;
 Join the gay dance, awake the melting lay,
 Ere hoary tresses blossom for the tomb!

 Spears, and the Steed, in busy camps impel;
 And, when the early darkness veils the groves,
 Amid the leafless boughs let whispers steal,
 While frolic Beauty seeks the near alcoves.

 Soft as thy tip-toe steps the mazes rove,
 A laugh, half-smother'd, thy pleas'd ear shall meet,
 And, sportive in the charming wiles of love,
 Betray the artifice of coy retreat;

 And then the ring, or, from her snowy arm,
 The promis'd bracelet may thy force employ;
 Her feign'd reluctance, height'ning every charm,
 Shall add new value to the ravish'd toy.
