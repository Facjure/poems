Bouquet said: �My floral ring
The homage of a heart encloses,
Whose thoughts to you go worshipping
In perfume from my blushing roses.�

Bracelet said: �My rubies red,
Though hard the gleam that each exposes,
Will last when flowers of Spring are fled
And dead are all the Summer roses.�

Beauty mused awhile, and said,
�Here�s poesy!� and sighed, �Here prose is
Bouquet! I choose the rubies red!
In Winter they will buy me roses.�
