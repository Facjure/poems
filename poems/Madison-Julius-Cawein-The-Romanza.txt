In a kingdom of mist and moonlight,
 Or ever the world was known,
Past leagues of unsailed water,
There reigned a king with a daughter
 That shone like a starry stone.

The day grew out o' the moonlight;
 But never a day was there.
The king was wise as hoary,
And his daughter, like the glory
 Of seven kingdoms, fair.

And the night dimmed over the moonlight, - 
 And ever the mist was gray, - 
With slips of dull stars, bluer
Where the princess met her wooer,
 A page like the month o' May.

In her eyes the mist, and the moonlight
 In hair of a crumpled gold;
By day they wooed a-hawking,
A-hawking laughed, a-mocking
 The good, white king and old.

On the sea the mist, and the moonlight
 Poured pale to the lilies' tips; - 
At eve, when the hawks were feeding,
In courts to the kennels leading,
 He kissed her mouth and lips.

On towers the mist, and the moonlight
 On a dead face staring up; - 
His kingly couch was ready,
But and her hand was steady
 Giving the poisoned cup.
