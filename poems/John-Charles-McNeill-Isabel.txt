 When first I stood before you,
 Isabel,
 I stood there to adore you,
 In your spell;
 For all that grace composes,
 And all that beauty knows is
 Your face above the roses,
 Isabel.

 You knew the charm of flowers,
 Isabel,
 Which, like incarnate hours,
 Rose and fell
 At your bosom, glowed and gloried,
 White and pale and pink and florid,
 And you touched them with your forehead,
 Isabel.

 Amid the jest and laughter,
 Isabel,
 I saw you, and thereafter,
 Ill or well,
 There was nothing else worth seeing,
 Worth following or fleeing,
 And no reason else for being,
 Isabel.
