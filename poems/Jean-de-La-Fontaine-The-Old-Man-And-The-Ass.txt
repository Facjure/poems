title: The Old Man And The Ass.

[1]

 An old man, riding on his ass,
 Had found a spot of thrifty grass,
 And there turn'd loose his weary beast.
 Old Grizzle, pleased with such a feast,
 Flung up his heels, and caper'd round,
 Then roll'd and rubb'd upon the ground,
 And frisk'd and browsed and bray'd,
 And many a clean spot made.
 Arm'd men came on them as he fed:
 'Let's fly,' in haste the old man said.
 'And wherefore so?' the ass replied;
 'With heavier burdens will they ride?'
 'No,' said the man, already started.
 'Then,' cried the ass, as he departed,
 'I'll stay, and be - no matter whose;
 Save you yourself, and leave me loose.
 But let me tell you, ere you go,
 (I speak plain French, you know,)
 My master is my only foe.'
