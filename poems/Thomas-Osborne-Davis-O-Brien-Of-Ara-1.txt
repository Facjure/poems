Air--The Piper of Blessington.


I.

Tall are the towers of O'Ceinneidigh[2]--
Broad are the lands of MacCarrthaigh[3]--
Desmond feeds five hundred men a-day;
Yet, here's to O'Briain[4] of Ara!
Up from the Castle of Druim-aniar,[5]
Down from the top of Camailte,
Clansman and kinsman are coming here
To give him the CEAD MILE FAILTE.


II.

See you the mountains look huge at eve--
So is our chieftain in battle--
Welcome he has for the fugitive,--
Uisce-beatha[6] fighting, and cattle!
Up from the Castle of Druim-aniar,
Down from the top of Camailte
Gossip and ally are coming here
To give him the CEAD MILE FAILTE.


III.

Horses the valleys are tramping on,
Sleek from the Sacsanach manger--
Creachts the hills are encamping on,
Empty the bawns of the stranger!
Up from the Castle of Druim-aniar,
Down from the top of Camailte,
Ceithearn[7] and buannacht are coming here
To give him the CEAD MILE FAILTE.


IV.

He has black silver from Cill-da-lua[8]--
Rian[9] and Cearbhall[10] are neighbours--
'N Aonach[11] submits with a fuililiï¿½--
Butler is meat for our sabres!
Up from the Castle of Druim-aniar
Down from the top of Camailte,
Rian and Cearbhall are coming here
To give him the CEAD MILE FAILTE.


V.

'Tis scarce a week since through Osairghe[12]
Chased he the Baron of Durmhagh[13]--
Forced him five rivers to cross, or he
Had died by the sword of Red Murchadh![14]
Up from the Castle of Druim-aniar,
Down from the top of Camailte,
All the Ui Bhriain are coming here
To give him the CEAD MILE FAILTE.


VI.

Tall are the towers of O'Ceinneidigh--
Broad are the lands of MacCarrthaigh--
Desmond feeds five hundred men a-day;
Yet, here's to O'Briain of Ara!
Up from the Castle of Druim-aniar,
Down from the top of Camailte,
Clansman and kinsman are coming here
To give him the CEAD MILE FAILTE.
