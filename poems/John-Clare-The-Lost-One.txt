title: The Lost One
---

 I seek her in the shady grove,
 And by the silent stream;
 I seek her where my fancies rove,
 In many a happy dream;
 I seek her where I find her not,
 In Spring and Summer weather:
 My thoughts paint many a happy spot,
 But we ne'er meet together.

 The trees and bushes speak my choice,
 And in the Summer shower
 I often hear her pleasant voice,
 In many a silent hour:
 I see her in the Summer brook,
 In blossoms sweet and fair;
 In every pleasant place I look
 My fancy paints her there.

 The wind blows through the forest trees,
 And cheers the pleasant day;
 There her sweet voice is sure to be
 To lull my cares away.
 The very hedges find a voice,
 So does the gurgling rill;
 But still the object of my choice
 Is lost and absent still.
