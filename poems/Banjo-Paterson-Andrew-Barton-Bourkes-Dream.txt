Lonely and sadly one night in November
I laid down my weary head in search of repose
On my wallet of straw, which I long shall remember,
Tired and weary I fell into a doze.
Tired from working hard
Down in the labour yard,
Night brought relief to my sad, aching brain.
Locked in my prison cell,
Surely an earthly hell,
I fell asleep and began for to dream.

I dreamt that I stood on the green fields of Erin,
In joyous meditation that victory was won.
Surrounded by comrades, no enemy fearing.
�Stand,� was the cry, �every man to his gun.�
 On came the Saxons then,
 Fighting our Fenian men,
Soon they�ll reel back from our piked volunteers.
 Loud was the fight and shrill,
 Wexford and Vinegar Hill,
Three cheers for Father Murphy and the bold cavaliers.

I dreamt that I saw our gallant commander
Seated on his charger in gorgeous array.
He wore green trimmed with gold and a bright shining sabre
On which sunbeams of Liberty shone brightly that day.
�On,� was the battle cry,
�Conquer this day or die,
Sons of Hibernia, fight for Liberty!
Show neither fear nor dread,
Strike at the foeman�s head,
Cut down horse, foot, and artillery!�

I dreamt that the night was quickly advancing,
I saw the dead and dying on the green crimson plain.
Comrades I once knew well in death�s sleep reposing,
Friends that I once loved but shall ne�er see again.
The green flag was waving high,
Under the bright blue sky,
And each man was singing most gloriously.
�Come from your prison, Bourke,
We Irishmen have done our work,
God has been with us, and old Ireland is free.�

I dreamt I was homeward, back over the mountain track,
With joy my mother fainted and gave a loud scream.
With the shock I awoke, just as the day had broke,
And found myself an exile, and �twas all but a dream.
