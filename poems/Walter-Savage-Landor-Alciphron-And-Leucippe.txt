title: Alciphron And Leucippe
---

An ancient chestnut�s blossoms threw
Their heavy odour over two:
Leucippe, it is said, was one;
The other, then, was Alciphron.
�Come, come! why should we stand beneath?�
This hollow tree�s unwholesome breath?�
Said Alciphron, �here�s not a blade
Of grass or moss, and scanty shade.
Come; it is just the hour to rove
In the lone dingle shepherds love;
There, straight and tall, the hazel twig
Divides the crook�ed rock-held fig,
O�er the blue pebbles where the rill
In winter runs and may run still.
Come then, while fresh and calm the air,
And while the shepherds are not there.�

Leucippe.But I would rather go when they
 Sit round about and sing and play.
 Then why so hurry me? for you
 Like play and song, and shepherds too.

Alciphron. I like the shepherds very well,
 And song and play, as you can tell.
 But there is play, I sadly fear,
 And song I would not have you hear.

Leucippe.What can it be? What can it be?

Alciphron. To you may none of them repeat
 The play that you have play�d with me,
 The song that made your bosom beat.

Leucippe.Don�t keep your arm about my waist.

Alciphron. Might you not stumble?

Leucippe.Well then, do.
 But why are we in all this haste?

Alciphron. To sing.

Leucippe.Alas! and not play too?
