title: With A Ho-Ho-Ho! And A Hi-Hi-Hi!
---

With a ho-ho-ho! and a hi-hi-hi!
With a canzonet and tabor,
Thus, with ho-ho-ho! and our hi-hi-hi!
We amble, ramble, gambol, I
And my lily-fingered neighbor.

With a ha-ha-ha! and a he-he-he!
With a joyous laugh and caper,
Thus, with ha-ha-ha! and our he-he-he!
In sunlight, moonlight, starlight, we
Both consume our life's bright taper.

With a hi-hi-hi! and a ho-ho-ho!
With a prancing, dancing gaiter,
Thus, with hi-hi-hi! and our ho-ho-ho!
We ringing, singing, swinging, go,
Through the glees of our Creator.

With a he-he-he! and a ha-ha-ha!
Through all spells of wind or weather,
Thus, with he-he-he! and our ha-ha-ha!
Till frailing, ailing, failing, ah!
We will die and lie together.

Thus, with ho-ho-ho! and a hi-hi-hi!
With a canzonet and tabor,
Yea, with ho-ho-ho! and our hi-hi-hi!
We amble, ramble, gambol, I
And my lily-fingered neighbor.
