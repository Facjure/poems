�Beneath the greenwood bough.�
- W. Scott.

Lightly the breath of the spring wind blows,
Though laden with faint perfume,
�Tis the fragrance rare that the bushman knows,
The scent of the wattle bloom.
Two-thirds of our journey at least are done,
Old horse! let us take a spell
In the shade from the glare of the noonday sun,
Thus far we have travell�d well;
Your bridle I�ll slip, your saddle ungirth,
And lay them beside this log,
For you�ll roll in that track of reddish earth,
And shake like a water-dog.

Upon yonder rise there�s a clump of trees,
Their shadows look cool and broad,
You can crop the grass as fast as you please,
While I stretch my limbs on the sward;
�Tis pleasant, I ween, with a leafy screen
O�er the weary head, to lie
On the mossy carpet of emerald green,
�Neath the vault of the azure sky;
Thus all alone by the wood and wold,
I yield myself once again
To the memories old that, like tales fresh told,
Come flitting across the brain.
