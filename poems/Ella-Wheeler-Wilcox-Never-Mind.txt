Whatever your work and whatever its worth,
 No matter how strong or clever,
Some one will sneer if you pause to hear,
 And scoff at your best endeavour.
For the target art has a broad expanse,
 And wherever you chance to hit it,
Though close be your aim to the bull's-eye fame,
 There are those who will never admit it.

Though the house applauds while the artist plays,
 And a smiling world adores him,
Somebody is there with an ennuied air
 To say that the acting bores him.
For the tower of art has a lofty spire,
 With many a stair and landing,
And those who climb seem small oft-time
 To one at the bottom standing.

So work along in your chosen niche
 With a steady purpose to nerve you;
Let nothing men say who pass your way
 Relax your courage or swerve you.
The idle will flock by the Temple of Art
 For just the pleasure of gazing;
But climb to the top and do not stop,
 Though they may not all be praising.
