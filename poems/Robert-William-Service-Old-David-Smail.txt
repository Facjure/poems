 He dreamed away his hours in school;
 He sat with such an absent air,
 The master reckoned him a fool,
 And gave him up in dull despair.

 When other lads were making hay
 You'd find him loafing by the stream;
 He'd take a book and slip away,
 And just pretend to fish . . . and dream.

 His brothers passed him in the race;
 They climbed the hill and clutched the prize.
 He did not seem to heed, his face
 Was tranquil as the evening skies.

 He lived apart, he spoke with few;
 Abstractedly through life he went;
 Oh, what he dreamed of no one knew,
 And yet he seemed to be content.

 I see him now, so old and gray,
 His eyes with inward vision dim;
 And though he faltered on the way,
 Somehow I almost envied him.

 At last beside his bed I stood:
 "And is Life done so soon?" he sighed;
 "It's been so rich, so full, so good,
 I've loved it all . . ." - and so he died.
