[NOTE. - The following imitation of Cowper's Boadicea was written in 1858; most of its predictions have since been fulfilled.]

When the Cambridge flower-show ended,
And the flowers and guests were gone,
And the evening shades descended,
Roamed a man forlorn alone.

Sage beside the River slow
Sat the Don renowned for lore
And in accents soft and low
To the elms his love did pour.

"Julia, if my learned eyes
Gaze upon thy matchless face:
'Tis because I feel there lies
Magic in thy lovely grace.

"I will marry! write that threat
In the ink I daily waste:
Marry - pay each College debt - 
College Ale no more will taste.

"Granta, far and wide renowned,
Frowns upon the married state;
Soon her pride shall kiss the ground
Hark!Reform is at the gate.

"Other Fellows shall arise,
Proud to own a husband's name:
Proud to own their infants' cries - 
Harmony the path to fame.

"Then the progeny that springs
From our ancient College walls,
Armed with trumpets, noisy things,
Shall astound us by their squalls.

"Sounds no wrangler yet has heard,
Our posterity shall fright:
E'en 'the Eagle,' [1] valiant bird,
Shall betake itself to flight."

Such the thoughts that through him whirl'd
Pensively reclining there:
Smiling, as his fingers curled
His divinely-glowing hair.

He, with all a lover's pride,
Felt his manly bosom glow,
Sought the Bull, besought the Bride,
All she said was "No, Sir, No!"

Julia, pitiless as cold,
Lo the vengeance due from Heaven!
College Living he doth hold;
Single bliss to thee is given.
