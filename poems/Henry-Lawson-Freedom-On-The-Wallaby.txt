title: Freedom on the Wallaby
---

Our fathers toiled for bitter bread
While idlers thrived beside them;
But food to eat and clothes to wear
Their native land denied them.
They left their native land in spite
Of royalties� regalia,
And so they came, or if they stole
Were sent out to Australia.

They struggled hard to make a home,
Hard grubbing �twas and clearing.
They weren�t troubled much with toffs
When they were pioneering;
And now that we have made the land
A garden full of promise,
Old greed must crook his dirty hand
And come to take it from us.

But Freedom�s on the Wallaby,
She�ll knock the tyrants silly,
She�s going to light another fire
And boil another billy.
We�ll make the tyrants feel the sting
Of those that they would throttle;
They needn�t say the fault is ours
If blood should stain the wattle.
