title: The Wind Blew Words
---

The wind blew words along the skies,
 And these it blew to me
Through the wide dusk: "Lift up your eyes,
 Behold this troubled tree,
Complaining as it sways and plies;
 It is a limb of thee.

"Yea, too, the creatures sheltering round -
 Dumb figures, wild and tame,
Yea, too, thy fellows who abound -
 Either of speech the same
Or far and strange - black, dwarfed, and browned,
 They are stuff of thy own frame."

I moved on in a surging awe
 Of inarticulateness
At the pathetic Me I saw
 In all his huge distress,
Making self-slaughter of the law
 To kill, break, or suppress.
