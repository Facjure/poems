 I saw the day lean o'er the world's sharp edge
 And peer into night's chasm, dark and damp;
 High in his hand he held a blazing lamp,
 Then dropped it and plunged headlong down the ledge.

 With lurid splendor that swift paled to gray,
 I saw the dim skies suddenly flush bright.
 'Twas but the expiring glory of the light
 Flung from the hand of the adventurous day.
