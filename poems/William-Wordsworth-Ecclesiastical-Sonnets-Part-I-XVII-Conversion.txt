 Prompt transformation works the novel Lore;
 The Council closed, the Priest in full career
 Rides forth, an armed man, and hurls a spear
 To desecrate the Fane which heretofore
 He served in folly. Woden falls, and Thor
 Is overturned; the mace, in battle heaved
 (So might they dream) till victory was achieved,
 Drops, and the God himself is seen no more.
 Temple and Altar sink, to hide their shame
 Amid oblivious weeds. "O come to me,
 Ye heavy laden!" such the inviting voice
 Heard near fresh streams; and thousands who rejoice
 In the new Rite, the pledge of sanctity,
 Shall, by regenerate life, the promise claim.
