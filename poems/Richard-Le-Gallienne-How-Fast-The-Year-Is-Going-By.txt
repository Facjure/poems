title: How Fast The Year Is Going By
---

How fast the year is going by!
Love, it will be September soon;
O let us make the best of June.
Already, love, it is July;
The rose and honeysuckle go,
And all too soon will come the snow.

Dark berries take the place of flowers,
Of summer August still remains,
Then sad September with her rains.
O love, how short a year is ours - 
So swiftly does the summer fly,
Scarce time is left to say goodbye.
