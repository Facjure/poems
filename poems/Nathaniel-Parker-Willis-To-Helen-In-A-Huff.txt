title: To Helen In A Huff
---

Nay, lady, one frown is enough
In a life as soon over as this,
And though minutes seem long in a huff,
They�re minutes �tis pity to miss!
The smiles you imprison so lightly
Are reckon�d, like days in eclipse;
And though you may smile again brightly,
You�ve lost so much light from your lips!
Pray, lady, smile!

The cup that is longest untasted
May be with our bliss running o�er,
And, love when we will, we have wasted
An age in not loving before!
Perchance Cupid�s forging a fetter
To tie us together some day,
And, just for the chance, we had better
Be laying up love, I should say!
Nay, lady, smile!
