Turn Thou the key upon our thoughts, dear Lord,
 And let us sleep;
Give us our portion of forgetfulness,
 Silent and deep.

Lay Thou Thy quiet hand upon our eyes
 To close their sight;
Shut out the shining of the moon and stars
 And candle-light.

Keep back the phantoms and the visions sad,
 The shades of grey,
The fancies that so haunt the little hours
 Before the day.

Quiet the time-worn questions that are all
 Unanswered yet,
Take from the spent and troubled souls of us
 Their vain regret;

And lead us far into Thy silent land,
 That we may go
Like children out across the field o' dreams
 Where poppies blow.

So all Thy saints - and all Thy sinners too - 
 Wilt Thou not keep,
Since not alone unto Thy well-beloved
 Thou givest sleep?
