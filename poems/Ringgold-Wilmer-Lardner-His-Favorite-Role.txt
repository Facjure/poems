title: His Favorite Role
---

You could be president as well as not,
 Since all you'd have to do is think you were,
With that imagination that you've got;
 Or multimillionaire if you prefer,
Or you could be some famous football star,
 Or Tyrus Cobb, admired by ev'ry fan;
Instead of that, you tell me that you are
 The Garbage Man.

Why pick him out, when you can take your choice?
 Is his so charming, nice, and sweet a role
That acting it should make you to rejoice
 And be a source of comfort to your soul?
Is there some hidden happiness that he
 Uncovers in his march from can to can
That you above all else should want to be
 The Garbage Man?
