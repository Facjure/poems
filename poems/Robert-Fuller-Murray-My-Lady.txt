My Lady of all ladies!Queen by right
 Of tender beauty; full of gentle moods;
 With eyes that look divine beatitudes,
Large eyes illumined with her spirit's light;

Lips that are lovely both by sound and sight,
 Breathing such music as the dove, which broods
 Within the dark and silence of the woods,
Croons to the mate that is her heart's delight.

Where is a line, in cloud or wave or hill,
 To match the curve which rounds her soft-flushed cheek?
A colour, in the sky of morn or of even,
To match that flush?Ah, let me now be still!
 If of her spirit I should strive to speak,
I should come short, as earth comes short of heaven.
