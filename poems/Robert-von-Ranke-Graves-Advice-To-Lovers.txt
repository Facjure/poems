title: Advice To Lovers.

 I knew an old man at a Fair
 Who made it his twice-yearly task
 To clamber on a cider cask
 And cry to all the yokels there:, 

 "Lovers to-day and for all time
Preserve the meaning of my rhyme:
Love is not kindly nor yet grim
But does to you as you to him.

 "Whistle, and Love will come to you,
Hiss, and he fades without a word,
Do wrong, and he great wrong will do,
Speak, he retells what he has heard.

 "Then all you lovers have good heed
Vex not young Love in word or deed:
Love never leaves an unpaid debt,
He will not pardon nor forget."

 The old man's voice was sweet yet loud
 And this shows what a man was he,
 He'd scatter apples to the crowd
 And give great draughts of cider, free.
