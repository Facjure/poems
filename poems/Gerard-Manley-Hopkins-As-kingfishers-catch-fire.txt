title: As kingfishers catch fire
---

As kingfishers catch fire, dragonflies dr�w fl�me;
As tumbled over rim in roundy wells
Stones ring; like each tucked string tells, each hung bell's
Bow swung finds tongue to fling out broad its name;
Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:
Deals out that being indoors each one dwells;
Selves - goes itself; myself it speaks and spells,
Crying Wh�t I do is me: for that I came.

� say m�re: the just man justices;
K�eps grace: th�t keeps all his goings graces;
Acts in God's eye what in God's eye he is - 
Chr�st - for Christ plays in ten thousand places,
Lovely in limbs, and lovely in eyes not his
To the Father through the features of men's faces.
