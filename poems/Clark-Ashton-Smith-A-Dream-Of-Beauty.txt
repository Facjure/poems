title: A Dream Of Beauty
---

I dreamed that each most lovely, perfect thing
 That Nature hath, of sound, and form, and hue -
 The winds, the grass, the light-concentering dew,
The gleam and swiftness of the sea-bird's wing;
Blueness of sea and sky, and gold of storm
Transmuted by the sunset, and the flame
 Of autumn-colored leaves, before me came,
And, meeting, merged to one diviner form.

Incarnate Beauty 'twas, whose spirit thrills
Through glaucous ocean and the greener hills,
 And in the cloud-bewildered peaks is pent.
Like some descended star she hovered o'er,
 But as I gazed, in doubt and wonderment,
Mine eyes were dazzled, and I saw no more.
