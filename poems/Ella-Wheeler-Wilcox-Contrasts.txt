I see the tall church steeples - 
 They reach so far, so far;
But the eyes of my heart see the world's great mart
Where the starving people are.

 I hear the church bells ringing
 Their chimes on the morning air;
But my soul's sad ear is hurt to hear
 The poor man's cry of despair.

Thicker and thicker the churches,
 Nearer and nearer the sky - 
But alack for their creeds while the poor man's needs
 Grow deeper as years roll by!
