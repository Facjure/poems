On grassy amphitheatre,
Spectators sit to view the war,
'Mong bold contestants on the plain
Where each doth strive the prize to gain.

Come witness the great tug of war,
And see great hammer thrown afar,
See running, jumping, highland fling,
At concert hear the skylark sing.

And the bagpipes will send thrills,
Like echoes from the distant hills,
And the bold sound of the pibroch,
Which does resound o'er highland loch.

Young men and maids and fine old dames
Will gather on the banks of Thames,
And though we have a tug of war
'Twill leave no wound or deadly scar.
