 (Air: �Wearing of the Green.�)


If you want a situation, I�ll just tell you the plan
To get on to a station, I am just your very man.
Pack up the old portmanteau, and label it Paroo,
With a name aristocratic�Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.

When you get on to the station, of small things you�ll make a fuss,
And in speaking of the station, mind, it�s we, and ours, and us.
Boast of your grand connections and your rich relations, too
And your own great expectations, Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.

They will send you out on horseback, the boundaries to ride
But run down a marsupial and rob him of his hide,
His scalp will fetch a shilling and his hide another two,
Which will help to fill your pockets, Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.
Yes, to fill your empty pockets, Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.

When the boss wants information, on the men you�ll do a sneak,
And don a paper collar on your fifteen bob a week.
Then at the lamb-marking a boss they�ll make of you.
Now that�s the way to get on, Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.

A squatter in the future I�ve no doubt you may be,
But if the banks once get you, they�ll put you up a tree.
To see you humping bluey, I know, would never do,
�Twould mean good-bye to our new chum, Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.
Yes, good-bye to our new chum, Jimmy Sago, Jackaroo.
