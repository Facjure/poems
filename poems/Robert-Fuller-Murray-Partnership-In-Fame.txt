title: Partnership In Fame
---

Love, when the present is become the past,
 And dust has covered all that now is new,
 When many a fame has faded out of view,
And many a later fame is fading fast--

If then these songs of mine might hope to last,
 Which sing most sweetly when they sing of you,
 Though queen and empress wore oblivion's hue,
Your loveliness would not be overcast.

Now, while the present stays with you and me,
 In love's copartnery our hearts combine,
Life's loss and gain in equal shares to take.
Partners in fame our memories then would be:
 Your name remembered for my songs; and mine
Still unforgotten for your sweetness' sake.
