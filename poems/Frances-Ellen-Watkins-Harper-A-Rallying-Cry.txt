title: A Rallying Cry.

 Oh, children of the tropics,
 Amid our pain and wrong
 Have you no other mission
 Than music, dance, and song?

 When through the weary ages
 Our dripping tears still fall,
 Is this a time to dally
 With pleasure's silken thrall?

 Go, muffle all your viols;
 As heroes learn to stand,
 With faith in God's great justice
 Nerve every heart and hand.

 Dream not of ease nor pleasure,
 Nor honor, wealth, nor fame,
 Till from the dust you've lifted
 Our long-dishonored name;

 And crowned that name with glory
 By deeds of holy worth,
 To shine with light emblazoned,
 The noblest name on earth.

 Count life a dismal failure,
 Unblessing and unblest,
 That seeks 'mid ease inglorious
 For pleasure or for rest.

 With courage, strength, and valor
 Your lives and actions brace;
 Shrink not from toil or hardship,
 And dangers bravely face.

 Engrave upon your banners,
 In words of golden light,
 That honor, truth, and justice
 Are more than godless might.

 Above earth's pain and sorrow
 Christ's dying face I see;
 I hear the cry of anguish:--
 "Why hast thou forsaken me?"

 In the pallor of that anguish
 I see the only light,
 To flood with peace and gladness
 Earth's sorrow, pain, and night.

 Arrayed in Christly armor
 'Gainst error, crime, and sin,
 The victory can't be doubtful,
 For God is sure to win.
