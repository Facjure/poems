[The first line of the following is the burden of a song in the 'Tempest,' act i, sc. 2. and also of one in the 'Merchant of Venice, act iii, sc. 2.]

Ding dong bell,
Pussy's in the well!
Who put her in? - 
Little Tommy Lin.
Who pulled her out? - 
Dog with long snout.
What a naughty boy was that
To drown poor pussy-cat,
Who never did any harm,
But kill'd the mice in his father's barn.
