title: The Stockman�s Last Bed
---

Be ye stockmen or no, to my story give ear.
Alas! for poor Jack, no more shall we hear
The crack of his stockwhip, his steed�s lively trot,
His clear �Go ahead, boys,� his jingling quart pot.

Chorus

 For we laid him where wattles their sweet fragrance shed,
 And the tall gum trees shadow the stockman�s last bed.

Whilst drafting one day he was horned by a cow.
�Alas!� cried poor Jack, �it�s all up with me now,
For I never again shall my saddle regain,
Nor bound like a wallaby over the plain.�

His whip it is silent, his dogs they do mourn,
His steed looks in vain for his master�s return;
No friend to bemoan him, unheeded he dies;
Save Australia�s dark sons, few know where he lies.

Now, stockman, if ever on some future day
After the wild mob you happen to stray,
Tread softly where wattles their sweet fragrance spread,
Where alone and neglected poor Jack�s bones are laid.
