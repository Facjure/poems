TO E. S. R.


The new year coming to us with swift feet
Is the King's gift,
And all that in it lies
Will make our lives more rounded and complete.
It may be laughter,
May be tear-filled eyes;
It may be gain of love,
Or loss of love;
It may be thorns, or bloom and breath of flowers,
 The full fruition of these hopes that move - 
It may be what will break these hearts of ours,
What matter? 'Tis the great gift of the King - 
We do not need to fear what it may bring.
