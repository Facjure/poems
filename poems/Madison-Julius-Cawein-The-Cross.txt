 The cross I bear no man shall know 
 No man can ease the cross I bear! 
 Alas! the thorny path of woe
 Up the steep hill of care!

 There is no word to comfort me;
 No sign to help my bended head;
 Deep night lies over land and sea,
 And silence dark and dread.

 To strive, it seems, that I was born,
 For that which others shall obtain;
 The disappointment and the scorn
 Alone for me remain.

 One half my life is overpast;
 The other half I contemplate 
 Meseems the past doth but forecast
 A darker future state.

 Sick to the heart of that which makes
 Me hope and struggle and desire,
 The aspiration here that aches
 With ineffectual fire;

 While inwardly I know the lack,
 The insufficiency of power,
 Each past day's retrospect makes black
 Each morrow's coming hour.

 Now in my youth would I could die! 
 As others love to live, go down
 Into the grave without a sigh,
 Oblivious of renown!
