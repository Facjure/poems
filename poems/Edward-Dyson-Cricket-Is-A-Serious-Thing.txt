title: Cricket Is A Serious Thing
---

In politics there�s room for jest;
With frequent gibes are speeches met,
And measures which are of the best
Are themes for caustic humor yet.
E�en though the pulpiteer we fret
With sundry quiddities we fling,
We pray you never to forget
That cricket is a serious thing.

The crowd assembles at a Test,
And Hobbs at length is fairly set,
Though Gregory rocks �em in with zest;
The barrackers may fume and fret
When Parkin has contrived to get
Five men of ours, we feel the sting,
And give expression to regret,
For cricket is a serious thing.

They have the lead; we would arrest
A sort of rot.No epithet
Is proper, though they�ve got our best
For next to nothing, and your bet
Is good as lost.Don�t sit and sweat;
Due reverence to the problem bring.
We have a pile of runs to net,
Ah, cricket is a serious thing.
