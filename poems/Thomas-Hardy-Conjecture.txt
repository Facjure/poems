If there were in my kalendar
 No Emma, Florence, Mary,
What would be my existence now -
 A hermit's? - wanderer's weary? -
 How should I live, and how
 Near would be death, or far?

Could it have been that other eyes
 Might have uplit my highway?
That fond, sad, retrospective sight
 Would catch from this dim byway
 Prized figures different quite
 From those that now arise?

With how strange aspect would there creep
 The dawn, the night, the daytime,
If memory were not what it is
 In song-time, toil, or pray-time. -
 O were it else than this,
 I'd pass to pulseless sleep!
