I.
DOSN�T thou �ear my �erse�s legs, as they canters awa�y?
Proputty, proputty, proputty�that�s what I �ears �em sa�y.
Proputty, proputty, proputty�Sam, thou�s an ass for thy paa�ns:
Theer�s moor sense i� one o� �is legs nor in all thy bra�ins.

II.
Wo�theer�s a craw to pluck wi� tha, Sam: yon�s parson�s �ouse�
Dosn�t thou knaw that a man mun be e�ther a man or a mouse?
Time to think on it then; for thou�ll be twenty to wee�k.
Proputty, proputty�wo� then, wo�let ma �ear mys�n spe�k.

III.
Me an� thy muther, Sammy, �as be�n a-talkin� o� thee;
Thou�s be�n talkin� to muther, an� she be�n a tellin� it me.
Thou�ll not marry for munny�thou�s sweet upo� parson�s lass�
No�thou�ll marry fur luvv�an� we bo�th on us thinks tha an ass.

IV.
See�d her toda�y go� by�Sa�int�s-da�y�they was ringing the bells.
She�s a beauty thou thinks�an� so� is scoors o� gells,
Them as �as munny an� all�wot�s a beauty?�the flower as blaws.
But proputty, proputty sticks, an� proputty, proputty graws.

V.
Do�ant be stunt: ta�k time: I knaws what ma�kes tha sa mad.
Warn�t I cra�zed fur the lasses mys�n when I wur a lad?
But I knawed a Qua�ker feller as often �as towd ma this:
�Do�nt thou marry for munny, but go� wheer munny is!�

VI.
An� I went wheer munny war: an� thy muther coom to �and,
Wi� lots o� munny laa�d by, an� a nicetish bit o� land.
Ma�ybe she warn�t a beauty:�I niver giv it a thowt�
But warn�t she as good to cuddle an� kiss as a lass as �ant nowt?

VII.
Parson�s lass �ant nowt, an� she we�nt �a nowt when �e�s de�d,
Mun be a guvness, lad, or summut, and addle her bre�d:
Why? fur �e�s nobbut a curate, an� we�nt niver git hissen clear,
An� �e ma�de the bed as �e ligs on afoor �e coomed to the shere.

VIII.
An thin �e coom�d to the parish wi� lots o� Varsity debt,
Stook to his taa�l they did, an� �e �ant got shut on �em yet.
An� �e ligs on �is back i� the grip, wi� no�n to lend �im a shovv,
Woorse nor a far-welter�d yowe: fur, Sammy, �e married fur luvv.

IX.
Luvv? what�s luvv? thou can luvv thy lass an� �er munny too,
Ma�kin� �em goa� togither as they�ve good right to do.
Could�n I luvv thy muther by cause o� �er munny laa�d by?
Na�y�fur I luvv�d �er a vast sight moor fur it: re�son why.

X.
Ay an� thy muther says thou wants to marry the lass,
Cooms of a gentleman burn: an� we bo�th on us thinks tha an ass.
Wo� then, proputty, wiltha?�an ass as near as mays nowt�
Wo� then, wiltha? dangtha!�the bees is as fell as owt.

XI.
Bre�k me a bit o� the esh for his �e�d, lad, out o� the fence!
Gentleman burn! what�s gentleman burn? is it shillins an� pence?
Proputty, proputty�s ivrything �ere, an�, Sammy, I�m blest
If it isn�t the sa�me oop yonder, fur them as �as it�s the best.

XII.
Tis�n them as �as munny as breaks into �ouses an� ste�ls,
Them as �as co�ts to their backs an� ta�kes their regular me�ls.
No�, but it�s them as niver knaws wheer a me�l�s to be �ad.
Ta�ke my word for it, Sammy, the poor in a loomp is bad.

XIII.
Them or thir feythers, tha sees, mun �a be�n a la�zy lot,
Fur work mun �a gone to the gittin� whiniver munny was got.
Feyther �ad ammost nowt; le�stways �is munny was �id.
But �e tued an� moil�d �iss�n de�d, an �e died a good un, �e did.

XIV.
Loook thou theer wheer Wrigglesby beck cooms out by the �ill!
Feyther run oop to the farm, an� I runs oop to the mill;
An� I�ll run oop to the brig, an� that thou�ll live to see;
And if thou marries a good un I�ll le�ve the land to thee.

XV.
Thim�s my no�tions, Sammy, wheerby I means to stick;
But if thou marries a bad un, I�ll le�ve the land to Dick.�
Coom oop, proputty, proputty�that�s what I �ears �im sa�y�
Proputty, proputty, proputty�canter an� canter awa�y.
