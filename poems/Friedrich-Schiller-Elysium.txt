 Past the despairing wail
 And the bright banquets of the Elysian vale
 Melt every care away!
 Delight, that breathes and moves forever,
 Glides through sweet fields like some sweet river!
 Elysian life survey!
 There, fresh with youth, o'er jocund meads,
 His merry west-winds blithely leads
 The ever-blooming May!
 Through gold-woven dreams goes the dance of the hours,
 In space without bounds swell the soul and its powers,
 And truth, with no veil, gives her face to the day.
 And joy to-day and joy to-morrow,
 But wafts the airy soul aloft;
 The very name is lost to sorrow,
 And pain is rapture tuned more exquisitely soft.

 Here the pilgrim reposes the world-weary limb,
 And forgets in the shadow, cool-breathing and dim,
 The load he shall bear never more;
 Here the mower, his sickle at rest, by the streams,
 Lulled with harp-strings, reviews, in the calm of his dreams,
 The fields, when the harvest is o'er.
 Here, he, whose ears drank in the battle roar,
 Whose banners streamed upon the startled wind
 A thunder-storm, before whose thunder tread
 The mountains trembled, in soft sleep reclined,
 By the sweet brook that o'er its pebbly bed
 In silver plays, and murmurs to the shore,
 Hears the stern clangor of wild spears no more!
 Here the true spouse the lost-beloved regains,
 And on the enamelled couch of summer-plains
 Mingles sweet kisses with the zephyr's breath.
 Here, crowned at last, love never knows decay,
 Living through ages its one bridal day,
 Safe from the stroke of death!
