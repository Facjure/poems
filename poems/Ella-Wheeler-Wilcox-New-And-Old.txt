 I and new love, in all its living bloom,
 Sat vis-a-vis, while tender twilight hours
 Went softly by us, treading as on flowers.
 Then suddenly I saw within the room
 The old love, long since lying in its tomb.
 It dropped the cerecloth from its fleshless face
 And smiled on me, with a remembered grace
 That, like the noontide, lit the gloaming's gloom.

 Upon its shroud there hung the grave's green mould,
 About it hung the odor of the dead;
 Yet from its cavernous eyes such light was shed
 That all my life seemed gilded, as with gold;
 Unto the trembling new love '"Go," I said
 "I do not need thee, for I have the old."
