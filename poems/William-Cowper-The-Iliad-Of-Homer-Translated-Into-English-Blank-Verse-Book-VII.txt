 Argument Of The Seventh Book.


Ajax and Hector engage in single combat. The Grecians fortify their camp.



 So saying, illustrious Hector through the gates
 To battle rush'd, with Paris at his side,
 And both were bent on deeds of high renown.
 As when the Gods vouchsafe propitious gales
 To longing mariners, who with smooth oars
 Threshing the waves have all their strength consumed,
 So them the longing Trojans glad received.
 At once each slew a Grecian. Paris slew
 Menesthius who in Arna dwelt, the son
 Of Areitho�s, club-bearing chief,
 And of Philomedusa radiant-eyed.
 But Hector wounded with his glittering spear
 E�oneus; he pierced his neck beneath
 His brazen morion's verge, and dead he fell.
 Then Glaucus, leader of the Lycian host,
 Son of Hippolochus, in furious fight
 Iphino�s son of Dexias assail'd,
 Mounting his rapid mares, and with his lance
 His shoulder pierced; unhorsed he fell and died.
 Such slaughter of the Grecians in fierce fight
 Minerva noting, from the Olympian hills
 Flew down to sacred Ilium; whose approach
 Marking from Pergamus, Apollo flew
 To meet her, ardent on the part of Troy.
 Beneath the beech they join'd, when first the King,
 The son of Jove, Apollo thus began.
 Daughter of Jove supreme! why hast thou left
 Olympus, and with such impetuous speed?
 Comest thou to give the Dana� success
 Decisive? For I know that pity none
 Thou feel'st for Trojans, perish as they may
 But if advice of mine can influence thee
 To that which shall be best, let us compose
 This day the furious fight which shall again
 Hereafter rage, till Ilium be destroy'd.
 Since such is Juno's pleasure and thy own.
 Him answer'd then Pallas c�rulean-eyed.
 Celestial archer! be it so. I came
 Myself so purposing into the field
 From the Olympian heights. But by what means
 Wilt thou induce the warriors to a pause?
 To whom the King, the son of Jove, replied.
 The courage of equestrian Hector bold
 Let us excite, that he may challenge forth
 To single conflict terrible some chief
 Achaian. The Achaians brazen-mail'd
 Indignant, will supply a champion soon
 To combat with the noble Chief of Troy.
 So spake Apollo, and his counsel pleased
 Minerva; which when Helenus the seer,
 Priam's own son, in his prophetic soul
 Perceived, approaching Hector, thus he spake.
 Jove's peer in wisdom, Hector, Priam's son!
 I am thy brother. Wilt thou list to me?
 Bid cease the battle. Bid both armies sit.
 Call first, thyself, the mightiest of the Greeks
 To single conflict. I have heard the voice
 Of the Eternal Gods, and well-assured
 Foretell thee that thy death not now impends.
 He spake, whom Hector heard with joy elate.
 Before his van striding into the space
 Both hosts between, he with his spear transverse[1]
 Press'd back the Trojans, and they sat. Down sat
 The well-greaved Grecians also at command
 Of Agamemnon; and in shape assumed
 Of vultures, Pallas and Apollo perch'd
 High on the lofty beech sacred to Jove
 The father �gis-arm'd; delighted thence
 They view'd the peopled plain horrent around
 With shields and helms and glittering spears erect.
 As when fresh-blowing Zephyrus the flood
 Sweeps first, the ocean blackens at the blast,
 Such seem'd the plain whereon the Achaians sat
 And Trojans, whom between thus Hector spake.
 Ye Trojans and Achaians brazen-greaved,
 Attend while I shall speak! Jove high-enthroned
 Hath not fulfill'd the truce, but evil plans
 Against both hosts, till either ye shall take
 Troy's lofty towers, or shall yourselves in flight
 Fall vanquish'd at your billow-cleaving barks.
 With you is all the flower of Greece.[2] Let him
 Whose heart shall move him to encounter sole
 Illustrious Hector, from among you all
 Stand forth, and Jove be witness to us both.
 If he, with his long-pointed lance, of life
 Shall me bereave, my armor is his prize,
 Which he shall hence into your fleet convey;
 Not so my body; that he shall resign
 For burial to the men and wives of Troy.
 But if Apollo make the glory mine,
 And he fall vanquish'd, him will I despoil,
 And hence conveying into sacred Troy
 His arms, will in the temple hang them high[3]
 Of the bow-bender God, but I will send
 His body to the fleet, that him the Greeks
 May grace with rights funereal. On the banks
 Of wide-spread Hellespont ye shall upraise
 His tomb, and as they cleave with oary barks
 The sable deep, posterity shall say--
 "It is a warrior's tomb; in ancient days
 The Hero died; him warlike Hector slew."
 So men shall speak hereafter, and my fame
 Who slew him, and my praise, shall never die.
 He ceased, and all sat mute. His challenge bold
 None dared accept, which yet they blush'd to shun,
 Till Menelaus, at the last, arose
 Groaning profound, and thus reproach'd the Greeks.
 Ah boasters! henceforth women--men no more--
 Eternal shame, shame infinite is ours,
 If none of all the Grecians dares contend
 With Hector. Dastards--deaf to glory's call--
 Rot where ye sit! I will myself take arms
 Against him, for the gods alone dispose,
 At their own pleasure, the events of war.
 He ended, and put on his radiant arms.
 Then, Menelaus, manifest appear'd
 Thy death approaching by the dreadful hands
 Of Hector, mightier far in arms than thou,
 But that the Chiefs of the Achaians all
 Upstarting stay'd thee, and himself the King,
 The son of Atreus, on thy better hand
 Seizing affectionate, thee thus address'd.
 Thou ravest, my royal brother! and art seized
 With needless frenzy. But, however chafed,
 Restrain thy wrath, nor covet to contend
 With Priameian Hector, whom in fight
 All dread, a warrior thy superior far.
 Not even Achilles, in the glorious field
 (Though stronger far than thou) this hero meets
 Undaunted. Go then, and thy seat resume
 In thy own band; the Achaians shall for him,
 Doubtless, some fitter champion furnish forth.
 Brave though he be, and with the toils of war
 Insatiable, he shall be willing yet,
 Seated on his bent knees, to breathe a while,
 Should he escape the arduous brunt severe.
 So saying, the hero by his counsel wise
 His brother's purpose alter'd; he complied,
 And his glad servants eased him of his arms.
 Then Nestor thus the Argive host bespake.
 Great wo, ye Gods! hath on Achaia fallen.
 Now may the warlike Pelaus, hoary Chief,
 Who both with eloquence and wisdom rules
 The Myrmidons, our foul disgrace deplore.
 With him discoursing, erst, of ancient times,
 When all your pedigrees I traced, I made
 His heart bound in him at the proud report.
 But now, when he shall learn how here we sat
 Cowering at the foot of Hector, he shall oft
 His hands uplift to the immortal Gods,
 Praying a swift release into the shades.
 Jove! Pallas! Phoebus! Oh that I were young
 As when the Pylians in fierce fight engaged
 The Arcadians spear-expert, beside the stream
 Of rapid Celadon! Beneath the walls
 We fought of Pheia, where the Jardan rolls.
 There Ereuthalion, Chief of godlike form,
 Stood forth before his van, and with loud voice
 Defied the Pylians. Arm'd he was in steel
 By royal Are�thous whilom worn;
 Brave Are�thous, Corynetes[4] named
 By every tongue; for that in bow and spear
 Nought trusted he, but with an iron mace
 The close-embattled phalanx shatter'd wide.
 Him by address, not by superior force,
 Lycurgus vanquish'd, in a narrow pass,
 Where him his iron whirl-bat[5] nought avail'd.
 Lycurgus stealing on him, with his lance
 Transpierced and fix'd him to the soil supine.
 Him of his arms, bright gift of brazen Mars,
 He stripp'd, which after, in the embattled field
 Lycurgus wore himself, but, growing old,
 Surrender'd them to Ereuthalion's use
 His armor-bearer, high in his esteem,
 And Ereuthalion wore them on the day
 When he defied our best. All hung their heads
 And trembled; none dared meet him; till at last
 With inborn courage warm'd, and nought dismayed,
 Though youngest of them all, I undertook
 That contest, and, by Pallas' aid, prevail'd.
 I slew the man in height and bulk all men
 Surpassing, and much soil he cover'd slain.
 Oh for the vigor of those better days!
 Then should not Hector want a champion long,
 Whose call to combat, ye, although the prime
 And pride of all our land, seem slow to hear.
 He spake reproachful, when at once arose
 Nine heroes. Agamemnon, King of men,
 Foremost arose; then Tydeus' mighty son,
 With either Ajax in fierce prowess clad;
 The Cretan next, Idomeneus, with whom
 Uprose Meriones his friend approved,
 Terrible as the man-destroyer Mars.
 Ev�mon's noble offspring next appear'd
 Eurypylus; Andr�mon's son the next
 Thoas; and last, Ulysses, glorious Chief.
 All these stood ready to engage in arms
 With warlike Hector, when the ancient King,
 Gerenian Nestor, thus his speech resumed.
 Now cast the lot for all. Who wins the chance
 Shall yield Achaia service, and himself
 Serve also, if successful he escape
 This brunt of hostile hardiment severe.
 So Nestor. They, inscribing each his lot,
 Into the helmet cast it of the son
 Of Atreus, Agamemnon. Then the host
 Pray'd all, their hands uplifting, and with eyes
 To the wide heavens directed, many said[6]--
 Eternal sire! choose Ajax, or the son
 Of Tydeus, or the King himself[7] who sways
 The sceptre in Mycen� wealth-renown'd!
 Such prayer the people made; then Nestor shook
 The helmet, and forth leaped, whose most they wished,
 The lot of Ajax. Throughout all the host
 To every chief and potentate of Greece,
 From right to left the herald bore the lot
 By all disown'd; but when at length he reach'd
 The inscriber of the lot, who cast it in,
 Illustrious Ajax, in his open palm
 The herald placed it, standing at his side.
 He, conscious, with heroic joy the lot
 Cast at his foot, and thus exclaim'd aloud.
 My friends! the lot is mine,[8] and my own heart
 Rejoices also; for I nothing doubt
 That noble Hector shall be foil'd by me.
 But while I put mine armor on, pray all
 In silence to the King Saturnian Jove,
 Lest, while ye pray, the Trojans overhear.
 Or pray aloud, for whom have we to dread?

 No man shall my firm standing by his strength
 Unsettle, or for ignorance of mine
 Me vanquish, who, I hope, brought forth and train'd
 In Salamis, have, now, not much to learn.
 He ended. They with heaven-directed eyes
 The King in prayer address'd, Saturnian Jove.
 Jove! glorious father! who from Ida's height
 Controlest all below, let Ajax prove
 Victorious; make the honor all his own!
 Or, if not less than Ajax, Hector share
 Thy love and thy regard, divide the prize
 Of glory, and let each achieve renown!
 Then Ajax put his radiant armor on,
 And, arm'd complete, rush'd forward. As huge Mars
 To battle moves the sons of men between
 Whom Jove with heart-devouring thirst inspires
 Of war, so moved huge Ajax to the fight,
 Tower of the Greeks, dilating with a smile
 His martial features terrible; on feet,
 Firm-planted, to the combat he advanced
 Stride after stride, and shook his quivering spear.
 Him viewing, Argos' universal host
 Exulted, while a panic loosed the knees
 Of every Trojan; even Hector's heart
 Beat double, but escape for him remain'd
 None now, or to retreat into his ranks
 Again, from whom himself had challenged forth.
 Ajax advancing like a tower his shield
 Sevenfold, approach'd. It was the labor'd work
 Of Tychius, armorer of matchless skill,
 Who dwelt in Hyla; coated with the hides
 Of seven high-pamper'd bulls that shield he framed
 For Ajax, and the disk plated with brass.
 Advancing it before his breast, the son
 Of Telamon approach'd the Trojan Chief,
 And face to face, him threatening, thus began.
 Now, Hector, prove, by me alone opposed,
 What Chiefs the Dana� can furnish forth
 In absence of the lion-hearted prince
 Achilles, breaker of the ranks of war.
 He, in his billow-cleaving barks incensed
 Against our leader Agamemnon, lies;
 But warriors of my measure, who may serve
 To cope with thee, we want not; numerous such
 Are found amongst us. But begin the fight.
 To whom majestic Hector fierce in arms.
 Ajax! heroic leader of the Greeks!
 Offspring of Telamon! essay not me
 With words to terrify, as I were boy.
 Or girl unskill'd in war;[9] I am a man
 Well exercised in battle, who have shed
 The blood of many a warrior, and have learn'd,
 From hand to hand shifting my shield, to fight
 Unwearied; I can make a sport of war,
 In standing fight adjusting all my steps
 To martial measures sweet, or vaulting light
 Into my chariot, thence can urge the foe.
 Yet in contention with a Chief like thee
 I will employ no stratagem, or seek
 To smite thee privily, but with a stroke
 (If I may reach thee) visible to all.
 So saying, he shook, then hurl'd his massy spear
 At Ajax, and his broad shield sevenfold
 On its eighth surface of resplendent brass
 Smote full; six hides the unblunted weapon pierced,
 But in the seventh stood rooted. Ajax, next,
 Heroic Chief, hurl'd his long shadow'd spear
 And struck the oval shield of Priam's son.
 Through his bright disk the weapon tempest-driven
 Glided, and in his hauberk-rings infixt
 At his soft flank, ripp'd wide his vest within.
 Inclined oblique he 'scaped the dreadful doom
 Then each from other's shield his massy spear
 Recovering quick, like lions hunger-pinch'd
 Or wild boars irresistible in force,
 They fell to close encounter. Priam's son
 The shield of Ajax at its centre smote,
 But fail'd to pierce it, for he bent his point.
 Sprang Ajax then, and meeting full the targe
 Of Hector, shock'd him; through it and beyond
 He urged the weapon with its sliding edge
 Athwart his neck, and blood was seen to start.
 But still, for no such cause, from battle ceased
 Crest-tossing Hector, but retiring, seized
 A huge stone angled sharp and black with age
 That on the champain lay. The bull-hide guard
 Sevenfold of Ajax with that stone he smote
 Full on its centre; sang the circling brass.
 Then Ajax far a heavier stone upheaved;
 He whirled it, and with might immeasurable
 Dismiss'd the mass, which with a mill-stone weight
 Sank through the shield of Hector, and his knees
 Disabled; with his shield supine he fell,
 But by Apollo raised, stood soon again.
 And now, with swords they had each other hewn,
 Had not the messengers of Gods and men
 The heralds wise, Id�us on the part
 Of Ilium, and Talthybius for the Greeks,
 Advancing interposed. His sceptre each
 Between them held, and thus Id�us spake.[10]
 My children, cease! prolong not still the fight.
 Ye both are dear to cloud-assembler Jove,
 Both valiant, and all know it. But the Night
 Hath fallen, and Night's command must be obeyed.
 To him the son of Telamon replied.
 Id�us! bid thy master speak as thou.
 He is the challenger. If such his choice,
 Mine differs not; I wait but to comply.
 Him answer'd then heroic Hector huge.
 Since, Ajax, the immortal powers on thee
 Have bulk pre-eminent and strength bestow'd,
 With such address in battle, that the host
 Of Greece hath not thine equal at the spear,
 Now let the combat cease. We shall not want
 More fair occasion; on some future day
 We will not part till all-disposing heaven
 Shall give thee victory, or shall make her mine.
 But Night hath fallen, and Night must be obey'd,
 That them may'st gratify with thy return
 The Achaians, and especially thy friends
 And thy own countrymen. I go, no less
 To exhilarate in Priam's royal town
 Men and robed matrons, who shall seek the Gods
 For me, with pious ceremonial due.
 But come. We will exchange, or ere we part,
 Some princely gift, that Greece and Troy may say
 Hereafter, with soul-wasting rage they fought,
 But parted with the gentleness of friends.
 So saying, he with his sheath and belt a sword
 Presented bright-emboss'd, and a bright belt
 Purpureal[11] took from Ajax in return.
 Thus separated, one the Grecians sought,
 And one the Trojans; they when him they saw
 From the unconquer'd hands return'd alive
 Of Ajax, with delight their Chief received,
 And to the city led him, double joy
 Conceiving all at his unhoped escape.
 On the other side, the Grecians brazen-mail'd
 To noble Agamemnon introduced
 Exulting Ajax, and the King of men
 In honor of the conqueror slew an ox
 Of the fifth year to Jove omnipotent.
 Him flaying first, they carved him next and spread
 The whole abroad, then, scoring deep the flesh,
 They pierced it with the spits, and from the spits
 (Once roasted well) withdrew it all again.
 Their labor thus accomplish'd, and the board
 Furnish'd with plenteous cheer, they feasted all
 Till all were satisfied; nor Ajax miss'd
 The conqueror's meed, to whom the hero-king
 Wide-ruling Agamemnon, gave the chine[12]
 Perpetual,[13] his distinguish'd portion due.
 The calls of hunger and of thirst at length
 Both well sufficed, thus, foremost of them all
 The ancient Nestor, whose advice had oft
 Proved salutary, prudent thus began.
 Chiefs of Achaia, and thou, chief of all,
 Great Agamemnon! Many of our host
 Lie slain, whose blood sprinkles, in battle shed,
 The banks of smooth Scamander, and their souls
 Have journey'd down into the realms of death.
 To-morrow, therefore, let the battle pause
 As need requires, and at the peep of day
 With mules and oxen, wheel ye from all parts
 The dead, that we may burn them near the fleet.
 So, home to Greece returning, will we give
 The fathers' ashes to the children's care.
 Accumulating next, the pile around,
 One common tomb for all, with brisk dispatch
 We will upbuild for more secure defence
 Of us and of our fleet, strong towers and tall
 Adjoining to the tomb, and every tower
 Shall have its ponderous gate, commodious pass
 Affording to the mounted charioteer.
 And last, without those towers and at their foot,
 Dig we a trench, which compassing around
 Our camp, both steeds and warriors shall exclude,
 And all fierce inroad of the haughty foe.
 So counsell'd he, whom every Chief approved.
 In Troy meantime, at Priam's gate beside
 The lofty citadel, debate began
 The assembled senators between, confused,
 Clamorous, and with furious heat pursued,
 When them Antenor, prudent, thus bespake.
 Ye Trojans, Dardans, and allies of Troy,
 My counsel hear! Delay not. Instant yield
 To the Atrid�, hence to be convey'd,
 Helen of Greece with all that is her own.
 For charged with violated oaths we fight,
 And hope I none conceive that aught by us
 Design'd shall prosper, unless so be done.
 He spake and sat; when from his seat arose
 Paris, fair Helen's noble paramour,
 Who thus with speech impassion'd quick replied.
 Antenor! me thy counsel hath not pleased;
 Thou could'st have framed far better; but if this
 Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods
 Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth.
 But I will speak myself. Ye Chiefs of Troy,
 I tell you plain. I will not yield my spouse.
 But all her treasures to our house convey'd
 From Argos, those will I resign, and add
 Still other compensation from my own.
 Thus Paris said and sat; when like the Gods
 Themselves in wisdom, from his seat uprose
 Dardanian Priam, who them thus address'd.
 Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!
 I shall declare my sentence; hear ye me.
 Now let the legions, as at other times,
 Take due refreshment; let the watch be set,
 And keep ye vigilant guard. At early dawn
 We will dispatch Id�us to the fleet,
 Who shall inform the Atrid� of this last
 Resolve of Paris, author of the war.
 Discreet Id�us also shall propose
 A respite (if the Atrid� so incline)
 From war's dread clamor, while we burn the dead.
 Then will we clash again, till heaven at length
 Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide.
 He ceased, whose voice the assembly pleased, obey'd.
 Then, troop by troop, the army took repast,
 And at the dawn Id�us sought the fleet.
 He found the Dana�, servants of Mars,
 Beside the stern of Agamemnon's ship
 Consulting; and amid the assembled Chiefs
 Arrived, with utterance clear them thus address'd.
 Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Chiefs, the flower
 Of all Achaia! Priam and the Chiefs
 Of Ilium, bade me to your ear impart
 (If chance such embassy might please your ear)
 The mind of Paris, author of the war.
 The treasures which on board his ships he brought
 From Argos home (oh, had he perish'd first!)
 He yields them with addition from his own.
 Not so the consort of the glorious prince
 Brave Menelaus; her (although in Troy
 All counsel otherwise) he still detains.
 Thus too I have in charge. Are ye inclined
 That the dread sounding clamors of the field
 Be caused to cease till we shall burn the dead?
 Then will we clash again, 'till heaven at length
 Shall part us, and the doubtful strife decide.
 So spake Id�us, and all silent sat;
 Till at the last brave Diomede replied.
 No. We will none of Paris' treasures now,
 Nor even Helen's self. A child may see
 Destruction winging swift her course to Troy.
 He said. The admiring Greeks with loud applause
 All praised the speech of warlike Diomede,
 And answer thus the King of men return'd.
 Id�us! thou hast witness'd the resolve
 Of the Achaian Chiefs, whose choice is mine.
 But for the slain, I shall not envy them
 A funeral pile; the spirit fled, delay
 Suits not. Last rites can not too soon be paid.
 Burn them. And let high-thundering Jove attest
 Himself mine oath, that war shall cease the while.
 So saying, he to all the Gods upraised
 His sceptre, and Id�us homeward sped
 To sacred Ilium. The Dardanians there
 And Trojans, all assembled, his return
 Expected anxious. He amid them told
 Distinct his errand, when, at once dissolved,
 The whole assembly rose, these to collect
 The scatter'd bodies, those to gather wood;
 While on the other side, the Greeks arose
 As sudden, and all issuing from the fleet
 Sought fuel, some, and some, the scatter'd dead.
 Now from the gently-swelling flood profound
 The sun arising, with his earliest rays
 In his ascent to heaven smote on the fields.
 When Greeks and Trojans met. Scarce could the slain
 Be clear distinguish'd, but they cleansed from each
 His clotted gore with water, and warm tears
 Distilling copious, heaved them to the wains.
 But wailing none was heard, for such command
 Had Priam issued; therefore heaping high
 The bodies, silent and with sorrowing hearts
 They burn'd them, and to sacred Troy return'd.
 The Grecians also, on the funeral pile
 The bodies heaping sad, burn'd them with fire
 Together, and return'd into the fleet.
 Then, ere the peep of dawn, and while the veil
 Of night, though thinner, still o'erhung the earth,
 Achaians, chosen from the rest, the pile
 Encompass'd. With a tomb (one tomb for all)
 They crown'd the spot adust, and to the tomb
 (For safety of their fleet and of themselves)
 Strong fortress added of high wall and tower,
 With solid gates affording egress thence
 Commodious to the mounted charioteer;
 Deep foss and broad they also dug without,
 And planted it with piles. So toil'd the Greeks.
 The Gods, that mighty labor, from beside
 The Thunderer's throne with admiration view'd,
 When Neptune, shaker of the shores, began.
 Eternal father! is there on the face
 Of all the boundless earth one mortal man
 Who will, in times to come, consult with heaven?
 See'st thou yon height of wall, and yon deep trench
 With which the Grecians have their fleet inclosed,
 And, careless of our blessing, hecatomb
 Or invocation have presented none?
 Far as the day-spring shoots herself abroad,
 So far the glory of this work shall spread,
 While Phoebus and myself, who, toiling hard,
 Built walls for king Laomedon, shall see
 Forgotten all the labor of our hands.
 To whom, indignant, thus high-thundering Jove.
 Oh thou, who shakest the solid earth at will,
 What hast thou spoken? An inferior power,
 A god of less sufficiency than thou,
 Might be allowed some fear from such a cause.
 Fear not. Where'er the morning shoots her beams,
 Thy glory shall be known; and when the Greeks
 Shall seek their country through the waves again,
 Then break this bulwark down, submerge it whole,
 And spreading deep with sand the spacious shore
 As at the first, leave not a trace behind.
 Such conference held the Gods; and now the sun
 Went down, and, that great work perform'd, the Greeks
 From tent to tent slaughter'd the fatted ox
 And ate their evening cheer. Meantime arrived
 Large fleet with Lemnian wine; Euneus, son
 Of Jason and Hypsipile, that fleet
 From Lemnos freighted, and had stow'd on board
 A thousand measures from the rest apart
 For the Atrid�; but the host at large
 By traffic were supplied; some barter'd brass,
 Others bright steel; some purchased wine with hides,
 These with their cattle, with their captives those,
 And the whole host prepared a glad regale.
 All night the Grecians feasted, and the host
 Of Ilium, and all night deep-planning Jove
 Portended dire calamities to both,
 Thundering tremendous!--Pale was every cheek;
 Each pour'd his goblet on the ground, nor dared
 The hardiest drink, 'till he had first perform'd
 Libation meet to the Saturnian King
 Omnipotent; then, all retiring, sought
 Their couches, and partook the gift of sleep.
