 Sunlight, moonlight,
 Twilight, starlight - 
 Gloaming at the close of day,
 And an owl calling,
 Cool dews falling
 In a wood of oak and may.

 Lantern-light, taper-light,
 Torchlight, no-light:
 Darkness at the shut of day,
 And lions roaring,
 Their wrath pouring
 In wild waste places far away.

 Elf-light, bat-light,
 Touchwood-light and toad-light,
 And the sea a shimmering gloom of grey,
 And a small face smiling
 In a dream's beguiling
 In a world of wonders far away.
