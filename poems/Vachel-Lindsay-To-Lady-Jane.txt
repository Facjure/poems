 Romance was always young.
 You come today
 Just eight years old
 With marvellous dark hair.
 Younger than Dante found you
 When you turned
 His heart into the way
 That found the heavenly stair.

 Perhaps we must be strangers.
 I confess
 My soul this hour is Dante's,
 And your care
 Should be for dolls
 Whose painted hands caress
 Your marvellous dark hair.

 Romance, with moonflower face
 And morning eyes,
 And lips whose thread of scarlet prophesies
 The canticles of a coming king unknown,
 Remember, when you join him
 On his throne,
 Even me, your far off troubadour,
 And wear
 For me some trifling rose
 Beneath your veil,
 Dying a royal death,
 Happy and pale,
 Choked by the passion,
 The wonder and the snare,
 The glory and despair
 That still will haunt and own
 Your marvellous dark hair.
