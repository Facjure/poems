title: At The Piano
---

A woman was playing,
 A man looking on;
 And the mould of her face,
 And her neck, and her hair,
 Which the rays fell upon
 Of the two candles there,
Sent him mentally straying
 In some fancy-place
 Where pain had no trace.

A cowled Apparition
 Came pushing between;
 And her notes seemed to sigh,
 And the lights to burn pale,
 As a spell numbed the scene.
 But the maid saw no bale,
And the man no monition;
 And Time laughed awry,
 And the Phantom hid nigh.
