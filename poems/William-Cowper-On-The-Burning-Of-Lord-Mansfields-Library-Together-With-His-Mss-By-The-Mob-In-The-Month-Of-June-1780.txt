title: On The Burning Of Lord Mansfield�s Library, Together With His Mss., By The Mob, In The Month Of June 1780.

So then�the Vandals of our isle,
Sworn foes to sense and law,
Have burnt to dust a nobler pile
Than ever Roman saw!


And Murray sighs o�er Pope and Swift,
And many a treasure more,
The well-judged purchase and the gift
That graced his letter�d store.


Their pages mangled, burnt, and torn,
The loss was his alone;
But ages yet to come shall mourn
The burning of his own.
