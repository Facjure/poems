title: The Woods In June.

 In the sleep-haunted gloom
Born of the slumbrous twilight in these shades,
These vast and venerable collonades,
 I welcome thee, dear June!

 And while with head reclined,
And limbs aweary with my woodland walk,
I listen to the low melodious talk
 Of leaves and singing wind,

 The merry roundelay
Of the swart ploughman, sowing summer grain,
And tinkling sheep-bell on the distant plain,
 And pastures far away,

 Come with a soft refrain,
Like a faint echo from the outer world,
While Peace sits by me with her white wings furled,
 Within my green domain.

 This is my palace, where
Great trunks are amber pillars to support
The blue roof of the vast and silent court,
 In clustered columns fair:

 And underneath, the bloom
Of water-lilies through the fragrant night
Of these dim arches spreads a perfumed light,
 Even at highest noon.

 Down dropping all day long,
With a most musical cadence in the hall,
A wandering stream lets its slow waters fall
 In twinkling rhythmic song.

 Hither the vagrant bee,
From the broad fields and sunshine all astray,
Loiters the idle hours of noon away,
 In golden dreams like me.

 And from my window frame,
This oriel window opening on the sky,
I see the white barques of the clouds drift by,
 With prows of rosy flame.

 Fantastical and strange,
Their purple sails go floating o'er the deep,
Like shadows through the summer land of sleep,
 In never ending change.

 The wild shy things which roam
The woods, and live in bough and tree and grot,
Flutter and chirp unscared, they fear me not,
 For I too am at home.

 And feel my heart in tune
With the great heart of Nature, and the voice
Of all the glad bright creatures that rejoice
 In the green woods of June.
