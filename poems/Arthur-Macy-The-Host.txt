 Between the two perplexed I go,
 A shuttlecock, tossed to and fro.
 I gaze on one, and know that she
 Is all that womankind can be;
 I seek the other, and she seems
 The perfect idol of my dreams;
 And so between the charming pair
 My heart is ever in the air.
 And yet, although it be my fate
 To hover indeterminate,
 I rest content, nor ask for more
 Than this sweet game of battledore.
