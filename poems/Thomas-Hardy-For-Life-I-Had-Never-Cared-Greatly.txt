title: For Life I Had Never Cared Greatly
---

 For Life I had never cared greatly,
 As worth a man's while;
 Peradventures unsought,
 Peradventures that finished in nought,
Had kept me from youth and through manhood till lately
 Unwon by its style.

 In earliest years - why I know not -
 I viewed it askance;
 Conditions of doubt,
 Conditions that leaked slowly out,
May haply have bent me to stand and to show not
 Much zest for its dance.

 With symphonies soft and sweet colour
 It courted me then,
 Till evasions seemed wrong,
 Till evasions gave in to its song,
And I warmed, until living aloofly loomed duller
 Than life among men.

 Anew I found nought to set eyes on,
 When, lifting its hand,
 It uncloaked a star,
 Uncloaked it from fog-damps afar,
And showed its beams burning from pole to horizon
 As bright as a brand.

 And so, the rough highway forgetting,
 I pace hill and dale
 Regarding the sky,
 Regarding the vision on high,
And thus re-illumed have no humour for letting
 My pilgrimage fail.
