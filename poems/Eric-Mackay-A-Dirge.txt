A Dirge.


I.

Art thou lonely in thy tomb?
Art thou cold in such a gloom?
Rouse thee, then, and make me room, -
 Miserere Domine!


II.

Phantoms vex thy virgin sleep,
Nameless things around thee creep,
Yet be patient, do not weep, -
 Miserere Domine!


III.

O be faithful! O be brave!
Naught shall harm thee in thy grave;
Let the restless spirits rave, -
 Miserere Domine!


IV.

When my pilgrimage is done,
When the grace of God is won,
I will come to thee, my nun, -
 Miserere Domine!


V.

Like a priest in flowing vest,
Like a pale, unbidden guest,
I will come to thee and rest, -
 Miserere Domine!
