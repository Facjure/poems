Where it was announced ten days previous that the cereus would bloom, August, 1888.


We own we felt a little curious,
To see the rare night blooming cereus,
And as if 'twas divine anointed,
It came in bloom at the time appointed,
And gorgeous too their oleander,
None 'ere saw shrub blossom grander.
