title: In Memoriam. - Mr. Normand Burr,

Editor of the "Christian Secretary" for more than twenty years, died at Hartford, December 5th, aged 59.


We knew him as a man of sterling worth,
Whose good example is a legacy
Better than gold for those he leaves behind.

--His inborn piety flowed forth in streams
Of social kindness and domestic love,
Cheering with filial warmth the parents' heart,
And making his own home a pleasant place.

--His was that self-reliant industry,
Smiling at hardship, which develops well
The energies of manhood, and lends strength
To commonwealths.

By silent messenger,
A weekly scroll, he strove to spread abroad
The stores of knowledge, and increase the fruits
Of righteousness. Hence is his loss bemoan'd
By many who had never seen his face
Here in the flesh, but thro' the links of thought
Held intimate communion.

The true life
Of virtue, is not lost to men below,
Though smitten by the frost of death it fall,--
Its quickening memory survives, to gird
On in the heavenward race, and gently guide
Where the high plaudit of the Judge is won.
