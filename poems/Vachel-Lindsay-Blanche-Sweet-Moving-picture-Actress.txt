(After seeing the reel called "Oil and Water".)



 Beauty has a throne-room
 In our humorous town,
 Spoiling its hob-goblins,
 Laughing shadows down.
 Rank musicians torture
 Ragtime ballads vile,
 But we walk serenely
 Down the odorous aisle.
 We forgive the squalor
 And the boom and squeal
 For the Great Queen flashes
 From the moving reel.

 Just a prim blonde stranger
 In her early day,
 Hiding brilliant weapons,
 Too averse to play,
 Then she burst upon us
 Dancing through the night.
 Oh, her maiden radiance,
 Veils and roses white.
 With new powers, yet cautious,
 Not too smart or skilled,
 That first flash of dancing
 Wrought the thing she willed: - 
 Mobs of us made noble
 By her strong desire,
 By her white, uplifting,
 Royal romance-fire.

 Though the tin piano
 Snarls its tango rude,
 Though the chairs are shaky
 And the dramas crude,
 Solemn are her motions,
 Stately are her wiles,
 Filling oafs with wisdom,
 Saving souls with smiles;
 'Mid the restless actors
 She is rich and slow.
 She will stand like marble,
 She will pause and glow,
 Though the film is twitching,
 Keep a peaceful reign,
 Ruler of her passion,
 Ruler of our pain!
