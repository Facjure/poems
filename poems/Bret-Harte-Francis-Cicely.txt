Cicely says you�re a poet; maybe, I ain�t much on rhyme:
I reckon you�d give me a hundred, and beat me every time.
Poetry! that�s the way some chaps puts up an idee,
But I takes mine �straight without sugar,� and that�s what�s the matter with me.

Poetry! just look round you, alkali, rock, and sage;
Sage-brush, rock, and alkali; ain�t it a pretty page!
Sun in the east at mornin�, sun in the west at night,
And the shadow of this �yer station the on�y thing moves in sight.

Poetry! Well now Polly! Polly, run to your mam;
Run right away, my pooty! By-by! Ain�t she a lamb?
Poetry! that reminds me o� suthin� right in that suit:
Jest shet that door thar, will yer? for Cicely�s ears is cute.

Ye noticed Polly, the baby? A month afore she was born,
Cicely my old woman was moody-like and forlorn;
Out of her head and crazy, and talked of flowers and trees;
Family man yourself, sir? Well, you know what a woman be�s.

Narvous she was, and restless, said that she �couldn�t stay.�
Stay! and the nearest woman seventeen miles away.
But I fixed it up with the doctor, and he said he would be on hand,
And I kinder stuck by the shanty, and fenced in that bit o� land.

One night, the tenth of October, I woke with a chill and a fright,
For the door it was standing open, and Cicely warn�t in sight,
But a note was pinned on the blanket, which it said that she �couldn�t stay,�
But had gone to visit her neighbor, seventeen miles away!

When and how she stampeded, I didn�t wait for to see,
For out in the road, next minit, I started as wild as she;
Running first this way and that way, like a hound that is off the scent,
For there warn�t no track in the darkness to tell me the way she went.

I�ve had some mighty mean moments afore I kem to this spot,
Lost on the Plains in �50, drownded almost and shot;
But out on this alkali desert, a-hunting a crazy wife,
Was ra�ly as on-satis-factory as anything in my life.

�Cicely! Cicely! Cicely!� I called, and I held my breath,
And �Cicely!� came from the canyon, and all was as still as death.
And �Cicely! Cicely! Cicely!� came from the rocks below,
And jest but a whisper of �Cicely!� down from them peaks of snow.

I ain�t what you call religious, but I jest looked up to the sky,
And this �yer�s to what I�m coming, and maybe ye think I lie:
But up away to the east�ard, yaller and big and far,
I saw of a suddent rising the singlerist kind of star.

Big and yaller and dancing, it seemed to beckon to me:
Yaller and big and dancing, such as you never see:
Big and yaller and dancing, I never saw such a star,
And I thought of them sharps in the Bible, and I went for it then and thar.

Over the brush and bowlders I stumbled and pushed ahead,
Keeping the star afore me, I went wherever it led.
It might hev been for an hour, when suddent and peart and nigh,
Out of the yearth afore me thar riz up a baby�s cry.

Listen! thar�s the same music; but her lungs they are stronger now
Than the day I packed her and her mother, I�m derned if I jest know how.
But the doctor kem the next minit, and the joke o� the whole thing is
That Cis never knew what happened from that very night to this!

But Cicely says you�re a poet, and maybe you might, some day,
Jest sling her a rhyme �bout a baby that was born in a curious way,
And see what she says; and, old fellow, when you speak of the star, don�t tell
As how �twas the doctor�s lantern, for maybe �twon�t sound so well.
