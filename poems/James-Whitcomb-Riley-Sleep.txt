Orphaned, I cry to thee:
Sweet sleep!O kneel and be
A mother unto me!
Calm thou my childish fears:
Fold - fold mine eyelids to, all tenderly,
And dry my tears.

Come, Sleep, all drowsy-eyed
And faint with languor, - slide
Thy dim face down beside
Mine own, and let me rest
And nestle in thy heart, and there abide,
A favored guest.

Good night to every care,
And shadow of despair!
Good night to all things where
Within is no delight! - 
Sleep opens her dark arms, and, swooning there,
I sob: Good night - good night!
