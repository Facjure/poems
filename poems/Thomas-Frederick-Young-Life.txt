"What is life?" I asked a lad,
 As on with joyful bound,
He went to join the merry troop,
 Upon the cricket ground.

He paus'd at once with pleasant look,
 This bright-ey'd, laughing boy,
"Why, life," said he, "is sport and mirth;
 With me 'tis mostly joy.

"The tasks which I receive at school,
 I feel to be unkind;
But when I get my ball and bat,
 I drive them from my mind.

"With other boys I run and shout,
 I throw and catch the ball,
Oh, life is a right jolly thing,
 To take it all in all."

"And what is life?" I asked a maid,
 Who trod, as if on air,
So lightly she did trip along,
 So bright she look'd, and fair.

The maiden stopp'd her graceful steps,
 And to my words replied,
"Oh, life's a lovely dream," she said,
 With some slight boons denied.

"But love, and health, and beauty crowns
 My lot so filled with cheer,
That joy beams forth from ev'rything,
 To favor'd mortals here.

"The birds and flow'rs are fill'd with joy,
 With joy the birds do sing;
The very rain that comes from heav'n,
 Seems loads of joy to bring.

"And when I look to future years,
 The view seems brighter still,
And brighter grow the perfum'd flow'rs,
 As I go up the hill."

"And what is life?" I asked a man,
 A man of middle years.
"This world is truly call'd," he said,
 "A vale of bitter tears.

"I thought this earth a bright, fair spot,
 But that was long ago;
I view it now, with truer sight,
 And see a world of woe.

"With disappointment and regret,
 And hopes thrown to the ground,
I live, but with an aching heart
 I tread life's weary round."

"And what is life?" This time a man
 With hoary hair replied:
"This life consists of gracious boons,
 With evils by their side.

"To leave the bad, and choose the good,
 Is done but by the few,
And that is why mankind are such
 A discontented crew.

"With greed, the pleasure now is grasp'd,
 Or what they deem is so,
Not thinking that each pleasure now,
 May bring a future woe.

"My son, take heed to what I say,
 And see thou mark it well,
All earthly joys, too much indulg'd
 Will lead you down to hell.

"For Heaven's sake, I pray you now
 To curb your youthful will,
Nor give your headstrong passions play,
 To use their deadly skill.

"There's joy, my son, all through this life,
 To meet, as well as woe,
And if mankind would act aright,
 Much more of it they'd know.

"With prudence, virtue, for your friends,
 And caution by your side,
And faith in God's o'erruling pow'r,
 Your life will calmly glide.

"Content to bear the ills you meet,
 Mix'd always with your joy,
For human prudence can't avert
 Some woes, which still annoy.

"Pray that your mind be strong and clear,
 And vigorous your frame,
Your heart inspir'd with love and fear
 For your Creator's name."
