Tal me not, yu knocking fallers,
 Life ban only empty dream;
Dar ban planty fun, ay tal yu,
 Ef yu try Yohn Yohnson's scheme.
Yohn ban yust a section foreman,
 Vorking hard vay up on Soo;
He ban yust so glad in morning
 As ven all his vork ban tru.

"Vork," say Yohn, "ban vat yu mak it.
 Ef yu tenk yure vork ban hard,
Yu skol having planty headaches, - 
 Yes, yu bet yure life, old pard;
But ay alvays yerk my coat off,
 Grab my shovel and my pick,
And dis yob ant seem lak hard von
 Ef ay du it purty qvick."

Yohn ban foreman over fallers.
 He ant have to vork, yu see;
But, yu bet, he ant no loafer,
 And he yust digs in, by yee!
"Listen, Olaf," he skol tal me,
 "Making living ant no trick.
And the hardest yob ban easy
 Ef yu only du it qvick!"

"Let us den be op and yumping,
 Always glad to plow tru drift;
Ven our vork ban done, den let us
 Give some oder faller lift.
Den, ay bet yu, old Saint Peter,
 He skol tenk ve're purty slick;
Ve can go tru gates, ay bet yu,
 Ef ve only du it qvick!"
