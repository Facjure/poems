title: The Dog And The Water Lily. No Fable.

The noon was shady, and soft airs
Swept Ouse�s silent tide,
When, �scaped from literary cares,
I wander�d on his side.


My spaniel, prettiest of his race,
And high in pedigree
(Two nymphs[1] adorn�d with every grace
That spaniel found for me),


Now wanton�d lost in flags and reeds,
Now starting into sight,
Pursued the swallow o�er the meads
With scarce a slower flight.


It was the time when Ouse display�d
His lilies newly blown;
Their beauties I intent survey�d,
And one I wish�d my own.


With cane extended far I sought
To steer it close to land;
But still the prize, though nearly caught,
Escaped my eager hand.


Beau mark�d my unsuccessful pains
With fix�d considerate face,
And puzzling set his puppy brains
To comprehend the case.


But with a cherup clear and strong
Dispersing all his dream,
I thence withdrew, and follow�d long
The windings of the stream.


My ramble ended, I return�d;
Beau, trotting far before,
The floating wreath again discern�d,
And plunging, left the shore.


I saw him with that lily cropp�d
Impatient swim to meet
My quick approach, and soon he dropp�d
The treasure at my feet.


Charm�d with the sight, the world, I cried,
Shall hear of this thy deed:
My dog shall mortify the pride
Of man�s superior breed:


But chief myself I will enjoin,
Awake at duty�s call,
To show a love as prompt as thine
To Him who gives me all.
