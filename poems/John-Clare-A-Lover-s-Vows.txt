title: A Lover's Vows
---

 Scenes of love and days of pleasure,
 I must leave them all, lassie.
 Scenes of love and hours of leisure,
 All are gone for aye, lassie.
 No more thy velvet-bordered dress
 My fond and longing een shall bless,
 Thou lily in the wilderness;
 And who shall love thee then, lassie?
 Long I've watched thy look so tender,
 Often clasped thy waist so slender:
 Heaven, in thine own love defend her,
 God protect my own lassie.

 By all the faith I've shown afore thee,
 I'll swear by more than that, lassie:
 By heaven and earth I'll still adore thee,
 Though we should part for aye, lassie!
 By thy infant years so loving,
 By thy woman's love so moving,
 That white breast thy goodness proving,
 I'm thine for aye, through all, lassie!
 By the sun that shines for ever,
 By love's light and its own Giver,
 Who loveth truth and leaveth never,
 I'm thine for aye, through all, lassie!
