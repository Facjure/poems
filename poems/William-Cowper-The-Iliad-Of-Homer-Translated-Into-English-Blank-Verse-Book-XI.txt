 Argument Of The Eleventh Book.


Agamemnon distinguishes himself. He is wounded, and retires. Diomede is wounded by Paris; Ulysses by Socus. Ajax with Menelaus flies to the relief of Ulysses, and Eurypylus, soon after, to the relief of Ajax. While he is employed in assisting Ajax, he is shot in the thigh by Paris, who also wounds Machaon. Nestor conveys Machaon from the field. Achilles dispatches Patroclus to the tent of Nestor, and Nestor takes that occasion to exhort Patroclus to engage in battle, clothed in the armor of Achilles.



 Aurora from Tithonus' side arose
 With light for heaven and earth, when Jove dispatch'd
 Discord, the fiery signal in her hand
 Of battle bearing, to the Grecian fleet.
 High on Ulysses' huge black ship she stood
 The centre of the fleet, whence all might hear,
 The tent of Telamon's huge son between,
 And of Achilles; for confiding they
 In their heroic fortitude, their barks
 Well-poised had station'd utmost of the line.
 There standing, shrill she sent a cry abroad
 Among the Achaians, such as thirst infused
 Of battle ceaseless into every breast.
 All deem'd, at once, war sweeter, than to seek
 Their native country through the waves again.
 Then with loud voice Atrides bade the Greeks
 Gird on their armor, and himself his arms
 Took radiant. First around his legs he clasp'd
 His shining greaves with silver studs secured,
 Then bound his corselet to his bosom, gift
 Of Cynyras long since;[1] for rumor loud
 Had Cyprus reached of an Achaian host
 Assembling, destined to the shores of Troy:
 Wherefore, to gratify the King of men,
 He made the splendid ornament his own.
 Ten rods of steel coerulean all around
 Embraced it, twelve of gold, twenty of tin;
 Six[2] spiry serpents their uplifted heads
 Coerulean darted at the wearer's throat,
 Splendor diffusing as the various bow
 Fix'd by Saturnian Jove in showery clouds,
 A sign to mortal men.[3] He slung his sword
 Athwart his shoulders; dazzling bright it shone
 With gold emboss'd, and silver was the sheath
 Suspended graceful in a belt of gold.
 His massy shield o'ershadowing him whole,
 High-wrought and beautiful, he next assumed.
 Ten circles bright of brass around its field
 Extensive, circle within circle, ran;
 The central boss was black, but hemm'd about
 With twice ten bosses of resplendent tin.
 There, dreadful ornament! the visage dark
 Of Gorgon scowl'd, border'd by Flight and Fear.
 The loop was silver, and a serpent form
 Coerulean over all its surface twined,
 Three heads erecting on one neck, the heads
 Together wreath'd into a stately crown.
 His helmet qu�tre-crested,[4] and with studs
 Fast riveted around he to his brows
 Adjusted, whence tremendous waved his crest
 Of mounted hair on high. Two spears he seized
 Ponderous, brass-pointed, and that flash'd to heaven.
 Sounds[5] like clear thunder, by the spouse of Jove
 And by Minerva raised to extol the King
 Of opulent Mycen�, roll'd around.
 At once each bade his charioteer his steeds
 Hold fast beside the margin of the trench
 In orderly array; the foot all arm'd
 Rush'd forward, and the clamor of the host
 Rose infinite into the dawning skies.
 First, at the trench, the embattled infantry[6]
 Stood ranged; the chariots follow'd close behind;
 Dire was the tumult by Saturnian Jove
 Excited, and from ether down he shed
 Blood-tinctured dews among them, for he meant
 That day to send full many a warrior bold
 To Pluto's dreary realm, slain premature.
 Opposite, on the rising-ground, appear'd
 The Trojans; them majestic Hector led,
 Noble Polydamas, �neas raised
 To godlike honors in all Trojan hearts,
 And Polybus, with whom Antenor's sons
 Agenor, and young Acamas advanced.
 Hector the splendid orb of his broad shield
 Bore in the van, and as a comet now
 Glares through the clouds portentous, and again,
 Obscured by gloomy vapors, disappears,
 So Hector, marshalling his host, in front
 Now shone, now vanish'd in the distant rear.
 All-cased he flamed in brass, and on the sight
 Flash'd as the lightnings of Jove �gis-arm'd.
 As reapers, toiling opposite,[7] lay bare
 Some rich man's furrows, while the sever'd grain,
 Barley or wheat, sinks as the sickle moves,
 So Greeks and Trojans springing into fight
 Slew mutual; foul retreat alike they scorn'd,
 Alike in fierce hostility their heads
 Both bore aloft, and rush'd like wolves to war.
 Discord, spectatress terrible, that sight
 Beheld exulting; she, of all the Gods,
 Alone was present; not a Power beside
 There interfered, but each his bright abode
 Quiescent occupied wherever built
 Among the windings of the Olympian heights;
 Yet blamed they all the storm-assembler King
 Saturnian, for his purposed aid to Troy.
 The eternal father reck'd not; he, apart,
 Seated in solitary pomp, enjoy'd
 His glory, and from on high the towers survey'd
 Of Ilium and the fleet of Greece, the flash
 Of gleaming arms, the slayer and the slain.
 While morning lasted, and the light of day
 Increased, so long the weapons on both sides
 Flew in thick vollies, and the people fell.
 But, what time his repast the woodman spreads
 In some umbrageous vale, his sinewy arms
 Wearied with hewing many a lofty tree,
 And his wants satisfied, he feels at length
 The pinch of appetite to pleasant food,[8]
 Then was it, that encouraging aloud
 Each other, in their native virtue strong,
 The Grecians through the phalanx burst of Troy.
 Forth sprang the monarch first; he slew the Chief
 Bianor, nor himself alone, but slew
 O�leus also driver of his steeds.
 O�leus, with a leap alighting, rush'd
 On Agamemnon; he his fierce assault
 Encountering, with a spear met full his front.
 Nor could his helmet's ponderous brass sustain
 That force, but both his helmet and his skull
 It shatter'd, and his martial rage repress'd.
 The King of men, stripping their corselets, bared
 Their shining breasts, and left them. Isus, next,
 And Antiphus he flew to slay, the sons
 Of Priam both, and in one chariot borne,
 This spurious, genuine that. The bastard drove,
 And Antiphus, a warrior high-renown'd,
 Fought from the chariot; them Achilles erst
 Feeding their flocks on Ida had surprised
 And bound with osiers, but for ransom loosed.
 Of these, imperial Agamemnon, first,
 Above the pap pierced Isus; next, he smote
 Antiphus with his sword beside the ear,
 And from his chariot cast him to the ground.
 Conscious of both, their glittering arms he stripp'd,
 For he had seen them when from Ida's heights
 Achilles led them to the Grecian fleet.
 As with resistless fangs the lion breaks
 The young in pieces of the nimble hind,
 Entering her lair, and takes their feeble lives;
 She, though at hand, can yield them no defence,
 But through the thick wood, wing'd with terror, starts
 Herself away, trembling at such a foe;
 So them the Trojans had no power to save,
 Themselves all driven before the host of Greece.
 Next, on Pisandrus, and of dauntless heart
 Hippolochus he rush'd; they were the sons
 Of brave Antimachus, who with rich gifts
 By Paris bought, inflexible withheld
 From Menelaus still his lovely bride.
 His sons, the monarch, in one chariot borne
 Encounter'd; they (for they had lost the reins)
 With trepidation and united force
 Essay'd to check the steeds; astonishment
 Seized both; Atrides with a lion's rage
 Came on, and from the chariot thus they sued.
 Oh spare us! son of Atreus, and accept
 Ransom immense. Antimachus our sire
 Is rich in various treasure, gold and brass,
 And temper'd steel, and, hearing the report
 That in Achaia's fleet his sons survive,
 He will requite thee with a glorious price.
 So they, with tears and gentle terms the King
 Accosted, but no gentle answer heard.
 Are ye indeed the offspring of the Chief
 Antimachus, who when my brother once

 With godlike Laertiades your town
 Enter'd ambassador, his death advised
 In council, and to let him forth no more?
 Now rue ye both the baseness of your sire.
 He said, and from his chariot to the plain
 Thrust down Pisandrus, piercing with keen lance
 His bosom, and supine he smote the field.
 Down leap'd Hippolochus, whom on the ground
 He slew, cut sheer his hands, and lopp'd his head,
 And roll'd it like a mortar[9] through the ranks.
 He left the slain, and where he saw the field
 With thickest battle cover'd, thither flew
 By all the Grecians follow'd bright in arms.
 The scatter'd infantry constrained to fly,
 Fell by the infantry; the charioteers,
 While with loud hoofs their steeds the dusty soil
 Excited, o'er the charioteers their wheels
 Drove brazen-fellied, and the King of men
 Incessant slaughtering, called his Argives[10] on.
 As when fierce flames some ancient forest seize,
 From side to side in flakes the various wind
 Rolls them, and to the roots devour'd, the trunks
 Fall prostrate under fury of the fire,
 So under Agamemnon fell the heads
 Of flying Trojans. Many a courser proud
 The empty chariots through the paths of war
 Whirl'd rattling, of their charioteers deprived;
 They breathless press'd the plain, now fitter far
 To feed the vultures than to cheer their wives.
 Conceal'd, meantime, by Jove, Hector escaped
 The dust, darts, deaths, and tumult of the field;
 And Agamemnon to the swift pursuit
 Call'd loud the Grecians. Through the middle plain
 Beside the sepulchre of Ilus, son
 Of Dardanus, and where the fig-tree stood,
 The Trojans flew, panting to gain the town,
 While Agamemnon pressing close the rear,
 Shout after shout terrific sent abroad,
 And his victorious hands reek'd, red with gore.
 But at the beech-tree and the Sc�an gate
 Arrived, the Trojans halted, waiting there
 The rearmost fugitives; they o'er the field
 Came like a herd, which in the dead of night
 A lion drives; all fly, but one is doom'd
 To death inevitable; her with jaws
 True to their hold he seizes, and her neck
 Breaking, embowels her, and laps the blood;
 So, Atreus' royal son, the hindmost still
 Slaying, and still pursuing, urged them on.
 Many supine, and many prone, the field
 Press'd, by the son of Atreus in their flight
 Dismounted; for no weapon raged as his.
 But now, at last, when he should soon have reach'd
 The lofty walls of Ilium, came the Sire
 Of Gods and men descending from the skies,
 And on the heights of Ida fountain-fed,
 Sat arm'd with thunders. Calling to his foot
 Swift Iris golden-pinion'd, thus he spake.
 Iris! away. Thus speak in Hector's ears.
 While yet he shall the son of Atreus see
 Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down
 The Trojan ranks, so long let him abstain
 From battle, leaving to his host the task
 Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.
 But soon as Atreus' son by spear or shaft
 Wounded shall climb his chariot, with such force
 I will endue Hector, that he shall slay
 Till he have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun
 Descending, sacred darkness cover all.
 He spake, nor rapid Iris disobey'd
 Storm-wing'd ambassadress, but from the heights
 Of Ida stoop'd to Ilium. There she found
 The son of royal Priam by the throng
 Of chariots and of steeds compass'd about
 She, standing at his side, him thus bespake.
 Oh, son of Priam! as the Gods discreet!
 I bring thee counsel from the Sire of all.
 While yet thou shalt the son of Atreus see
 Fierce warring in the van, and mowing down
 The warrior ranks, so long he bids thee pause
 From battle, leaving to thy host the task
 Of bloody contest furious with the Greeks.
 But soon as Atreus' son, by spear or shaft
 Wounded, shall climb his chariot, Jove will then
 Endue thee with such force, that thou shalt slay
 Till thou have reach'd the ships, and till, the sun
 Descending, sacred darkness cover all.
 So saying, swift-pinion'd Iris disappear'd.
 Then Hector from his chariot at a leap
 Came down all arm'd, and, shaking his bright spears,
 Ranged every quarter, animating loud
 The legions, and rekindling horrid war.
 Back roll'd the Trojan ranks, and faced the Greeks;
 The Greeks their host to closer phalanx drew;
 The battle was restored, van fronting van
 They stood, and Agamemnon into fight
 Sprang foremost, panting for superior fame.
 Say now, ye Nine, who on Olympus dwell!
 What Trojan first, or what ally of Troy
 Opposed the force of Agamemnon's arm?
 Iphidamas, Antenor's valiant son,
 Of loftiest stature, who in fertile Thrace
 Mother of flocks was nourish'd, Cisseus him
 His grandsire, father of Theano praised
 For loveliest features, in his own abode
 Rear'd yet a child, and when at length he reach'd
 The measure of his glorious manhood firm
 Dismiss'd him not, but, to engage him more,
 Gave him his daughter. Wedded, he his bride
 As soon deserted, and with galleys twelve
 Following the rumor'd voyage of the Greeks,
 The same course steer'd; but at Percope moor'd,
 And marching thence, arrived on foot at Troy.
 He first opposed Atrides. They approach'd.
 The spear of Agamemnon wander'd wide;
 But him Iphidamas on his broad belt
 Beneath the corselet struck, and, bearing still
 On his spear-beam, enforced it; but ere yet
 He pierced the broider'd zone, his point, impress'd
 Against the silver, turn'd, obtuse as lead.
 Then royal Agamemnon in his hand
 The weapon grasping, with a lion's rage
 Home drew it to himself, and from his gripe
 Wresting it, with his falchion keen his neck
 Smote full, and stretch'd him lifeless at his foot.
 So slept Iphidamas among the slain;
 Unhappy! from his virgin bride remote,
 Associate with the men of Troy in arms
 He fell, and left her beauties unenjoy'd.
 He gave her much, gave her a hundred beeves,
 And sheep and goats a thousand from his flocks
 Promised, for numberless his meadows ranged;
 But Agamemnon, son of Atreus, him
 Slew and despoil'd, and through the Grecian host
 Proceeded, laden with his gorgeous arms.
 Co�n that sight beheld, illustrious Chief,
 Antenor's eldest born, but with dim eyes
 Through anguish for his brother's fall. Unseen
 Of noble Agamemnon, at his side
 He cautious stood, and with a spear his arm,
 Where thickest flesh'd, below his elbow, pierced,
 Till opposite the glittering point appear'd.
 A thrilling horror seized the King of men
 So wounded; yet though wounded so, from fight
 He ceased not, but on Co�n rush'd, his spear
 Grasping, well-thriven growth[11] of many a wind.
 He by the foot drew off Iphidamas,
 His brother, son of his own sire, aloud
 Calling the Trojan leaders to his aid;
 When him so occupied with his keen point
 Atrides pierced his bossy shield beneath.
 Expiring on Iphidamas he fell
 Prostrate, and Agamemnon lopp'd his head.
 Thus, under royal Agamemnon's hand,
 Antenor's sons their destiny fulfill'd,
 And to the house of Ades journey'd both.
 Through other ranks of warriors then he pass'd,
 Now with his spear, now with his falchion arm'd,
 And now with missile force of massy stones,
 While yet his warm blood sallied from the wound.
 But when the wound grew dry, and the blood ceased,
 Anguish intolerable undermined
 Then all the might of Atreus' royal son.
 As when a laboring woman's arrowy throes
 Seize her intense, by Juno's daughters dread
 The birth-presiding Ilithy� deep
 Infixt, dispensers of those pangs severe;
 So, anguish insupportable subdued
 Then all the might of Atreus' royal son.
 Up-springing to his seat, instant he bade
 His charioteer drive to the hollow barks,
 Heart-sick himself with pain; yet, ere he went,
 With voice loud-echoing hail'd the Dana�.
 Friends! counsellors and leaders of the Greeks!
 Now drive, yourselves, the battle from your ships.
 For me the Gods permit not to employ
 In fight with Ilium's host the day entire.
 He ended, and the charioteer his steeds
 Lash'd to the ships; they not unwilling flew,
 Bearing from battle the afflicted King
 With foaming chests and bellies grey with dust.
 Soon Hector, noting his retreat, aloud
 Call'd on the Trojans and allies of Troy.
 Trojans and Lycians, and close-fighting sons
 Of Dardanus! oh summon all your might;
 Now, now be men! Their bravest is withdrawn!
 Glory and honor from Saturnian Jove
 On me attend; now full against the Greeks
 Drive all your steeds, and win a deathless name.
 He spake--and all drew courage from his word.
 As when his hounds bright-tooth'd some hunter cheers
 Against the lion or the forest-boar,
 So Priame�an Hector cheer'd his host
 Magnanimous against the sons of Greece,
 Terrible as gore-tainted Mars. Among
 The foremost warriors, with success elate
 He strode, and flung himself into the fight
 Black as a storm which sudden from on high
 Descending, furrows deep the gloomy flood.
 Then whom slew Priame�an Hector first,
 Whom last, by Jove, that day, with glory crown'd?
 Ass�us, Dolops, Orus, Agela�s,
 Autono�s, Hippono�s, �symnus,
 Opheltius and Opites first he slew,
 All leaders of the Greeks, and, after these,
 The people. As when whirlwinds of the West
 A storm encounter from the gloomy South,
 The waves roll multitudinous, and the foam
 Upswept by wandering gusts fills all the air,
 So Hector swept the Grecians. Then defeat
 Past remedy and havoc had ensued,
 Then had the routed Grecians, flying, sought
 Their ships again, but that Ulysses[12] thus
 Summon'd the brave Tydides to his aid.
 Whence comes it, Diomede, that we forget
 Our wonted courage? Hither, O my friend!
 And, fighting at my side, ward off the shame
 That must be ours, should Hector seize the fleet.
 To whom the valiant Diomede replied.
 I will be firm; trust me thou shalt not find
 Me shrinking; yet small fruit of our attempts
 Shall follow, for the Thunderer, not to us,
 But to the Trojan, gives the glorious day.
 The Hero spake, and from his chariot cast
 Thymbr�us to the ground pierced through the pap,
 While by Ulysses' hand his charioteer
 Godlike Molion, fell. The warfare thus
 Of both for ever closed, them there they left,
 And plunging deep into the warrior-throng
 Troubled the multitude. As when two boars
 Turn desperate on the close-pursuing hounds,
 So they, returning on the host of Troy,
 Slew on all sides, and overtoil'd with flight
 From Hector's arm, the Greeks meantime respired.
 Two warriors, next, their chariot and themselves
 They took, plebeians brave, sons of the seer
 Percosian Merops in prophetic skill
 Surpassing all; he both his sons forbad
 The mortal field, but disobedient they
 Still sought it, for their destiny prevail'd.
 Spear-practised Diomede of life deprived
 Both these, and stripp'd them of their glorious arms,
 While by Ulysses' hand Hippodamus
 Died and Hypeirochus. And now the son
 Of Saturn, looking down from Ida, poised
 The doubtful war, and mutual deaths they dealt.
 Tydides plunged his spear into the groin
 Of the illustrious son of P�on, bold
 Agastrophus. No steeds at his command
 Had he, infatuate! but his charioteer
 His steeds detain'd remote, while through the van
 Himself on foot rush'd madly till he fell.
 But Hector through the ranks darting his eye
 Perceived, and with ear-piercing cries advanced
 Against them, follow'd by the host of Troy.
 The son of Tydeus, shuddering, his approach
 Discern'd, and instant to Ulysses spake.[13]
 Now comes the storm! This way the mischief rolls!
 Stand and repulse the Trojan. Now be firm.
 He said, and hurling his long-shadow'd beam
 Smote Hector. At his helmet's crown he aim'd,
 Nor err'd, but brass encountering brass, the point
 Glanced wide, for he had cased his youthful brows
 In triple brass, Apollo's glorious gift.
 Yet with rapidity at such a shock
 Hector recoil'd into the multitude
 Afar, where sinking to his knees, he lean'd
 On his broad palm, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 But while Tydides follow'd through the van
 His stormy spear, which in the distant soil
 Implanted stood, Hector his scatter'd sense
 Recovering, to his chariot sprang again,
 And, diving deep into his host, escaped.
 The noble son of Tydeus, spear in hand,
 Rush'd after him, and as he went, exclaim'd.
 Dog! thou hast now escaped; but, sure the stroke
 Approach'd thee nigh, well-aim'd. Once more thy prayers
 Which ever to Apollo thou prefer'st
 Entering the clash of battle, have prevail'd,
 And he hath rescued thee. But well beware
 Our next encounter, for if also me
 Some God befriend, thou diest. Now will I seek
 Another mark, and smite whom next I may.
 He spake, and of his armor stripp'd the son
 Spear-famed of P�on. Meantime Paris, mate
 Of beauteous Helen, drew his bow against
 Tydides; by a pillar of the tomb
 Of Ilus, ancient senator revered,
 Conceal'd he stood, and while the Hero loosed
 His corselet from the breast of P�on's son
 Renown'd, and of his helmet and his targe
 Despoil'd him; Paris, arching quick his bow,
 No devious shaft dismiss'd, but his right foot
 Pierced through the sole, and fix'd it to the ground.
 Transported from his ambush forth he leap'd
 With a loud laugh, and, vaunting, thus exclaim'd:
 Oh shaft well shot! it galls thee. Would to heaven
 That it had pierced thy heart, and thou hadst died!
 So had the Trojans respite from their toils
 Enjoy'd, who, now, shudder at sight of thee
 Like she-goats when the lion is at hand.
 To whom, undaunted, Diomede replied.
 Archer shrew-tongued! spie-maiden! man of curls![14]
 Shouldst thou in arms attempt me face to face,
 Thy bow and arrows should avail thee nought.
 Vain boaster! thou hast scratch'd my foot--no more--
 And I regard it as I might the stroke
 Of a weak woman or a simple child.
 The weapons of a dastard and a slave
 Are ever such. More terrible are mine,
 And whom they pierce, though slightly pierced, he dies.
 His wife her cheeks rends inconsolable,
 His babes are fatherless, his blood the glebe
 Incarnadines, and where he bleeds and rots
 More birds of prey than women haunt the place.
 He ended, and Ulysses, drawing nigh,
 Shelter'd Tydides; he behind the Chief
 Of Ithaca sat drawing forth the shaft,
 But pierced with agonizing pangs the while.
 Then, climbing to his chariot-seat, he bade
 Sthenelus hasten to the hollow ships,
 Heart-sick with pain. And now alone was seen
 Spear-famed Ulysses; not an Argive more
 Remain'd, so universal was the rout,
 And groaning, to his own great heart he said.
 Alas! what now awaits me? If, appall'd
 By multitudes, I fly, much detriment;
 And if alone they intercept me here,
 Still more; for Jove hath scatter'd all the host,
 Yet why these doubts! for know I not of old
 That only dastards fly, and that the voice
 Of honor bids the famed in battle stand,
 Bleed they themselves, or cause their foes to bleed?
 While busied in such thought he stood, the ranks
 Of Trojans fronted with broad shields, enclosed
 The hero with a ring, hemming around
 Their own destruction. As when dogs, and swains
 In prime of manhood, from all quarters rush
 Around a boar, he from his thicket bolts,
 The bright tusk whetting in his crooked jaws:
 They press him on all sides, and from beneath
 Loud gnashings hear, yet firm, his threats defy;
 Like them the Trojans on all sides assail'd
 Ulysses dear to Jove. First with his spear
 He sprang impetuous on a valiant chief,
 Whose shoulder with a downright point he pierced,
 De�opites; Tho�n next he slew,
 And Ennomus, and from his coursers' backs
 Alighting quick, Chersidamas; beneath
 His bossy shield the gliding weapon pass'd
 Right through his navel; on the plain he fell
 Expiring, and with both hands clench'd the dust.
 Them slain he left, and Charops wounded next,
 Brother of Socus, generous Chief, and son
 Of Hippasus; brave Socus to the aid
 Of Charops flew, and, godlike, thus began.
 Illustrious chief, Ulysses! strong to toil
 And rich in artifice! Or boast to-day
 Two sons of Hippasus, brave warriors both,
 Of armor and of life bereft by thee,
 Or to my vengeful spear resign thy own!
 So saying, Ulysses' oval disk he smote.
 Through his bright disk the stormy weapon flew,
 Transpierced his twisted mail, and from his side
 Drove all the skin, but to his nobler parts
 Found entrance none, by Pallas turn'd aslant.[15]
 Ulysses, conscious of his life untouch'd,
 Retired a step from Socus, and replied.
 Ah hapless youth; thy fate is on the wing;
 Me thou hast forced indeed to cease a while
 From battle with the Trojans, but I speak
 Thy death at hand; for vanquish'd by my spear,
 This self-same day thou shalt to me resign
 Thy fame, thy soul to Pluto steed-renown'd.
 He ceased; then Socus turn'd his back to fly,
 But, as he turn'd, his shoulder-blades between
 He pierced him, and the spear urged through his breast.
 On his resounding arms he fell, and thus
 Godlike Ulysses gloried in his fall.
 Ah, Socus, son of Hippasus, a chief
 Of fame equestrian! swifter far than thou
 Death follow'd thee, and thou hast not escaped.
 Ill-fated youth! thy parents' hands thine eyes
 Shall never close, but birds of ravenous maw
 Shall tear thee, flapping thee with frequent wing,
 While me the noble Grecians shall entomb!
 So saying, the valiant Socus' spear he drew
 From his own flesh, and through his bossy shield.
 The weapon drawn, forth sprang the blood, and left
 His spirit faint. Then Ilium's dauntless sons,
 Seeing Ulysses' blood, exhorted glad
 Each other, and, with force united, all
 Press'd on him. He, retiring, summon'd loud
 His followers. Thrice, loud as mortal may,
 He call'd, and valiant Menelaus thrice
 Hearing the voice, to Ajax thus remark'd.
 Illustrious son of Telamon! The voice
 Of Laertiades comes o'er my ear
 With such a sound, as if the hardy chief,
 Abandon'd of his friends, were overpower'd
 By numbers intercepting his retreat.
 Haste! force we quick a passage through the ranks.
 His worth demands our succor, for I fear
 Lest sole conflicting with the host of Troy,
 Brave as he is, he perish, to the loss
 Unspeakable and long regret of Greece.
 So saying, he went, and Ajax, godlike Chief,
 Follow'd him. At the voice arrived, they found
 Ulysses Jove-beloved compass'd about
 By Trojans, as the lynxes in the hills,
 Adust for blood, compass an antler'd stag
 Pierced by an archer; while his blood is warm
 And his limbs pliable, from him he 'scapes;
 But when the feather'd barb hath quell'd his force,
 In some dark hollow of the mountain's side,
 The hungry troop devour him; chance, the while,
 Conducts a lion thither, before whom
 All vanish, and the lion feeds alone;
 So swarm'd the Trojan powers, numerous and bold,
 Around Ulysses, who with wary skill
 Heroic combated his evil day.
 But Ajax came, cover'd with his broad shield
 That seem'd a tower, and at Ulysses' side
 Stood fast; then fled the Trojans wide-dispersed,
 And Menelaus led him by the hand
 Till his own chariot to his aid approach'd.
 But Ajax, springing on the Trojans, slew
 Doryclus, from the loins of Priam sprung,
 But spurious. Pandocus he wounded next,
 Then wounded Pyrasus, and after him
 Pylartes and Lysander. As a flood
 Runs headlong from the mountains to the plain
 After long showers from Jove; many a dry oak
 And many a pine the torrent sweeps along,
 And, turbid, shoots much soil into the sea,
 So, glorious Ajax troubled wide the field,
 Horse and man slaughtering, whereof Hector yet
 Heard not; for on the left of all the war
 He fought beside Scamander, where around
 Huge Nestor, and Idomeneus the brave,
 Most deaths were dealt, and loudest roar'd the fight.
 There Hector toil'd, feats wonderful of spear
 And horsemanship achieving, and the lines
 Of many a phalanx desolating wide.
 Nor even then had the bold Greeks retired,
 But that an arrow triple-barb'd, dispatch'd
 By Paris, Helen's mate, against the Chief
 Machaon warring with distinguish'd force,
 Pierced his right shoulder. For his sake alarm'd,
 The valor-breathing Grecians fear'd, lest he
 In that disast'rous field should also fall.[16]
 At once, Idomeneus of Crete approach'd
 The noble Nestor, and him thus bespake.
 Arise, Neleian Nestor! Pride of Greece!
 Ascend thy chariot, and Machaon placed
 Beside thee, bear him, instant to the fleet.
 For one, so skill'd in medicine, and to free
 The inherent barb, is worth a multitude.
 He said, nor the Gerenian hero old
 Aught hesitated, but into his seat
 Ascended, and Machaon, son renown'd
 Of �sculapius, mounted at his side.
 He lash'd the steeds, they not unwilling sought
 The hollow ships, long their familiar home.
 Cebriones, meantime, the charioteer
 Of Hector, from his seat the Trojan ranks
 Observing sore discomfited, began.
 Here are we busied, Hector! on the skirts
 Of roaring battle, and meantime I see
 Our host confused, their horses and themselves
 All mingled. Telamonian Ajax there
 Routs them; I know the hero by his shield.
 Haste, drive we thither, for the carnage most
 Of horse and foot conflicting furious, there
 Rages, and infinite the shouts arise.
 He said, and with shrill-sounding scourge the steeds
 Smote ample-maned; they, at the sudden stroke
 Through both hosts whirl'd the chariot, shields and men
 Trampling; with blood the axle underneath
 All redden'd, and the chariot-rings with drops
 From the horse-hoofs, and from the fellied wheels.
 Full on the multitude he drove, on fire
 To burst the phalanx, and confusion sent
 Among the Greeks, for nought[17] he shunn'd the spear.
 All quarters else with falchion or with lance,
 Or with huge stones he ranged, but cautious shunn'd
 The encounter of the Telamonian Chief.
 But the eternal father throned on high
 With fear fill'd Ajax; panic-fixt he stood,
 His seven-fold shield behind his shoulder cast,
 And hemm'd by numbers, with an eye askant,
 Watchful retreated. As a beast of prey
 Retiring, turns and looks, so he his face
 Turn'd oft, retiring slow, and step by step.
 As when the watch-dogs and assembled swains
 Have driven a tawny lion from the stalls,
 Then, interdicting him his wish'd repast,
 Watch all the night, he, famish'd, yet again
 Comes furious on, but speeds not, kept aloof
 By frequent spears from daring hands, but more
 By flash of torches, which, though fierce, he dreads,
 Till, at the dawn, sullen he stalks away;
 So from before the Trojans Ajax stalk'd
 Sullen, and with reluctance slow retired.
 His brave heart trembling for the fleet of Greece.
 As when (the boys o'erpower'd) a sluggish ass,
 On whose tough sides they have spent many a staff,
 Enters the harvest, and the spiry ears
 Crops persevering; with their rods the boys
 Still ply him hard, but all their puny might
 Scarce drives him forth when he hath browsed his fill,
 So, there, the Trojans and their foreign aids
 With glittering lances keen huge Ajax urged,
 His broad shield's centre smiting.[18] He, by turns,
 With desperate force the Trojan phalanx dense
 Facing, repulsed them, and by turns he fled,
 But still forbad all inroad on the fleet.
 Trojans and Greeks between, alone, he stood
 A bulwark. Spears from daring hands dismiss'd
 Some, piercing his broad shield, there planted stood,
 While others, in the midway falling, spent
 Their disappointed rage deep in the ground.
 Eurypylus, Ev�mon's noble son,
 Him seeing, thus, with weapons overwhelmed
 Flew to his side, his glittering lance dismiss'd,
 And Apisaon, son of Phausias, struck
 Under the midriff; through his liver pass'd
 The ruthless point, and, falling, he expired.
 Forth sprang Eurypylus to seize the spoil;
 Whom soon as godlike Alexander saw
 Despoiling Apisaon of his arms,
 Drawing incontinent his bow, he sent
 A shaft to his right thigh; the brittle reed
 Snapp'd, and the rankling barb stuck fast within.
 Terrified at the stroke, the wounded Chief
 To his own band retired, but, as he went,
 With echoing voice call'd on the Dana�--
 Friends! Counsellors, and leaders of the Greeks!
 Turn ye and stand, and from his dreadful lot
 Save Ajax whelm'd with weapons; 'scape, I judge,
 He cannot from the roaring fight, yet oh
 Stand fast around him; if save ye may,
 Your champion huge, the Telamonian Chief!
 So spake the wounded warrior. They at once
 With sloping bucklers, and with spears erect,
 To his relief approach'd. Ajax with joy
 The friendly phalanx join'd, then turn'd and stood.
 Thus burn'd the embattled field as with the flames
 Of a devouring fire. Meantime afar
 From all that tumult the Neleian mares
 Bore Nestor, foaming as they ran, with whom
 Machaon also rode, leader revered.
 Achilles mark'd him passing; for he stood
 Exalted on his huge ship's lofty stern,
 Spectator of the toil severe, and flight
 Deplorable of the defeated Greeks.
 He call'd his friend Patroclus. He below
 Within his tent the sudden summons heard
 And sprang like Mars abroad, all unaware
 That in that sound he heard the voice of fate.
 Him first Menoetius' gallant son address'd.
 What would Achilles? Wherefore hath he call'd?
 To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift:
 Brave Menoetiades! my soul's delight!
 Soon will the Grecians now my knees surround
 Suppliant, by dread extremity constrain'd.
 But fly Patroclus, haste, oh dear to Jove!
 Inquire of Nestor, whom he hath convey'd
 From battle, wounded? Viewing him behind,
 I most believed him �sculapius' son
 Machaon, but the steeds so swiftly pass'd
 My galley, that his face escaped my note.[19]
 He said, and prompt to gratify his friend,
 Forth ran Patroclus through the camp of Greece.
 Now when Neleian Nestor to his tent
 Had brought Machaon, they alighted both,
 And the old hero's friend Eurymedon
 Released the coursers. On the beach awhile
 Their tunics sweat-imbued in the cool air
 They ventilated, facing full the breeze,
 Then on soft couches in the tent reposed.
 Meantime, their beverage Hecamede mix'd,
 The old King's bright-hair'd captive, whom he brought
 From Tenedos, what time Achilles sack'd
 The city, daughter of the noble Chief
 Arsino�s, and selected from the rest
 For Nestor, as the honorable meed
 Of counsels always eminently wise.
 She, first, before them placed a table bright,
 With feet coerulean; thirst-provoking sauce
 She brought them also in a brazen tray,
 Garlic[20] and honey new, and sacred meal.
 Beside them, next, she placed a noble cup
 Of labor exquisite, which from his home
 The ancient King had brought with golden studs
 Embellish'd; it presented to the grasp
 Four ears; two golden turtles, perch'd on each,
 Seem'd feeding, and two turtles[21] form'd the base.
 That cup once fill'd, all others must have toil'd
 To move it from the board, but it was light
 In Nestor's hand; he lifted it with ease.[22]
 The graceful virgin in that cup a draught
 Mix'd for them, Pramnian wine and savory cheese
 Of goat's milk, grated with a brazen rasp,
 Then sprinkled all with meal. The draught prepared,
 She gave it to their hand; they, drinking, slaked
 Their fiery thirst, and with each other sat
 Conversing friendly, when the godlike youth
 By brave Achilles sent, stood at the door.
 Him seeing, Nestor from his splendid couch
 Arose, and by the hand leading him in,
 Entreated him to sit, but that request
 Patroclus, on his part refusing, said,
 Oh venerable King! no seat is here
 For me, nor may thy courtesy prevail.
 He is irascible, and to be fear'd
 Who bade me ask what Chieftain thou hast brought
 From battle, wounded; but untold I learn;
 I see Machaon, and shall now report
 As I have seen; oh ancient King revered!
 Thou know'st Achilles fiery, and propense
 Blame to impute even where blame is none.
 To whom the brave Gerenian thus replied.
 Why feels Achilles for the wounded Greeks
 Such deep concern? He little knows the height
 To which our sorrows swell. Our noblest lie
 By spear or arrow wounded in the fleet.
 Diomede, warlike son of Tydeus, bleeds,
 Gall'd by a shaft; Ulysses, glorious Chief,
 And Agamemnon[23] suffer by the spear;
 Eurypylus is shot into the thigh,
 And here lies still another newly brought
 By me from fight, pierced also by a shaft.
 What then? How strong soe'er to give them aid,
 Achilles feels no pity of the Greeks.
 Waits he till every vessel on the shore
 Fired, in despite of the whole Argive host,
 Be sunk in its own ashes, and ourselves
 All perish, heaps on heaps? For in my limbs
 No longer lives the agility of my youth.
 Oh, for the vigor of those days again,
 When Elis, for her cattle which we took,
 Strove with us and Itymoneus I slew,
 Brave offspring of Hypirochus; he dwelt
 In Elis, and while I the pledges drove,
 Stood for his herd, but fell among the first
 By a spear hurl'd from my victorious arm.
 Then fled the rustic multitude, and we
 Drove off abundant booty from the plain,
 Herds fifty of fat beeves, large flocks of goats
 As many, with as many sheep and swine,
 And full thrice fifty mares of brightest hue,
 All breeders, many with their foals beneath.
 All these, by night returning safe, we drove
 Into Neleian Pylus, and the heart
 Rejoiced of Neleus, in a son so young
 A warrior, yet enrich'd with such a prize.
 At early dawn the heralds summon'd loud
 The citizens, to prove their just demands
 On fruitful Elis, and the assembled Chiefs
 Division made (for numerous were the debts
 Which the Epeans, in the weak estate
 Of the unpeopled Pylus, had incurr'd;
 For Hercules, few years before, had sack'd[24]
 Our city, and our mightiest slain. Ourselves
 The gallant sons of Neleus, were in all
 Twelve youths, of whom myself alone survived;
 The rest all perish'd; whence, presumptuous grown,
 The brazen-mail'd Epeans wrong'd us oft).
 A herd of beeves my father for himself
 Selected, and a numerous flock beside,
 Three hundred sheep, with shepherds for them all.
 For he a claimant was of large arrears
 From sacred Elis. Four unrivall'd steeds
 With his own chariot to the games he sent,
 That should contend for the appointed prize
 A tripod; but Augeias, King of men,
 Detain'd the steeds, and sent the charioteer
 Defrauded home. My father, therefore, fired
 At such foul outrage both of deeds and words,
 Took much, and to the Pylians gave the rest
 For satisfaction of the claims of all.
 While thus we busied were in these concerns,
 And in performance of religious rites
 Throughout the city, came the Epeans arm'd,
 Their whole vast multitude both horse and foot
 On the third day; came also clad in brass
 The two Molions, inexpert as yet
 In feats of arms, and of a boyish age.
 There is a city on a mountain's head,
 Fast by the banks of Alpheus, far remote,
 The utmost town which sandy Pylus owns,
 Named Thryo�ssa, and, with ardor fired
 To lay it waste, that city they besieged.
 Now when their host had traversed all the plain,
 Minerva from Olympus flew by night
 And bade us arm; nor were the Pylians slow
 To assemble, but impatient for the fight.
 Me, then, my father suffer'd not to arm,
 But hid my steeds, for he supposed me raw
 As yet, and ignorant how war is waged.
 Yet, even thus, unvantaged and on foot,
 Superior honors I that day acquired
 To theirs who rode, for Pallas led me on
 Herself to victory. There is a stream
 Which at Arena falls into the sea,
 Named Minu�ius; on that river's bank
 The Pylian horsemen waited day's approach,
 And thither all our foot came pouring down.
 The flood divine of Alpheus thence we reach'd
 At noon, all arm'd complete; there, hallow'd rites
 We held to Jove omnipotent, and slew
 A bull to sacred Alpheus, with a bull
 To Neptune, and a heifer of the herd
 To Pallas; then, all marshall'd as they were,
 From van to rear our legions took repast,
 And at the river's side slept on their arms.
 Already the Epean host had round
 Begirt the city, bent to lay it waste,
 A task which cost them, first, both blood and toil,
 For when the radiant sun on the green earth
 Had risen, with prayer to Pallas and to Jove,
 We gave them battle. When the Pylian host
 And the Epeans thus were close engaged,
 I first a warrior slew, Mulius the brave,
 And seized his coursers. He the eldest-born
 Of King Augeias' daughters had espoused
 The golden Agamede; not an herb
 The spacious earth yields but she knew its powers,
 Him, rushing on me, with my brazen lance
 I smote, and in the dust he fell; I leap'd
 Into his seat, and drove into the van.
 A panic seized the Epeans when they saw
 The leader of their horse o'erthrown, a Chief
 Surpassing all in fight. Black as a cloud
 With whirlwind fraught, I drove impetuous on,
 Took fifty chariots, and at side of each
 Lay two slain warriors, with their teeth the soil
 Grinding, all vanquish'd by my single arm.
 I had slain also the Molions, sons
 Of Actor, but the Sovereign of the deep
 Their own authentic Sire, in darkness dense
 Involving both, convey'd them safe away.
 Then Jove a victory of prime renown
 Gave to the Pylians; for we chased and slew
 And gather'd spoil o'er all the champain spread
 With scatter'd shields, till we our steeds had driven
 To the Buprasian fields laden with corn,
 To the Olenian rock, and to a town
 In fair Colona situate, and named
 Alesia. There it was that Pallas turn'd
 Our people homeward; there I left the last
 Of all the slain, and he was slain by me.
 Then drove the Achaians from Buprasium home
 Their coursers fleet, and Jove, of Gods above,
 Received most praise, Nestor of men below.
 Such once was I. But brave Achilles shuts
 His virtues close, an unimparted store;
 Yet even he shall weep, when all the host,
 His fellow-warriors once, shall be destroy'd.
 But recollect, young friend! the sage advice
 Which when thou earnest from Phthia to the aid
 Of Agamemnon, on that selfsame day
 Menoetius gave thee. We were present there,
 Ulysses and myself, both in the house,
 And heard it all; for to the house we came
 Of Peleus in our journey through the land
 Of fertile Greece, gathering her states to war.
 We found thy noble sire Menoetius there,
 Thee and Achilles; ancient Peleus stood
 To Jove the Thunderer offering in his court
 Thighs of an ox, and on the blazing rites
 Libation pouring from a cup of gold.
 While ye on preparation of the feast
 Attended both, Ulysses and myself
 Stood in the vestibule; Achilles flew
 Toward us, introduced us by the hand,
 And, seating us, such liberal portion gave
 To each, as hospitality requires.
 Our thirst, at length, and hunger both sufficed,
 I, foremost speaking, ask'd you to the wars,
 And ye were eager both, but from your sires
 Much admonition, ere ye went, received.
 Old Peleus charged Achilles to aspire
 To highest praise, and always to excel.
 But thee, thy sire Menoetius thus advised.
 "My son! Achilles boasts the nobler birth,
 But thou art elder; he in strength excels
 Thee far; thou, therefore, with discretion rule
 His inexperience; thy advice impart
 With gentleness; instruction wise suggest
 Wisely, and thou shalt find him apt to learn."
 So thee thy father taught, but, as it seems,
 In vain. Yet even now essay to move
 Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please,
 Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail
 To rouse his valiant heart? men rarely scorn
 The earnest intercession of a friend.
 But if some prophecy alarm his fears,
 And from his Goddess mother he have aught
 Received, who may have learnt the same from Jove,
 Thee let him send at least, and order forth
 With thee the Myrmidons; a dawn of hope
 Shall thence, it may be, on our host arise.
 And let him send thee to the battle clad
 In his own radiant armor; Troy, deceived
 By such resemblance, shall abstain perchance
 From conflict, and the weary Greeks enjoy
 Short respite; it is all that war allows.
 Fresh as ye are, ye, by your shouts alone,
 May easily repulse an army spent
 With labor from the camp and from the fleet.
 Thus Nestor, and his mind bent to his words.
 Back to �acides through all the camp
 He ran; and when, still running, he arrived
 Among Ulysses' barks, where they had fix'd
 The forum, where they minister'd the laws,
 And had erected altars to the Gods,
 There him Eurypylus, Ev�mon's son,
 Illustrious met, deep-wounded in his thigh,
 And halting-back from battle. From his head
 The sweat, and from his shoulders ran profuse,
 And from his perilous wound the sable blood
 Continual stream'd; yet was his mind composed.
 Him seeing, Menoetiades the brave
 Compassion felt, and mournful, thus began.
 Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece!
 Left ye your native country that the dogs
 Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy?
 But tell me, Hero! say, Eurypylus!
 Have the Achaians power still to withstand
 The enormous force of Hector, or is this
 The moment when his spear must pierce us all?
 To whom Eurypylus, discreet, replied.
 Patroclus, dear to Jove! there is no help,
 No remedy. We perish at our ships.
 The warriors, once most strenuous of the Greeks,
 Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might
 Increases ever. But thyself afford
 To me some succor; lead me to my ship;
 Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore
 With warm ablution cleanse, and on the wound
 Smooth unguents spread, the same as by report
 Achilles taught thee; taught, himself, their use
 By Chiron, Centaur, justest of his kind
 For Podalirius and Machaon both
 Are occupied. Machaon, as I judge,
 Lies wounded in his tent, needing like aid
 Himself, and Podalirius in the field
 Maintains sharp conflict with the sons of Troy.
 To whom Menoetius' gallant son replied.
 Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act
 In this perplexity? what course pursue?
 I seek the brave Achilles, to whose ear
 I bear a message from the ancient chief
 Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks.
 Yet will I not, even for such a cause,
 My friend! abandon thee in thy distress.
 He ended, and his arms folding around
 The warrior bore him thence into his tent.
 His servant, on his entrance, spread the floor
 With hides, on which Patroclus at his length
 Extended him, and with his knife cut forth
 The rankling point; with tepid lotion, next,
 He cleansed the gore, and with a bitter root
 Bruised small between his palms, sprinkled the wound.
 At once, the anodyne his pain assuaged,
 The wound was dried within, and the blood ceased.

	It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks. All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes, and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter. On the contrary, the Trojans see their general at their head, and Jupiter himself fights on their side. Upon this hinge turns the whole poem. The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus, and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles.

	The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents. He gives Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the war without his assistance, and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the poem.
