title: Rhymes for Gloriana - II.  On Suddenly Receiving a Curl Long Refused
---

 Oh, saucy gold circle of fairyland silk - 
 Impudent, intimate, delicate treasure:
 A noose for my heart and a ring for my finger: - 
 Here in my study you sing me a measure.

 Whimsy and song in my little gray study!
 Words out of wonderland, praising her fineness,
 Touched with her pulsating, delicate laughter,
 Saying, "The girl is all daring and kindness!"

 Saying, "Her soul is all feminine gameness,
 Trusting her insights, ardent for living;
 She would be weeping with me and be laughing,
 A thoroughbred, joyous receiving and giving!"
