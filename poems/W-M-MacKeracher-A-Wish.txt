When my time comes to quit this pleasing scene,
 And drop from out the busy life of men;
When I shall cease to be where I have been
 So willingly, and ne'er may be again;
When my abandoned tabernacle's dust
 With dust is laid, and I am counted dead;
Ere I am quite forgotten, as I must
 Be in a little while, let this be said:

He loved this good God's world, the night and day,
 Men, women, children (these he loved the best);
Pictures and books he loved, and work and play,
 Music and silence, soberness and jest;
His mind was open, and his heart was gay;
 Green be his grave, and peaceful be his rest!
