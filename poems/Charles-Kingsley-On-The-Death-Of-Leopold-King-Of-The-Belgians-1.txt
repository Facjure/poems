title: On The Death Of Leopold, King Of The Belgians[1]
---

A King is dead!Another master mind
 Is summoned from the world-wide council hall.
Ah, for some seer, to say what links behind - 
 To read the mystic writing on the wall!

Be still, fond man:nor ask thy fate to know.
 Face bravely what each God-sent moment brings.
Above thee rules in love, through weal and woe,
 Guiding thy kings and thee, the King of kings.

Windsor Castle,
 November 10, 1865.
