The lady stood at the station bar,
 (Three currants in a bun)
And oh she was proud, as ladies are.
 (And the bun was baked a week ago.)

For a weekly wage she was standing there,
 (Three currants in a bun)
With a prominent bust and light gold hair.
 (And the bun was baked a week ago.)

The express came in at half-past two,
 (Three currants in a bun)
And there lighted a man in the navy blue.
 (And the bun was baked a week ago.)

 A stout sea-captain he was, I ween.
 (Three currants in a bun)
Much travel had made him very keen.
 (And the bun was baked a week ago.)

A sober man and steady was he.
 (Three currants in a bun)
He called not for brandy, but called for tea.
 (And the bun was baked a week ago.)

'Now something to eat, for the train is late.'
 (Three currants in a bun)
She brought him a bun on a greasy plate.
 (And the bun was baked a week ago.)

He left the bun, and he left the tea,
 (Three currants in a bun)
She charged him a shilling and let him be,
And the train went on at a quarter to three.
 (And the bun is old and weary.)
