INSCRIBED IN "TALES OF THE OCEAN"

 This first book that I ever knew
 Was read aloud to me by you -
 Friend of my boyhood, therefore take
 It back from me, for old times' sake -
 The selfsame "Tales" first read to me,
 Under "the old sweet apple tree,"
 Ere I myself could read such great
 Big words, - but listening all elate,
 At your interpreting, until
 Brain, heart and soul were all athrill
 With wonder, awe, and sheer excess
 Of wildest childish happiness.

 So take the book again - forget
 All else, - long years, lost hopes, regret;
 Sighs for the joys we ne'er attain,
 Prayers we have lifted all in vain;
 Tears for the faces seen no more,
 Once as the roses at the door!
 Take the enchanted book - And lo,
 On grassy swards of long ago,
 Sprawl out again, beneath the shade
 The breezy old-home orchard made,
 The veriest barefoot boy indeed -
 And I will listen as you read.
