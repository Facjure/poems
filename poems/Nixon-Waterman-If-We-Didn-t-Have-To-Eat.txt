title: If We Didn't Have To Eat
---

Life would be an easy matter
If we didn't have to eat.
If we never had to utter,
"Won't you pass the bread and butter,
Likewise push along that platter
Full of meat?"
Yes, if food were obsolete
Life would be a jolly treat,
If we didn't - shine or shower,
Old or young, 'bout every hour - 
Have to eat, eat, eat, eat, eat - 
'Twould be jolly if we didn't have to eat.

We could save a lot of money
If we didn't have to eat.
Could we cease our busy buying,
Baking, broiling, brewing, frying,
Life would then be oh, so sunny
And complete;
And we wouldn't fear to greet
Every grocer in the street
If we didn't - man and woman,
Every hungry, helpless human - 
Have to eat, eat, eat, eat, eat - 
We'd save money if we didn't have to eat.

All our worry would be over
If we didn't have to eat.
Would the butcher, baker, grocer
Get our hard-earned dollars? No, Sir!
We would then be right in clover
Cool and sweet.
Want and hunger we could cheat,
And we'd get there with both feet,
If we didn't - poor or wealthy,
Halt or nimble, sick or healthy - 
Have to eat, eat, eat, eat, eat,
We could get there if we didn't have to eat.

 Nixon Waterman.
