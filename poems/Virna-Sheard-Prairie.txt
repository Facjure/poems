Where yesterday rolled long waves of gold
 Beneath the burnished blue of the sky,
A silver-white sea lies still and cold,
 And a bitter wind blows by.

But nothing passes the door all day,
 Though my watching eyes grow worn and dim,
Save a lean, grey wolf that swings away
 To the far horizon rim.

Then, one by one, the stars glisten out
 Like frozen tears on a purple pall - 
The darkness folds my cabin about
 And the snow begins to fall.

I will make a hearth-fire red and bright
 And set a light by the window pane
For one who follows the trail to-night
 That will bring him home again.

Love will ride with him my heart to bless - 
 Joy will out-step him across the floor - 
What matters the great white loneliness
 When we bar the cabin door?
