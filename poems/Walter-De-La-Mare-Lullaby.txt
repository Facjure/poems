 Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
 The singing mouse sings plaintively,
 The sweet night-bird in the chesnut-tree - 
 They sing together, bird and mouse,
 In starlight, in darkness, lonely, sweet,
 The wild notes and the faint notes meet - 
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

 Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
 Amid the lilies floats the moth,
 The mole along his galleries goeth
 In the dark earth; the summer moon
 Looks like a shepherd through the pane
 Seeking his feeble lamb again - 
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!

 Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
 Time comes to keep night-watch with thee
 Nodding with roses; and the sea
 Saith 'Peace! Peace!' amid his foam
 White as thy night-clothes; 'O be still!'
 The wind cries up the whisp'ring hill - 
Sleep, sleep, lovely white soul!
