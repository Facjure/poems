 There's a thing we love to think of when the summer days are long,
 And the summer winds are blowing, and the summer sun is strong,
 When the orchards and the meadows throw their fragrance on the air,
 When the grain-fields flaunt their riches, and the glow is everywhere.
 Something sings it all the day,
Canada, fair Canada,
And the pride thrills through and through us,
'Tis our birthplace, Canada!

 There's a thing we love to think of when the frost and ice and snow
 Hold high carnival together, and the biting north winds blow.
 There's a thing we love to think of through the bitter winter hours,
 For it stirs a warmth within us - 'tis this fair young land of ours.
 Something sings it all the day,
Canada, fair Canada,
 And the pride thrills through and through us,
'Tis our birthplace, Canada!

 Ours with all her youth and promise, ours with all her strength
and might,
 Ours with all her mighty waters and her forests deep as night.
 Other lands may far outshine her, boast more charms than she can claim,
 But this young land is our own land, and we love her very name.
 Something sings it all the day,
Canada, fair Canada,
And the pride thrills through and through us,
'Tis our birthplace, Canada!

 Let the man born in old England love the dear old land the most,
 For what spot a man is born in, of that spot he's fain to boast;
 Let the Scot look back toward Scotland with a longing in his eyes,
 And the exile from old Erin think her green shores paradise,
 Native born are we, are we,
Canada, fair Canada,
 And the pride thrills through and through us,
'Tis our birthplace, Canada!

 Well we love that sea-girt island, and we strive to understand
 All the greatness, all the grandeur, of the glorious Mother Land;
 And we cheer her to the skies, cheer her till the echoes start,
 For the old land holds our homage, but the new land holds our heart!
 Native born are we, are we,
Canada, fair Canada!
And the pride thrills through and through us,
'Tis our birthplace, Canada!
