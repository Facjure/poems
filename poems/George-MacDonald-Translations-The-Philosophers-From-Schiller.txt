title: Translations. - The Philosophers. (From Schiller.)
---

The principle whence everything
 To life and shape ascended--
The pulley whereon Zeus the ring
Of Earth, which else in sherds would spring,
 Has carefully suspended--
To genius I yield him a claim
Who fathoms for me what its name,
 Save I withdraw its curtain:
 It is--ten is not thirteen.

That snow makes cold, that fire burns,
 That man on two feet goeth,
That in the heavens the sun sojourns--
This much the man who logic spurns
 Through his own senses knoweth;
But metaphysics who has got,
Knows he that burneth, freezeth not;
 Knows 'tis the moist that wetteth,
 And 'tis the rough that fretteth.

Great Homer sings his epic high;
 The hero fronts his dangers;
The brave his duty still doth ply--
And did it while, I won't deny,
 Philosophers were strangers:
But grant by heart and brain achiev'd
What Locke and Des Cartes ne'er conceiv'd--
 By them yet, as behov�d,
 It possible was prov�d.

Strength for the Right is counted still;
 Bold laughs the strong hyena;
Who rule not, servants' parts must fill;
It goes quite tolerably ill
 Upon this world's arena;
But how it would be, if the plan
Of the universe now first began,
 In many a moral system
 All men may read who list 'em.

"Man needs with man must linked be
 To reach the goal of growing;
In the whole only worketh he;
Many drops go to make the sea;
 Much water sets mills going.
Then with the wild wolves do not stand,
But knit the state's enduring band:"
 From doctor's chair thus, tranquil,
 Herr Pufendorf and swan-quill.

But since to all, what doctors say
 Flies not as soon as spoken,
Nature will use her mother-way,
See that her chain fly not in tway,
 The circle be not broken:
Meantime, until the world's great round
Philosophy in one hath bound,
 She keeps it on the move, sir,
 By hunger and by love, sir.
