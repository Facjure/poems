title: I Know Not
---

Death!I know not what room you are abiding in,
 But I will go my way,
 Rejoicing day by day,
 Nor will I flee or stay
For fear I tread the path you may be hiding in.

Death!I know not, if my small barque be nearing you;
 But if you are at sea,
 Still there my sails float free;
 'What is to be will be.'
Nor will I mar the happy voyage by fearing you.

Death!I know not, what hour or spot you wait for me;
 My days untroubled flow,
 Just trusting on, I go,
 For oh, I know, I know,
Death is but Life that holds some glad new fate for me.
