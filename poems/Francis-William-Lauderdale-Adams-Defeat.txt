title: Defeat?
---

 Who is it speaks of defeat? - 
I tell you a Cause like ours
 Is greater than defeat can know;
It is the power of powers!

 As surely as the earth rolls round,
As surely as the glorious sun
 Brings the great world sea-wave,
Must our Cause be won!

 What is defeat to us? - 
Learn what a skirmish tells,
 While the great Army marches on
To storm earth's hells!
