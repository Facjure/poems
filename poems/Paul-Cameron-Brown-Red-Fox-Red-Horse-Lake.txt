title: Red Fox (Red Horse Lake)
---

A magnificent Red Devil
splayed out in his tracks;
this tumultuous soul, baron of the backwoods
with his provenance unknown ...
this compromise to individuality
abandons him to chorome death
under a canopy-canapï¿½ dream-coated rock dome.

Trepanned, empire of trees, dark matter
&amp; a castle of leaves,
a fish-hawk for a tomahawk
in his thermo-cline eyes ...
dithyrambic young osprey in the offing,
candelabra under stars.

Going inland for freshwater prawns,
sandalwood and tortoiseshells
finding bewitchment amid moving cars.
