title: At Bologna, In Remembrance Of The Late Insurrections, 1837 - II - Continued - Hard Task! Exclaim The Undisciplined, To Lean
---

 Hard task! exclaim the undisciplined, to lean
 On Patience coupled with such slow endeavour,
 That long-lived servitude must last for ever.
 Perish the groveling few, who, prest between
 Wrongs and the terror of redress, would wean
 Millions from glorious aims. Our chains to sever
 Let us break forth in tempest now or never! 
 What, is there then no space for golden mean
 And gradual progress? Twilight leads to day,
 And, even within the burning zones of earth,
 The hastiest sunrise yields a temperate ray;
 The softest breeze to fairest flowers gives birth:
 Think not that Prudence dwells in dark abodes,
 She scans the future with the eye of gods.
