title: Inscription For The Tomb Of Mr. Hamilton.
---

Pause here and think: a monitory rhyme
Demands one moment of thy fleeting time.
Consult life�s silent clock, thy bounding vein;
Seems it to say��Health here has long to reign?�
Hast thou the vigour of thy youth? an eye
That beams delight? a heart untaught to sigh?
Yet fear. Youth, ofttimes healthful and at ease,
Anticipates a day it never sees;
And many a tomb, like Hamilton�s, aloud
Exclaims �Prepare thee for an early shroud.�
