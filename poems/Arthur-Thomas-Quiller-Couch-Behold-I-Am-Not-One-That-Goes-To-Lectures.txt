By W. W.

 Behold! I am not one that goes to Lectures or the pow-wow of Professors.

 The elementary laws never apologise: neither do I apologise.

 I find letters from the Dean dropt on my table--and every one is signed by the Dean's name--

 And I leave them where they are; for I know that as long as I stay up

 Others will punctually come for ever and ever.

 I am one who goes to the river,

 I sit in the boat and think of 'life' and of 'time.'

 How life is much, but time is more; and the beginning is everything,

 But the end is something.

 I loll in the Parks, I go to the wicket, I swipe.

 I see twenty-two young men from Foster's watching me, and the trousers of the twenty-two young men,

 I see the Balliol men en masse watching me.--The Hottentot that loves his mother, the untutored Bedowee, the Cave-man that wears only his certificate of baptism, and the shaggy Sioux that hangs his testamur with his scalps.

 I see the Don who ploughed me in Rudiments watching me: and the wife of the Don who ploughed me in Rudiments watching me.

 I see the rapport of the wicket-keeper and umpire.I cannot see that I am out.

 Oh! you Umpires!

 I am not one who greatly cares for experience, soap, bull-dogs, cautions, majorities, or a graduated Income-Tax,

 The certainty of space, punctuation, sexes, institutions, copiousness, degrees, committees, delicatesse, or the fetters of rhyme--

 For none of these do I care: but least for the fetters of rhyme.

 Myself only I sing.Me Imperturbe!Me Prononce!

 Me progressive and the depth of me progressive,

 And the bathos, Anglice bathos

 Of me chanting to the Public the song of Simple Enumeration.
