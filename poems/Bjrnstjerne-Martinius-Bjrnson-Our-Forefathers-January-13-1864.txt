(See Note 23)

High memories with power
 Shine through the wintry North
On every peak's white tower,
 On Kattegat so swarth.
All is so still and spacious, `
 The Northern Lights flow free,
Creating bright and gracious
 A day of memory.

Each deed the North defending,
 Each thought for greater might,
A star-like word is sending
 Down through the frosty night!
To hope they call and boldness,
 And call with double cheer
To him, defying coldness,
 On guard the Eider near.

No anxious shadows clouding,
 No languid, lukewarm mist
Our heaven of mem'ries shrouding,
 This eve of battle-tryst!
May, as of yore, while ringing
 The bells unseen loud swelled,
Come leaders vict'ry bringing,
 Whom th' army ne'er beheld.
