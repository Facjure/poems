 That boy I took in the car last night,
 With the body that awfully sagged away,
 And the lips blood-crisped, and the eyes flame-bright,
 And the poor hands folded and cold as clay - 
 Oh, I've thought and I've thought of him all the day.

 For the weary old doctor says to me:
 "He'll only last for an hour or so.
 Both of his legs below the knee
 Blown off by a bomb. . . . So, lad, go slow,
 And please remember, he doesn't know."

 So I tried to drive with never a jar;
 And there was I cursing the road like mad,
 When I hears a ghost of a voice from the car:
 "Tell me, old chap, have I 'copped it' bad?"
 So I answers "No," and he says, "I'm glad."

 "Glad," says he, "for at twenty-two
 Life's so splendid, I hate to go.
 There's so much good that a chap might do,
 And I've fought from the start and I've suffered so.
 'Twould be hard to get knocked out now, you know."

 "Forget it," says I; then I drove awhile,
 And I passed him a cheery word or two;
 But he didn't answer for many a mile,
 So just as the hospital hove in view,
 Says I: "Is there nothing that I can do?"

 Then he opens his eyes and he smiles at me;
 And he takes my hand in his trembling hold;
 "Thank you - you're far too kind," says he:
 "I'm awfully comfy - stay . . . let's see:
 I fancy my blanket's come unrolled - 
 My feet, please wrap 'em - they're cold . . . they're cold."
