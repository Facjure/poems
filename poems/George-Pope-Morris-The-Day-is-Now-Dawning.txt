William.


The day is now dawning, love,
 Fled is the night--
I go like the morning, love,
 Cheerful and bright.
Then adieu, dearest Ellen:
 When evening is near,
I'll visit thy dwelling,
 For true love is here.


Ellen.


Oh, come where the fountain, love,
 Tranquilly flows;
Beneath the green mountain, love,
 Seek for repose;
There the days of our childhood,
 In love's golden beam,
'Mong the blue-bells and wildwood,
 Passed on like a dream.


William.


Oh, linger awhile, love!


Ellen.


I must away.


William.


Oh, grant me thy smile, love,
 'Tis Hope's cheering ray--
With evening expect me.


Ellen.


To the moment be true,
 And may angels protect thee--


Both.


Sweet Ellen, adieu!
Dear William, adieu!
