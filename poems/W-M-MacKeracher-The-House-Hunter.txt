As one who finds his house no longer fit,
 Too narrow for his needs, in nothing right,
Wanting in every homelike requisite,
 Devoid of beauty, barren of delight,
Goes forth from door to door and street to street,
 With eager-eyed expectancy to find
A new abode for his convenience meet,
 Spacious, commodious, fair, and to his mind;

So living souls recurrently outgrow
 Their mental tenements; their tastes appear
Too sordid, and their aims too cramped and low.
 And they keep moving onward year by year,
Each dwelling in its turn prepared to leave
For one more like the mansion they conceive.
