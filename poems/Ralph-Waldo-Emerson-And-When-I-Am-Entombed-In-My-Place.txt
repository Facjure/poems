title: And When I Am Entombed In My Place,
---

And when I am entombed in my place,
Be it remembered of a single man,
He never, though he dearly loved his race,
For fear of human eyes swerved from his plan.



Oh what is Heaven but the fellowship
Of minds that each can stand against the world
By its own meek and incorruptible will?



The days pass over me
And I am still the same;
The aroma of my life is gone
With the flower with which it came.

1833.
