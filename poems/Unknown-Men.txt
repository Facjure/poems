Men are four:
 He who knows and knows not that he knows, -
He is asleep - wake him;
 He who knows not and knows not that he knows not, -
He is a fool - shun him;
 He who knows not and knows that he knows not, -
He is a child - teach him;
 He who knows and knows that He knows, -
He is a king - follow him.
