title: The Morning Dream.

�Twas in the glad season of spring,
Asleep at the dawn of the day,
I dream�d what I cannot but sing,
So pleasant it seem�d as I lay.
I dream�d that, on ocean afloat,
Far hence to the westward I sail�d,
While the billows high lifted the boat,
And the fresh-blowing breeze never fail�d.


In the steerage a woman I saw,
Such at least was the form that she wore,
Whose beauty impress�d me with awe,
Ne�er taught me by woman before.
She sat, and a shield at her side
Shed light, like a sun on the waves,
And smiling divinely, she cried�
�I go to make freemen of slaves.�


Then, raising her voice to a strain
The sweetest that ear ever heard,
She sung of the slave�s broken chain,
Wherever her glory appear�d.
Some clouds, which had over us hung,
Fled, chased by her melody clear,
And methought while she liberty sung,
�Twas liberty only to hear.


Thus swiftly dividing the flood,
To a slave-cultured island we came,
Where a demon, her enemy, stood�
Oppression his terrible name.
In his hand, as the sign of his sway,
A scourge hung with lashes he bore,
And stood looking out for his prey
From Africa�s sorrowful shore.


But soon as, approaching the land,
That goddess-like woman he view�d,
The scourge he let fall from his hand,
With blood of his subjects imbrued.
I saw him both sicken and die,
And, the moment the monster expired,
Heard shouts, that ascended the sky,
From thousands with rapture inspired.


Awaking, how could I but muse
At what such a dream should betide?
But soon my ear caught the glad news,
Which served my weak thought for a guide;
That Britannia, renown�d o�er the waves
For the hatred she ever has shown
To the black-sceptred rulers of slaves,
Resolves to have none of her own.
