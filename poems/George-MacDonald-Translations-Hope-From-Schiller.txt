title: Translations. - Hope. (From Schiller.)
---

Men talk with their lips and dream with their soul
 Of better days hitherward pacing;
To a happy, a glorious, golden goal
 See them go running and chasing!
The world grows old and to youth returns,
But still for the Better man's bosom burns.

It is Hope leads him into life and its light;
 She haunts the little one merry;
The youth is inspired by her magic might;
 Her the graybeard cannot bury:
When he finds at the grave his ended scope,
On the grave itself he planteth Hope.

She was never begotten in Folly's brain,
 An empty illusion, to flatter;
In the Heart she cries, aloud and plain:
 We are born to something better!
And that which the inner voice doth say
The hoping spirit will not betray.
