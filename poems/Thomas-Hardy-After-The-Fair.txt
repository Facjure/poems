title: After The Fair
---

The singers are gone from the Cornmarket-place
 With their broadsheets of rhymes,
The street rings no longer in treble and bass
 With their skits on the times,
And the Cross, lately thronged, is a dim naked space
 That but echoes the stammering chimes.

From Clock-corner steps, as each quarter ding-dongs,
 Away the folk roam
By the "Hart" and Grey's Bridge into byways and "drongs,"
 Or across the ridged loam;
The younger ones shrilling the lately heard songs,
 The old saying, "Would we were home."

The shy-seeming maiden so mute in the fair
 Now rattles and talks,
And that one who looked the most swaggering there
 Grows sad as she walks,
And she who seemed eaten by cankering care
 In statuesque sturdiness stalks.

And midnight clears High Street of all but the ghosts
 Of its buried burghees,
From the latest far back to those old Roman hosts
 Whose remains one yet sees,
Who loved, laughed, and fought, hailed their friends, drank their toasts
 At their meeting-times here, just as these!

1902.
