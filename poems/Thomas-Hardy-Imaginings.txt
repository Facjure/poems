 She saw herself a lady
 With fifty frocks in wear,
And rolling wheels, and rooms the best,
 And faithful maidens' care,
 And open lawns and shady
 For weathers warm or drear.

 She found herself a striver,
 All liberal gifts debarred,
With days of gloom, and movements stressed,
 And early visions marred,
 And got no man to wive her
 But one whose lot was hard.

 Yet in the moony night-time
 She steals to stile and lea
During his heavy slumberous rest
 When homecome wearily,
 And dreams of some blest bright-time
 She knows can never be.
