Orange lichens, in sun-like clusters,
entomb the Rockface wall
a sheer ascent from the waterline
into glassy viscous green - -
the plummet from skyward
to lake face
passes breathless squadrons
of Dragon Flies
 - devil's Darning Needles
threading the air
where Wolf Spiders
bivouac in web-castles,
thin Draculas to their insect host
each hairy mantle black
with burrow moats at high watermark;
yet unforeseen are the funnel lairs
for bull snakes
each water thrasher
gracing the rotund, behemoth Rock
lunging like a Spirit Presence up
from this watery chalice.
