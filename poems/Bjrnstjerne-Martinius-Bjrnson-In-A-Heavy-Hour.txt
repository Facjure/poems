(See Note 13)

Be glad when danger presses
Each power your soul possesses!
 In greater strain
 Your strength shall gain,
Till greater vict'ry blesses!
Supports may break in pieces,
Your friends may have caprices,
 But you shall see,
 The end will be,
Your need of crutches ceases.
- 'T is clear,
 Whom God makes lonely,
To him He comes more near.
