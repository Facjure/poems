title: Ode On The Poetical Character
---

As once, if not with light regard, 
I read aright that gifted bard,
(Him whose school above the rest
His loveliest Elfin Queen has blest,)
One, only one, unrival�d fair,
Might hope the magic girdle wear,
At solemn tourney hung on high,
The wish of each love-darting eye;
Lo! to each other nymph in turn applied,
As if, in air unseen, some hov�ring hand,
Some chaste and angel-friend to virgin-fame,
With whisper�d spell had burst the starting band,
It left unblest her loath�d dishonour�d side;
Happier, hopeless fair, if never
Her baffled hand with vain endeavour
Had touch�d that fatal zone to her denied!
Young Fancy thus, to me divinest name,
To whom, prepar�d and bath�d in Heav�n,
The cest of amplest pow�r is giv�n:
To few the god-like gift assigns,
To gird their blest prophetic loins,
And gaze her visions wild, and feel unmix�d her flame!

The band, as fairy legends say,
Was wove on that creating day,
When He, who call�d with thought to birth
Yon tented sky, this laughing earth,
And dress�d with springs, and forests tall,
And pour�d the main engirting all,
Long by the lov�d enthusiast woo�d,
Himself in some diviner mood,
Retiring, sate with her alone,
And plac�d her on his sapphire throne,
The whiles, the vaulted shrine around,
Seraphic wires were heard to sound,
Now sublimest triumph swelling,
Now on love and mercy dwelling;
And she, from out the veiling cloud,
Breath�d her magic notes aloud:
And thou, thou rich-hair�d youth of morn,
And all thy subject life was born!
The dang�rous Passions kept aloof,
Far from the sainted growing woof:
But near it sate ecstatic Wonder
List�ning the deep applauding thunder:
And Truth, in sunny vest array�d,
By whose the tarsel�s eyes were made
All the shad�wy tribes of mind,
In braided dance their murmurs join�d,
And all the bright uncounted Pow�rs
Who feed on Heav�n�s ambrosial flow�rs.
Where is the bard, whose soul can now
Its high presuming hopes avow?
Where he who thinks, with rapture blind,
This hallow�d work for him design�d?

High on some cliff, to Heav�n up-pil�d,
Of rude access, of prospect wild,
Where, tangled round the jealous steep,
Strange shades o�erbrow the valleys deep,
And holy genii guard the rock,
Its glooms embrown, its springs unlock,
While on its rich ambitious head,
An Eden, like his own, lies spread.
I view that oak, the fancied glades among,
By which as Milton lay, his ev�ning ear,
From many a cloud that dropp�d ethereal dew,
Nigh spher�d in Heav�n its native strains could hear:
On which that ancient trump he reach�d was hung;
Thither oft his glory greeting,
From Waller�s myrtle shades retreating,
With many a vow from Hope�s aspiring tongue,
My trembling feet his guiding steps pursue;
In vain, such bliss to one alone,
Of all the sons of soul was known,
And Heav�n, and Fancy, kindred pow�rs,
Have now o�erturn�d th� inspiring bow�rs,
Or curtain�d close such scene from ev�ry future view.
