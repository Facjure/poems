title: An Autumn Walk.

Adown the track that skirts the shallow stream
 I wandered with blank mind; a bypath drew
 My aimless steps aside, and, ere I knew,
The forest closed around me like a dream.
The gold-strewn sward, the horizontal gleam
 Of the low sun, pouring its splendors through
 The far-withdrawing vistas, filled the view,
And everlasting beauty was supreme.

I knew not past or future; 'twas a mood
 Transcending time and taking in the whole.
I was both young and old; my lost childhood,
 Years yet unlived, were gathered round one goal;
And death was there familiar. Long I stood,
 And in eternity renewed my soul.
