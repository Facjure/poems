title: On The Author Of Letters On Literature.[1]

The Genius of the Augustan age
His head among Rome�s ruins rear�d,
And, bursting with heroic rage,
When literary Heron appear�d;


Thou hast, he cried, like him of old
Who set the Ephesian dome on fire,
By being scandalously bold,
Attain�d the mark of thy desire.


And for traducing Virgil�s name
Shalt share his merited reward;
A perpetuity of fame,
That rots, and stinks, and is abhorr�d.
