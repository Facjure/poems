title: Two Sat Down
---

Two sat down in the morning time,
 One to sing and one to spin.
All men listened the song sublime - 
 But no one listened the dull wheel's din.

The singer sat in a pleasant nook,
 And sang of a life that was fair and sweet,
While the spinner sat with a steadfast look,
 Busily plying her hands and feet.

The singer sang on with a rose in her hair,
 And all men listened her dulcet tone;
And the spinner spun on with a dull despair
 Down in her heart as she sat alone.

But lo! on the morrow no one said
 Aught of the singer or what she sang.
Men were saying:"Behold this thread,"
 And loud the praise of the spinner rang.

The world has forgotten the singer's name - 
 Her rose is faded, her songs are old;
But far o'er the ocean the spinner's fame
 Yet is blazoned in lines of gold.
