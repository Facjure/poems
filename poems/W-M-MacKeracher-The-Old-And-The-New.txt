Scorn not the Old; 'twas sacred in its day,
 A truth overpowering error with its might,
A light dispelling darkness with its ray,
 A victory won, an intermediate height,
Which seers untrammel'd by their creeds of yore,
 Heroes and saints, triumphantly attained
With hard assail and tribulation sore,
 That we might use the vantage-ground they gain'd.

Scorn not the Old; but hail and seize the New
 With thrill'd intelligences, hearts that burn,
And such truth-seeking spirits that it, too,
 May soon be superseded in its turn,
And men may ever, as the ages roll,
March onward toward the still receding goal.
