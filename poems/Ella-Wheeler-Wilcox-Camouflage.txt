Camouflage is all the rage.
Ladies in their fight with age - 
Soldiers in their fight with foes - 
Demagogues who mask and pose
In the guise of statesmen - girls
Black of eyes with golden curls - 
Politicians, votes in mind,
Smiling, affable and kind,
All use camouflage to-day.
As you go upon your way,
Walk with caution, move with care;
Camouflage is everywhere!
