 Our three cats is Maltese cats,
An' they's two that's white, - 
 An' bofe of 'em's deef - an' that's
'Cause their eyes ain't right. - 


 Uncle say that Huxley say
Eyes of white Maltese - 
 When they don't match thataway - 
They're deef as you please!

 Girls, they like our white cats best,
'Cause they're white as snow,
 Yes, an' look the stylishest - 
But they're deef, you know!

 They don't know their names, an' don't
Hear us when we call
 "Come in, Nick an' Finn!" - they won't
Come fer us at all!

 But our other cat, he knows
Mister Nick an' Finn, - 
 Mowg's his name, - an' when he goes
Fer 'em, they come in!

 Mowgli's all his name - the same
Me an' Muvver took
 Like the Wolf-Child's other name,
In "The Jungul Book."

 I bet Mowg's the smartest cat
In the world! - He's not
 White, but mousy-plush, with that
Smoky gloss he's got!

 All's got little bells to ring,
Round their neck; but none
 Only Mowg knows anything - 
He's the only one!

 I ist 'spect sometimes he hate
White cats' stupid ways: - 
 He won't hardly 'sociate
With 'em, lots o' days!

 Mowg wants in where we air, - well,
He'll ist take his paw
 An' ist ring an' ring his bell
There till me er Ma

 Er somebody lets him in
Nen an' shuts the door. - 
 An', when he wants out ag'in,
Nen he'll ring some more.

 Ort to hear our Katy tell!
She sleeps 'way up-stairs;
 An' last night she hear Mowg's bell
Ringin' round somewheres...

 Trees grows by her winder. - So,
She lean out an' see
 Mowg up there, 'way out, you know,
In the clingstone-tree; - 

 An'-sir! he ist hint an' ring, - 
Till she ketch an' plat
 Them limbs; - nen he crawl an' spring
In where Katy's at!
