title: Nearly Bedtime.
---

Only half an hour or so
Before nurse calls them to bed,
And the ruddy light of a cheerful fire
Shines over each curly head.

No trouble have they, no sorrow -
Their hearts are lighter than air,
No fear that a dark to-morrow
May bring with it want or care.

God send them each on their pathway
Many a wayside flower;
And grant, in the evening of lifetime,
The joy of the evening hour.
