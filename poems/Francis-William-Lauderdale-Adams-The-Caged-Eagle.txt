 . . . I went the other day
 To see the birds and beasts they keep enmewed
 In the London Zoo. One of the first I saw - 
 One of the first I noticed, was an eagle.
 Ragged, befouled, within his iron bars
 He sat without a movement or a sound,
 And, when I stood and pitying looked at him,
 I saw his great sad eyes that winkless gazed
 Out to the horizon sky. I passed from there,
 And walked about the gardens, hither and thither,
 Till all the afternoon was spent. Returning then
 To seek my home, again by chance I passed
 The eagle's cage, and stood again, and looked,
 And saw his great sad eyes that winkless gazed
 Out to the horizon sky. So I went home . . .
 The eagle is Ireland!
