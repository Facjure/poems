Upon Bottle Miche the autre day
While yet the nuit was early,
Je met a homme whose barbe was grey,
Whose cheveaux long and curly.

�Je am a poete, sir,� dit he,
�Je live where tres grande want teems,
I�m faim, sir. Sil vous plait give me
Un franc or cinquatite centimes.�

I donne him vingt big copper sous
But dit, �You moderne rhymers
The sacre poet name abuse,
Les poets were old timers.�

�Je know! I know!� he wept, contrite;
�The bards no more suis mighty:
Ils rise no more in eleve flight,
Though some are beaucoup flighty.

�Vous wonder why Je weep this way,
Pour quoi these tears and blubbers?
It is mon fault les bards today
Helas! suis mere earth-grubbers.

�There was a time when tout might see
My grande flights dans the saddle;
Crowned rois, indeed, applauded me
Le Pegasus astraddle.

�Le winged horse avec acclaim
Was voted mon possession;
Je rode him tous les jours to fame;
Je led the whole procession.

�Then arrivee the Prussian war,
The siege, the sacre famine,
Then some had but a crust encore,
We mange the last least ham-an�

�Helas! Mon noble winged steed
Went oft avec no dinner;
On epics il refusee feed
And maigre grew, and thinner!

�Tout food was gone, and dans the street
Each homme sought crusts to sate him,
Joyeux were those with horse�s meat,
And Pegasus! Je ate him!�

My anger then Je could not hide,
To parler scarcely able
�Oh! curses dans you, sir!� Je cried;
�Vous human livery stable!�

He fled! But vous who read this know
Why mon pauvre verse is beaten
By that of cinquante years ago
�Vant Pegasus fut eaten!
