 A little dog disturbed my trust in Heaven.
 I praised most faithfully
 All the great things that be,
 Man�s pain and pleasure even,
 I said though hard this weighing
 Of pains and tears and praying
 He will reward most just.

 I said your bitter weeping man or maid,
 Your tears or laughter
 Shall gain a just Hereafter;
 Meet you the will of God then unafraid,
 Gird you to your trials for God�s abode
 Is open for all sorrow;
 Live for the great to-morrow.
 There passed me on the road

 A little dog with hungry eyes, and sad
 Thin flesh all shivering,
 All sore and quivering,
 Whining beneath the fell disease he had.
 I hurried home and praised God as before
 For thus affording
 To man rewarding,
 The dog was whining outside my door.

 I flung it wide, and said, Come enter in,
 Outcast of God.
 Beneath His rod
 You suffer sore, poor beast, that had no sin.
 Not at my door then must you cry complaining
 Your lot unjust,
 But His who thrust
 You from His door your body maiming.

 Not mine the pleasure that you bear this pain,
 Hurled into being
 Without hope of freeing
 By grief and patience a soul for any gain.
 Thus I reproached God while I tended
 The sores to healing
 A voice stealing
 And whispering out of the beast I friended,

 Said, �God had quickened my flesh, bestowing
 Joys without measure,
 Made for its pleasure,
 An Eden�s garden for ever glowing.
 Gave me to Man, his care and protection
 To gain and to give,
 And bid us so live
 In united bonds of help and affection.

 �Man wrecked our garden, so we were hurled
 Out from the skies
 Of Paradise
 Into the sorrows of a weeping world.
 He forgets my care, I, as God has said,
 Give still affection
 For that connection
 Which into all our bodies life has breathed.

 �And why are you abusing God, and praising
 With mock effacement
 And false abasement
 Your own heart�s kindness, deeming it amazing
 That you should do this duty for my sake,
 Which is His bidding,
 Nor blame for ridding
 Himself of me, your neighbour, he who spake hard words,
 Hard words and drove me forth all sore and ill?�

 Thus while I tended
 This dog I friended
 Gave back my faith in Heaven by God�s will.
