title: The Mountain In Labour.

[1]

 A mountain was in travail pang;
 The country with her clamour rang.
 Out ran the people all, to see,
 Supposing that the birth would be
 A city, or at least a house.
 It was a mouse!

 In thinking of this fable,
 Of story feign'd and false,
 But meaning veritable,
 My mind the image calls
 Of one who writes, "The war I sing
 Which Titans waged against the Thunder-king."[2]
 As on the sounding verses ring,
 What will be brought to birth?
 Why, dearth.
