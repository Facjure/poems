 The wind, that gives the rose a kiss
 With murmured music of the south,
 Hath kissed a sweeter thing than this, 
 The wind, that gives the rose a kiss 
 The perfume of her mouth.

 The brook, that mirrors skies and trees,
 And echoes in a grottoed place,
 Hath held a fairer thing than these, 
 The brook, that mirrors skies and trees, 
 The image of her face.

 O happy wind! O happy brook!
 So dear before, so free of cares!
 How dearer since her kiss and look, 
 O happy wind! O happy brook! 
 Have blessed you unawares!
