Memories of happy school-days,
In which we view the years gone by,
Long they last, and long they cheer us - 
Live well the moments as they fly,
Your youth is passing swiftly by.

See, then, Milly, that your school-days
Can no mem'ries sad retain.
Onward! upward! be your motto,
Try and try, and try again,
The future will reward the pain.
