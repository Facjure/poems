 Calling, the heron flies athwart the blue
 That sleeps above it; reach on rocky reach
 Of water sings by sycamore and beech,
 In whose warm shade bloom lilies not a few.
 It is a page whereon the sun and dew
 Scrawl sparkling words in dawn's delicious speech;
 A laboratory where the wood-winds teach,
 Dissect each scent and analyze each hue.
 Not otherwise than beautiful, doth it
 Record the happ'nings of each summer day;
 Where we may read, as in a catalogue,
 When passed a thresher; when a load of hay;
 Or when a rabbit; or a bird that lit;
 And now a bare-foot truant and his dog.
