 As I lay awake in the white moonlight,
 I heard a sweet singing in the wood - 
'Out of bed,
Sleepyhead,
Put your white foot now,
Here are we,
'Neath the tree,
Singing round the root now!'

 I looked out of window in the white moonlight,
 The trees were like snow in the wood - 
'Come away
Child and play,
Light wi' the gnomies;
In a mound,
Green and round,
That's where their home is!
'Honey sweet,
Curds to eat,
Cream and frumï¿½nty,
Shells and beads,
Poppy seeds,
You shall have plenty.'

 But soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight
 To put on my stocking and my shoe,
 The sweet, sweet singing died sadly away,
 And the light of the morning peep'd through:
 Then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin
 To sing of the buttercups and dew.
