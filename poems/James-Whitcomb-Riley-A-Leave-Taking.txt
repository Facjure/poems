 She will not smile;
She will not stir;
 I marvel while
I look on her.
 The lips are chilly
And will not speak;
 The ghost of a lily
In either cheek.

 Her hair - ah me!
Her hair - her hair!
 How helplessly
My hands go there!
 But my caresses
Meet not hers,
 O golden tresses
That thread my tears!

 I kiss the eyes
On either lid,
 Where her love lies
Forever hid.
 I cease my weeping
And smile and say:
 I will be sleeping
Thus, some day!
