Old Egypt's gods, Osiris, Ammon, Thoth,
 Came on my dream in thunder, and their feet
 Revealed, were as the levin's fire and heat.
The hosts of Rome, the Arab and the Goth
Have left their altars dark, yet stern and wroth
 In olden power they stood, whose wings were fleet,
 And mighty as with strength of storms that meet
In mingled foam of clouds and ocean-froth.

Above my dream, with arch of dreaded wings,
 In judgement and in sentence of what crime
 I knew not, sate the gods outcast of time.
They passed, and lo, a plague of darkness fell,
Unsleeping, and accurst with nameless things,
And dreams that stood the ministers of Hell!
