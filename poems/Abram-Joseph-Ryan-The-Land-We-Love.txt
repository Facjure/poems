title: The Land We Love
---

Land of the gentle and brave!
 Our love is as wide as thy woe;
It deepens beside every grave
 Where the heart of a hero lies low.

Land of the sunniest skies!
 Our love glows the more for thy gloom;
Our hearts, by the saddest of ties,
 Cling closest to thee in thy doom.

Land where the desolate weep
 In a sorrow no voice may console!
Our tears are but streams, making deep
 The ocean of love in our soul.

Land where the victor's flag waves,
 Where only the dead are free!
Each link of the chain that enslaves
 But binds us to them and to thee.

Land where the Sign of the Cross
 Its shadow hath everywhere shed!
We measure our love by thy loss,
 Thy loss by the graves of our dead!
