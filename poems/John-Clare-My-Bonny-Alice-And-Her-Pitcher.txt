title: My Bonny Alice And Her Pitcher
---

 There's a bonny place in Scotland,
 Where a little spring is found;
 There Nature shows her honest face
 The whole year round.
 Where the whitethorn branches, full of may,
 Hung near the fountain's rim,
 Where comes sweet Alice every day
 And dips her pitcher in;
 A gallon pitcher without ear,
 She fills it with the water clear.

 My bonny Alice she is fair;
 There's no such other to be found.
 Her rosy cheek and dark brown hair--
 The fairest maid on Scotland's ground.
 And there the heather's pinhead flowers
 All blossom over bank and brae,
 While Alice passes by the bowers
 To fill her pitcher every day;
 The pitcher brown without an ear
 She dips into the fountain clear.

 O Alice, bonny, sweet, and fair,
 With roses on her cheeks!
 The little birds come drinking there,
 The throstle almost speaks.
 He dips his wings and wimples makes
 Upon the fountain clear,
 Then vanishes among the brakes
 For ever singing near;
 While Alice, listening, stands to hear,
 And dips her pitcher without ear.

 O Alice, bonny Alice, fair,
 Thy pleasant face I love;
 Thy red-rose cheek, thy dark brown hair,
 Thy soft eyes, like a dove.
 I see thee by the fountain stand,
 With the sweet smiling face;
 There's not a maid in all the land
 With such bewitching grace
 As Alice, who is drawing near,
 To dip the pitcher without ear.
