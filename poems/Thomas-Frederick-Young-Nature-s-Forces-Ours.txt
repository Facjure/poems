I see the wild and dashing waves
 Break madly on the shore;
With glee I watch their stately course,
 With joy I hear their roar.
The howling of the wildest storm,
 The shrieking of the gull
Drive quickly all of pain away,
 And all my fears they lull.

I join my feeble voice with theirs,
 Triumphant in its yell,
For evil powers of earth I scorn,
 And all the pow'rs of hell.
Tho' men and devils both unite,
 And all their force combine,
I feel, ye waves and howling winds,
 That all your strength is mine.

For He who holds you in His hand,
 And moulds you to His will,
Can whisper to all hostile pow'rs,
 As to you, "Peace, be still!"
He bends your necks like osiers green,
 Also the necks of men;
Therefore with you I raise my voice,
 And shout aloud, again.

For you are on my side, ye waves,
 And you, ye winds, are mine.
If I but cast off worldly cares,
 If I my will resign.
Then let me feel what I have felt
 Full oft, in days of yore - 
A fearful, joyous pulse of life
 Thrill through me at your roar.

Let me fling on your crests, ye waves,
 My loads of heavy woe,
And on your wings, ye howling winds,
 My cares and sorrows throw.
