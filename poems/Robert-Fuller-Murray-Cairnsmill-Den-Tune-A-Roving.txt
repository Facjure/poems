As I, with hopeless love o'erthrown,
With love o'erthrown, with love o'erthrown,
 And this is truth I tell,
As I, with hopeless love o'erthrown,
Was sadly walking all alone,

I met my love one morning
 In Cairnsmill Den.
One morning, one morning,
One blue and blowy morning,
I met my love one morning
 In Cairnsmill Den.

A dead bough broke within the wood
Within the wood, within the wood,
 And this is truth I tell.
A dead bough broke within the wood,
And I looked up, and there she stood.

I asked what was it brought her there,
What brought her there, what brought her there,
 And this is truth I tell.
I asked what was it brought her there.
Says she, 'To pull the primrose fair.'

Says I, 'Come, let me pull with you,
Along with you, along with you,'
 And this is truth I tell.
Says I, 'Come let me pull with you,
For one is not so good as two.'

But when at noon we climbed the hill,
We climbed the hill, we climbed the hill,
 And this is truth I tell.
But when at noon we climbed the hill,
Her hands and mine were empty still.

And when we reached the top so high,
The top so high, the top so high,
 And this is truth I tell.
And when we reached the top so high
Says I, 'I'll kiss you, if I die!'

I kissed my love in Cairnsmill Den,
In Cairnsmill Den, in Cairnsmill Den,
 And this is truth I tell.
I kissed my love in Cairnsmill Den,
And my love kissed me back again.

I met my love one morning
 In Cairnsmill Den.
One morning, one morning,
One blue and blowy morning,
I met my love one morning
 In Cairnsmill Den.
