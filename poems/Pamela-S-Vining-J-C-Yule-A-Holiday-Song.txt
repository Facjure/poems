Away to the hills, away! - 
There is health in the summer air; - 
The rustling bough, and the bending spray,
And the breath of flowers are there - 
The honey-bee's hum and the wild bird's song,
And sunshine and summer winds all day long!

Away to the hills, away!
There are peace and calmness there - 
White cloudlets floating in light all day
Through the blue transparent air, - 
Rose-tinted mornings and noontides rare,
And sunsets of crimson and gold are there!

Away to the hills, away!
From your weariness and care - 
From toil that has held on with tyrant sway,
To quiet and calmness there;
And bask in the beauty and bloom that fills
The cool, sweet depths of the summer hills!
