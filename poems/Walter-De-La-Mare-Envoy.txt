 There clung three roses to a stem,
 Did all their hues of summer don,
 But came a wind and troubled them,
And all were gone.

 I heard three bells in unison
 Clap out some transient heart's delight,
 Time and the hour brought silence on
And the dark night.

 Doth not Orion even set!
 O love, love, prove true alone,
 Till youthful hearts ev'n love forget,
Then, child, begone!
