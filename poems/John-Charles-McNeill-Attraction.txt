 He who wills life wills its condition sweet,
 Having made love its mother, joy its quest,
 That its perpetual sequence might not rest
 On reason's dictum, cold and too discreet;

 For reason moves with cautious, careful feet,
 Debating whether life or death were best,
 And why pale pain, not ruddy mirth, is guest
 In many a heart which life hath set to beat.

 But I will cast my fate with love, and trust
 Her honeyed heart that guides the pollened bee
 And sets the happy wing-seeds fluttering free;

 And I will bless the law which saith, Thou must!
 And, wet with sea or shod with weary dust,
 Will follow back and back and back to thee!
