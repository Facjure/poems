title: The Acorn And The Pumpkin.
---

 God's works are good. This truth to prove
 Around the world I need not move;
 I do it by the nearest pumpkin.
 'This fruit so large, on vine so small,'
 Surveying once, exclaim'd a bumpkin - 
 'What could He mean who made us all?
 He's left this pumpkin out of place.
 If I had order'd in the case,
 Upon that oak it should have hung - 
 A noble fruit as ever swung
 To grace a tree so firm and strong.
 Indeed, it was a great mistake,
 As this discovery teaches,
 That I myself did not partake
 His counsels whom my curate preaches.
 All things had then in order come;
 This acorn, for example,
 Not bigger than my thumb,
 Had not disgraced a tree so ample.
 The more I think, the more I wonder
 To see outraged proportion's laws,
 And that without the slightest cause;
 God surely made an awkward blunder.'
 With such reflections proudly fraught,
 Our sage grew tired of mighty thought,
 And threw himself on Nature's lap,
 Beneath an oak, - to take his nap.
 Plump on his nose, by lucky hap,
 An acorn fell: he waked, and in
 The matted beard that graced his chin,
 He found the cause of such a bruise
 As made him different language use.
 'O! O!' he cried; 'I bleed! I bleed!
 And this is what has done the deed!
 But, truly, what had been my fate,
 Had this had half a pumpkin's weight!
 I see that God had reasons good,
 And all his works well understood.'
 Thus home he went in humbler mood.[1]
