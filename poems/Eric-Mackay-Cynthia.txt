Cynthia.


O Lady Moon, elect of all the spheres
 To be the guardian of the ocean-tides,
I charge thee, say, by all thy hopes and fears,
 And by thy face, the oracle of brides,
 Why evermore Remorse with thee abides?
Is life a bane to thee, and fraught with tears,
 That thus forlorn and sad thou dost confer
With ghosts and shades? Perchance thou dost aspire
To bridal honours, and thy Phoebus-sire
 Forbids the banns, whoe'er thy suitor be?
Is this thy grievance, O thou chief of nuns?
 Or dost thou weep to know that Jupiter
Hath many moons - his daughters and his sons -
 And Earth, thy mother, only one in thee?
