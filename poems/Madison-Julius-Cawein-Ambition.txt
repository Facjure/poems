 Now to my lips lift then some opiate
 Of black forgetfulness! while in thy gaze
 Still lures the loveless beauty that betrays,
 And in thy mouth the music that is hate.
 No promise more hast thou to make me wait;
 No smile to cozen my sick heart with praise!
 Far, far behind thee stretch laborious days,
 And far before thee, labors soon and late.
 Thine is the fen-fire that we deem a star,
 Flying before us, ever fugitive,
 Thy mocking policy still holds afar:
 And thine the voice, to which our longings give
 Hope's siren face, that speaks us sweet and fair,
 Only to lead us captives to Despair.
