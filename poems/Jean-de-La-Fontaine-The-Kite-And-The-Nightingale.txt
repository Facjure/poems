[1]

 A noted thief, the kite,
 Had set a neighbourhood in fright,
 And raised the clamorous noise
 Of all the village boys,
 When, by misfortune, - sad to say, - 
 A nightingale fell in his way.
 Spring's herald begg'd him not to eat
 A bird for music - not for meat.
 'O spare!' cried she, 'and I'll relate
 'The crime of Tereus and his fate.' - 
 'What's Tereus?[2] Is it food for kites?' - 
 'No, but a king, of female rights
 The villain spoiler, whom I taught
 A lesson with repentance fraught;
 And, should it please you not to kill,
 My song about his fall
 Your very heart shall thrill,
 As it, indeed, does all.' - 
 Replied the kite, a 'pretty thing!
 When I am faint and famishing,
 To let you go, and hear you sing?' - 
 'Ah, but I entertain the king!' - 
 'Well, when he takes you, let him hear
 Your tale, full wonderful, no doubt;
 For me, a kite, I'll go without.'
 An empty stomach hath no ear.[3]
