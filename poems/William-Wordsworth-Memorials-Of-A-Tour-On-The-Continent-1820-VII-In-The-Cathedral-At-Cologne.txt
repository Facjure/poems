 O for the help of Angels to complete
 This Temple, Angels governed by a plan
 Thus far pursued (how gloriously!) by Man,
 Studious that He might not disdain the seat
 Who dwells in heaven! But that aspiring heat
 Hath failed; and now, ye Powers! whose gorgeous wings
 And splendid aspect yon emblazonings
 But faintly picture, 'twere an office meet
 For you, on these unfinished shafts to try
 The midnight virtues of your harmony:
 This vast design might tempt you to repeat
 Strains that call forth upon empyrean ground
 Immortal Fabrics, rising to the sound
 Of penetrating harps and voices sweet!
