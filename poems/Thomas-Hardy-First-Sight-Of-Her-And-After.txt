title: First Sight Of Her And After
---

A day is drawing to its fall
 I had not dreamed to see;
The first of many to enthrall
 My spirit, will it be?
Or is this eve the end of all
 Such new delight for me?

I journey home: the pattern grows
 Of moonshades on the way:
"Soon the first quarter, I suppose,"
 Sky-glancing travellers say;
I realize that it, for those,
 Has been a common day.
