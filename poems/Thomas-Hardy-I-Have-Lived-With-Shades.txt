title: I Have Lived With Shades
---

I

I have lived with shades so long,
And talked to them so oft,
Since forth from cot and croft
I went mankind among,
 That sometimes they
 In their dim style
 Will pause awhile
 To hear my say;

II

And take me by the hand,
And lead me through their rooms
In the To-be, where Dooms
Half-wove and shapeless stand:
 And show from there
 The dwindled dust
 And rot and rust
 Of things that were.

III

"Now turn," spake they to me
One day: "Look whence we came,
And signify his name
Who gazes thence at thee." -
 - "Nor name nor race
 Know I, or can,"
 I said, "Of man
 So commonplace.

IV

"He moves me not at all;
I note no ray or jot
Of rareness in his lot,
Or star exceptional.
 Into the dim
 Dead throngs around
 He'll sink, nor sound
 Be left of him."

V

"Yet," said they, "his frail speech,
Hath accents pitched like thine -
Thy mould and his define
A likeness each to each -
 But go! Deep pain
 Alas, would be
 His name to thee,
 And told in vain!"
