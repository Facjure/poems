"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."


I gave myself to Jesus
In my sunny childhood's years,
When on my young, unsullied cheek
There lay no trace of tears;
I little knew what gift I gave,
Nor yet what gift I took;
For life without and life within
Were each a sealed-up book.

But soon enough unfolding years
Brought sorrow, toil, and pain, - 
Brought disappointment's burning tears,
And yearnings wild and vain;
And then I learned what precious Gift
In Jesus I received
In that still hour of childish trust,
When my young heart believed.

'Twas then I knew what arm unseen
Was round me 'mid the strife,
The blighted hope, the toil uncheered,
The cold, rude storms of life;
And when the reeds on which I leaned
All failed me one by one,
I clasped my pierced and bleeding hands,
And wept, but not alone.

For He was near me midst the strife,
And, leaning on His arm,
I trod the thorny paths of life,
Safe sheltered from all harm;
The while He whispered to my heart,
"I gave my life for thee!
Then, heavy laden as thou art,
Cast all thy care on me!"

"On me! ON ME!" - oh, gentle word! - 
O Sympathy divine! - 
O Fount of joy, how deeply stirred,
Within this heart of mine! - 
O cool, sweet Waters, how ye stilled
The fever of my brain, - 
And soothed the heart-strings that had thrilled
With agonizing pain!

My own, - My Rock! - the heavy tide
May beat in uproar dread,
Calmly 'gainst its unmoving side
I rest my weary head; - 
For well I know how deep it strikes
Beneath the raging flood - 
My Soul's firm Anchor 'mid the strife,
My Refuge and my God!
