O lyrist of the lowly and the true,
 The song I sought for you
Hides yet unsung. What hope for me to find,
 Lost in the dï¿½dal mind,
The living utterance with lovely tongue!
 To say, as erst was sung
By Ariosto of Knight-errantry,
 Through lands of Poesy,
Song's Paladin, knight of the dream and day,
 The wizard shield you sway
Of that Atlantes power, sweet and terse,
 The skyey-builded verse:
The shield that dazzles, brilliant with surprise,
 Our unanointed eyes.
Oh, had I written as 't were worthy you,
 Each line, a spark of dew,
As once Ferdusi shone in Persia,
 Had strung each rosy spray
Of the unfolding flower of each song;
 And Iran's bulbul tongue
Had sobbed its heart out o'er the fountain's slab
 In gardens of Afrasiab.
