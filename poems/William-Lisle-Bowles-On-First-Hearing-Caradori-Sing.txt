title: On First Hearing Caradori Sing.
---

 Spirit of beauty, and of heavenly song!
 No longer seek in vain, 'mid the loud throng,
 'Mid the discordant tumults of mankind,
 One spirit, gentle as thyself, to find.

 Oh! listen, and suspend thy upward wings,
 Listen - for, hark! 'tis Caradori sings;
 Hear, on the cadence of each thrilling note,
 Airs scarce of earth, and sounds seraphic float!

 See, in the radiant smile that lights her face;
 See, in that form, a more than magic grace;
 And say (repaid for every labour past)
 Beautiful spirit, thou art found at last!
