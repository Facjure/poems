Gone is the glory from the hills,
 The autumn sunshine from the mere,
 Which mourns for the declining year
In all her tributary rills.

A sense of change obscurely chills
 The misty twilight atmosphere,
 In which familiar things appear
Like alien ghosts, foreboding ills.

The twilight hour a month ago
 Was full of pleasant warmth and ease,
The pearl of all the twenty-four.
Erelong the winter gales shall blow,
 Erelong the winter frosts shall freeze--
And oh, that it were June once more!
