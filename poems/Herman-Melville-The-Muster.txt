 The Abrahamic river - 
 Patriarch of floods,
 Calls the roll of all his streams
 And watery mutitudes:
 Torrent cries to torrent,
 The rapids hail the fall;
 With shouts the inland freshets
 Gather to the call.

 The quotas of the Nation,
 Like the water-shed of waves,
 Muster into union - 
 Eastern warriors, Western braves.

 Martial strains are mingling,
 Though distant far the bands,
 And the wheeling of the squadrons
 Is like surf upon the sands.

 The bladed guns are gleaming - 
 Drift in lengthened trim,
 Files on files for hazy miles - 
 Nebulously dim.

 O Milky Way of armies - 
 Star rising after star,
 New banners of the Commonwealths,
 And eagles of the War.

 The Abrahamic river
 To sea-wide fullness fed,
 Pouring from the thaw-lands
 By the God of floods is led:
 His deep enforcing current
 The streams of ocean own,
 And Europe's marge is evened
 By rills from Kansas lone.
 
 17. According to a report of the Secretary of War, there were on the first day of March, 1865, 965,000 men on the army pay-rolls. Of these, some 200,000 - artillery, cavalry, and infantry - made up from the larger portion of the veterans of Grant and Sherman, marched by the President. The total number of Union troops enlisted during the war was 2,668,000.
