Let us halt now for a space in our hurrying;
Let us take time to look up and look out;
Let us refuse for a spell to be worrying;
Let us decline to both question and doubt.
If one goes cavilling,
Hair splitting, flaw hunting - ready for strife - 
All the best pleasure is missed in the travelling
Onward through life.

Just for to-day we will put away sorrowing - 
Just for to-day not a tear shall be shed;
Nor will we fear anything, or go borrowing
Pain from the future by profitless dread.
Thought shall go frolicking,
Pleasuring, treasuring everything bright - 
Tasting the joy that is found just in rollicking
On through the light.

Just for to-day all the ills that need bettering
We will omit from our notebook of mind;
All that is good we will mark by red-lettering; - 
Those things alone we are seeking to find.
Things to be sad over,
Pine over, whine over - pass them, I say!
Nothing is noted save what we are glad over - 
This is Praise Day.
