Look in the eyes of trouble with a smile,
 Extend your hand and do not be afraid.
 'Tis but a friend who comes to masquerade.
And test your faith and courage for awhile.

Fly, and he follows fast with threat and jeer.
 Shrink, and he deals hard blow on stinging blow,
 But bid him welcome as a friend, and lo!
The jest is off - the masque will disappear.
