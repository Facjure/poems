My father he died, but I can't tell you how,
He left me six horses to drive in my plough:
With my wing wang waddle oh,
Jack sing saddle oh,
Blowsey boys bubble oh,
Under the broom.

I sold my six horses and I bought me a cow;
I'd fain have made a fortune but did not know how:
With my, &amp;c.

I sold my cow, and I bought me a calf;
I'd fain have made a fortune, but lost the best half:
With my, &amp;c.

I sold my calf, and I bought me a cat;
A pretty thing she was, in my chimney corner sat:
With my, &amp;c.

I sold my cat, and bought me a mouse;
He carried fire in his tail, and burnt down my house:
With my, &amp;c.
