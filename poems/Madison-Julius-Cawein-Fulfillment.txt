 Yes, there are some who may look on these
 Essential peoples of the earth and air
 That have the stars and flowers in their care
 And all their soul-suggestive secrecies:
 Heart-intimates and comrades of the trees,
 Who from them learn, what no known schools declare,
 God's knowledge; and from winds, that discourse there,
 God's gospel of diviner mysteries:
 To whom the waters shall divulge a word
 Of fuller faith; the sunset and the dawn
 Preach sermons more inspired even than
 The tongues of Penticost; as, distant heard
 In forms of change, through Nature upward drawn,
 God doth address th' immortal soul of Man.
