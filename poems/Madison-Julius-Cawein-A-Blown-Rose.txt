title: A Blown Rose.

Lay but a finger on
 That pallid petal sweet,
It trembles gray and wan
 Beneath the passing feet.

But soft! blown rose, we know
 A merriment of bloom,
A life of sturdy glow, - 
 But no such dear perfume.

As some good bard, whose page
 Of life with beauty's fraught,
Grays on to ripe old age
 Sweet-mellowed through with thought.

So when his hoary head
 Is wept into the tomb,
The mind, which is not dead,
 Sheds round it rare perfume.
