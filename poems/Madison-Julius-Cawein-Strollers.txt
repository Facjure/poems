I.

 We have no castles,
 We have no vassals,
 We have no riches, no gems and no gold;
 Nothing to ponder,
 Nothing to squander
 Let us go wander
 As minstrels of old.


II.

 You with your lute, love,
 I with my flute, love,
 Let us make music by mountain and sea;
 You with your glances,
 I with my dances,
 Singing romances
 Of old chivalry.


III.

 "Derry down derry!
 Good folk, be merry!
 Hither, and hearken where happiness is!
 Never go borrow
 Care of to-morrow,
 Never go sorrow
 While life hath a kiss."


IV.

 Let the day gladden
 Or the night sadden,
 We will be merry in sunshine or snow;
 You with your rhyme, love,
 I with my chime, love,
 We will make time, love,
 Dance as we go.


V.

 Nothing is ours,
 Only the flowers,
 Meadows, and stars, and the heavens above;
 Nothing to lie for,
 Nothing to sigh for,
 Nothing to die for
 While still we have love.


VI.

 "Derry down derry!
 Good folk, be merry!
 Hither, and hearken a word that is sooth:
 Care ye not any,
 If ye have many
 Or not a penny,
 If still ye have youth!"
