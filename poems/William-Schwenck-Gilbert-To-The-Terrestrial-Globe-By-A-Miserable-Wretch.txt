Roll on, thou ball, roll on!
Through pathless realms of Space
 Roll on!
What, though I'm in a sorry case?
What, though I cannot meet my bills?
What, though I suffer toothache's ills?
What, though I swallow countless pills?
Never you mind!
 Roll on!

Roll on, thou ball, roll on!
Through seas of inky air
 Roll on!
It's true I've got no shirts to wear;
It's true my butcher's bill is due;
It's true my prospects all look blue 
But don't let that unsettle you!
Never you mind!
 Roll on!

 (It rolls on.)
