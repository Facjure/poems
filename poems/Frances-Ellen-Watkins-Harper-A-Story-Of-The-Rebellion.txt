 The treacherous sands had caught our boat,
 And held it with a strong embrace
 And death at our imprisoned crew
 Was sternly looking face to face.

 With anxious hearts, but failing strength,
 We strove to push the boat from shore;
 But all in vain, for there we lay
 With bated breath and useless oar.

 Around us in a fearful storm
 The fiery hail fell thick and fast;
 And we engirded by the sand,
 Could not return the dreadful blast.

 When one arose upon whose brow
 The ardent sun had left his trace,
 A noble purpose strong and high
 Uplighting all his dusky face.

 Perchance within that fateful hour
 The wrongs of ages thronged apace;
 But with it came the glorious hope
 Of swift deliverance to his race.

 Of galling chains asunder rent,
 Of severed hearts again made one,
 Of freedom crowning all the land
 Through battles gained and victories won.

 "Some one," our hero firmly said,
 "Must die to get us out of this;"
 Then leaped upon the strand and bared
 His bosom to the bullets' hiss.

 "But ye are soldiers, and can fight,
 May win in battles yet unfought;
 I have no offering but my life,
 And if they kill me it is nought."

 With steady hands he grasped the boat,
 And boldly pushed it from the shore;
 Then fell by rebel bullets pierced,
 His life work grandly, nobly o'er.

 Our boat was rescued from the sands
 And launched in safety on the tide;
 But he our comrade good and grand,
 In our defence had bravely died.
