title: In the Tuberculosis Sanitarium
---

Many sick people are walking in the garden
Back and forth and lying in the porches.
Those who are the sickest burn with fever
Every wretched day in the hot
Grave of their beds.
Ah, Catholic sisters float
Around wearily in black clothes.
Yesterday someone died.Today another can die.
In the city Fasching is begin celebrated.
I would like to be able to play the difference
On the piano.
