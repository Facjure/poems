title: To Carrey Clavel

You turn your back, you turn your back,
 And never your face to me,
Alone you take your homeward track,
 And scorn my company.

What will you do when Charley's seen
 Dewbeating down this way?
- You'll turn your back as now, you mean?
 Nay, Carrey Clavel, nay!

You'll see none's looking; put your lip
 Up like a tulip, so;
And he will coll you, bend, and sip:
 Yes, Carrey, yes; I know!
