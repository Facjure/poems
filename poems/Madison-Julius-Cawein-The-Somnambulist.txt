 Oaks and a water. By the water-eyes,
 Ice-green and steadfast as cold stars; and hair
 Yellow as eyes deep in a she-wolf's lair;
 And limbs, like darkness that the lightning dyes.
 The humped oaks stand black under iron skies;
 The dry wind whirls the dead leaves everywhere;
 Wild on the water falls a vulture glare
 Of moon, and wild the circling raven flies.
 Again the power of this thing hath laid
 Illusion on him: and he seems to hear
 A sweet voice calling him beyond his gates
 To longed-for love; he comes; each forest glade
 Seems reaching out white arms to draw him near
 Nearer and nearer to the death that waits.
