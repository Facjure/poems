 Near Martinpuisch that night of hell
 Two men were struck by the same shell,
 Together tumbling in one heap
 Senseless and limp like slaughtered sheep.

 One was a pale eighteen-year-old,
 Girlish and thin and not too bold,
 Pressed for the war ten years too soon,
 The shame and pity of his platoon.

 The other came from far-off lands
 With bristling chin and whiskered hands,
 He had known death and hell before
 In Mexico and Ecuador.

 Yet in his death this cut-throat wild
 Groaned "Mother!Mother!" like a child,
 While that poor innocent in man's clothes
 Died cursing God with brutal oaths.

 Old Sergeant Smith, kindest of men,
 Wrote out two copies there and then
 Of his accustomed funeral speech
 To cheer the womenfolk of each.
