title: The Pride That Comes After
---

It knows it all, it knows it all,
The world of groans and laughter,
It sneers of pride before a fall,
But the bitter pride comes after:
So leave me and I�ll seek you not,
So seek me and you�ll find me,
But till I know your hand-grip�s true
I�ll stand with hands behind me.

It knows it all, it knows it all,
The world of lies and sorrow,
It prates of pride before a fall,
And of the humble morrow;
But shame and blame are but a name,
Oh, heart that�s hurt past curing!
We�ll drink to-night the sinner�s pride,
The pride that�s most enduring.

They know it all, they know it all,
The curs that pass the sentence.
They preach of pride before a fall
And bitter black repentance:
So leave me when my star is set,
I�ll glory that you leave me,
While one has pride to love me yet
There�s nought on earth shall grieve me.
