Morn hath a secret that she never tells:
'Tis on her lips and in her maiden eyes - 
I think it is the way to Paradise,
Or of the Fount of Youth the crystal wells.
The bee hath no such honey in her cells
Sweet as the balm that in her bosom lies,
As in her garden of the budding skies
She walks among the silver asphodels.

He that is loveless and of heart forlorn,
Let him but leave behind his haunted bed,
 And set his feet toward yonder singing star,
Shall have for sweetheart this same secret morn;
 She shall come running to him from afar,
And on her cool breast lay his lonely head.
