title: I Am The Way
---

 Thou art the Way.
Hadst Thou been nothing but the goal,
 I cannot say
If Thou hadst ever met my soul.

 I cannot see--
I, child of process--if there lies
 An end for me,
Full of repose, full of replies.

 I'll not reproach
The way that goes, my feet that stir.
 Access, approach,
Art Thou, time, way, and wayfarer.
