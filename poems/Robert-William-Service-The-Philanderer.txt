 Oh, have you forgotten those afternoons
 With riot of roses and amber skies,
 When we thrilled to the joy of a million Junes,
 And I sought for your soul in the deeps of your eyes?
 I would love you, I promised, forever and aye,
 And I meant it too; yet, oh, isn't it odd?
 When we met in the Underground to-day
 I addressed you as Mary instead of as Maude.

 Oh, don't you remember that moonlit sea,
 With us on a silver trail afloat,
 When I gracefully sank on my bended knee
 At the risk of upsetting our little boat?
 Oh, I vowed that my life was blighted then,
 As friendship you proffered with mournful mien;
 But now as I think of your children ten,
 I'm glad you refused me, Evangeline.

 Oh, is that moment eternal still
 When I breathed my love in your shell-like ear,
 And you plucked at your fan as a maiden will,
 And you blushed so charmingly, Guenivere?
 Like a worshiper at your feet I sat;
 For a year and a day you made me mad;
 But now, alas! you are forty, fat,
 And I think: What a lucky escape I had!

 Oh, maidens I've set in a sacred shrine,
 Oh, Rosamond, Molly and Mignonette,
 I've deemed you in turn the most divine,
 In turn you've broken my heart . . . and yet
 It's easily mended. What's past is past.
 To-day on Lucy I'm going to call;
 For I'm sure that I know true love at last,
 And She is the fairest girl of all.
