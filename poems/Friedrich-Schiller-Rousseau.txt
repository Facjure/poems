 Monument of our own age's shame,
 On thy country casting endless blame,
 Rousseau's grave, how dear thou art to me
 Calm repose be to thy ashes blest!
 In thy life thou vainly sought'st for rest,
 But at length 'twas here obtained by thee!

 When will ancient wounds be covered o'er?
 Wise men died in heathen days of yore;
 Now 'tis lighter yet they die again.
 Socrates was killed by sophists vile,
 Rousseau meets his death through Christians' wile,
 Rousseau who would fain make Christians men!
