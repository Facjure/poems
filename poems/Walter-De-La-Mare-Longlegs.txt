Longlegs - he yelled 'Coo-ee!'
And all across the combe
Shrill and shrill it rang - rang through
The clear green gloom.
Fairies there were a-spinning,
And a white tree-maid
Lifted her eyes, and listened
In her rain-sweet glade.
Bunnie to bunnie stamped; old Wat
Chin-deep in bracken sate;
A throstle piped, 'I'm by, I'm by!'
Clear to his timid mate.
And there was Longlegs, straddling,
And hearkening was he,
To distant Echo thrilling back
A thin 'Coo-ee!'
