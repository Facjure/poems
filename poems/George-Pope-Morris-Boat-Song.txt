Pull away merrily--over the waters!
Bend to your oars for the wood-tangled shore;
We're off and afloat with earth's loveliest daughters,
Worth all the argosies wave ever bore.
Pull away gallantly--pull away valiantly--
Pull with a swoop, boys; and pull for the shore:
Merrily, merrily, bend to the oar!

Pull away cheerily!--land is before us--
Green groves are flinging their balm to the spray;
The sky, like the spirit of love, bending o'er us,
Lights her bright torches to show us the way.
Pull away charily--pull away warily--
Pull with a nerve, boys; together give way:
Merrily, merrily, pull to the lay!

Pull away heartily--light winds are blowing,
Crisping the ripples that dance at our side;
The moon bathes in silver the path we are going,
And night is arrayed in her robes like a bride.
Pull away readily--pull away steadily--
Pull with a will, boys, and sing as we glide
Merrily, merrily, over the tide!
