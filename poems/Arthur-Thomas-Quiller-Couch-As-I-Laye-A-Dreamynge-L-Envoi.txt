After T. I.

 As I laye a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge,
 O softlye moaned the dove to her mate within the tree,
And meseemed unto my syghte
Came rydynge many a knyghte
All cased in armoure bryghte
Cap-a-pie,
 As I laye a-dreamynge, a goodlye companye!

 As I laye a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge,
 O sadlye mourned the dove, callynge long and callynge lowe,
And meseemed of alle that hoste
Notte a face but was the ghoste
Of a friend that I hadde loste
Long agoe.
As I laye a-dreamynge, oh, bysson teare to flowe!

 As I laye a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge,
 O sadlye sobbed the dove as she seemed to despayre,
And laste upon the tracke
Came one I hayled as 'Jacke!'
But he turned mee his backe
With a stare:
 As I laye a-dreamynge, he lefte mee callynge there.

 Stille I laye a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge,
 And gentler sobbed the dove as it eased her of her payne,
And meseemed a voyce yt cry'd--
 'They shall ryde, and they shall ryde
 'Tyll the truce of tyme and tyde
Come agayne!
 Alle for Eldorado, yette never maye attayne!'

 Stille I laye a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge, a-dreamynge,
 And scarcelye moaned the dove, as her agonye was spente:
 'Shalle to-morrowe see them nygher
To a golden walle or spyre?
You have better in yr fyre,
Bee contente.'
 As I laye a-dreamynge, it seem'd smalle punyshment.

 But I laye a-wakynge, and loe! the dawne was breakynge
 And rarely pyped a larke for the promyse of the daye:
 'Uppe and sette yr lance in reste!
Uppe and followe on the queste!
Leave the issue to be guessed
 At the endynge of the waye'--

 As I laye a-wakynge, 'twas soe she seemed to say--
'Whatte and if it alle be feynynge?
 There be better thynges than gaynynge,
 Rycher pryzes than attaynynge.'--
And 'twas truthe she seemed to saye.
 Whyles the dawne was breakynge, I rode upon my waye.
