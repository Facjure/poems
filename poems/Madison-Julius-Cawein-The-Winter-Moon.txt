 Deep in the dell I watched her as she rose,
 A face of icy fire, o'er the hills;
 With snow-sad eyes to freeze the forest rills,
 And snow-sad feet to bleach the meadow snows:
 Pale as some young witch who, a-listening, goes
 To her first meeting with the Fiend; whose fears
 Fix demon eyes behind each bush she nears;
 Stops, yet must on, fearful of following foes.
 And so I chased her, startled in the wood,
 Like a discovered Oread, who flies
 The Faun who found her sleeping, each nude limb
 Glittering betrayal through the solitude;
 Till in a frosty cloud I saw her swim,
 Like a drowned face, a blur beneath the ice.
