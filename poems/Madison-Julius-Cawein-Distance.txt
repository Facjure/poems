 I.

I dreamed last night once more I stood
 Knee-deep in purple clover leas;
Your old home glimmered thro' its wood
 Of dark and melancholy trees,
 Where ev'ry sudden summer breeze
That wantoned o'er the solitude
The water's melody pursued,
 And sleepy hummings of the bees.


 II.

And ankle-deep in violet blooms
 Methought I saw you standing there,
A lawny light among the glooms,
 A crown of sunlight on your hair;
 Wild songsters singing every where
Made lightning with their glossy plumes;
About you clung the wild perfumes
 And swooned along the shining air.


 III.

And then you called me, and my ears
 Grew flattered with the music, led
In fancy back to sweeter years,
 Far sweeter years that now are dead;
 And at your summons fast I sped,
Buoyant as one a goal who nears.
Ah! lost, dead love! I woke in tears;
 For as I neared you farther fled!
