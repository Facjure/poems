On the tremulous coppice,
 From her plenteous hair,
Large golden-rayed poppies
 Of moon-litten air
 The Night hath flung there.

In the fern-favored hollow
 The fire-flies fleet
Uncertainly follow
 Pale phantoms of heat,
 Druid shadows that meet.

Hidden flowers are fragrant;
 The night hazes furl
O'er the solitudes vagrant
 In purple and pearl,
 Sway-swinging and curl.

From moss-cushioned valley
 Where the red sunlight fails,
Rocks where musically
 The hollow spring wails,
 And the limber fern trails,

With a ripple and twinkle
 Of luminous arms,
Of voices that tinkle,
 And feet that are storms
 Of chaste, naked charms,

Like echoes that revel
 On hills, where the brier
Vaults roofs of dishevel
 And green, greedy fire,
 They come as a choir.

At the root of the mountain
 Where the dim forest lies,
By the spar-spouting fountain
 Where the low lily dies,
 With their star-stinging eyes.

They gather sweet singing
 In voices that seem
Faint ringing and clinging
 In dreams that we dream,
 In visions that gleam.

Sweet lisping of kisses,
 Dry rustle of hair;
A footfall that hisses
 Like a leaf in the air
 When the brown boughs are bare.

The music that scatters
 From love-litten eyes;
The music that flatters
 In words and low sighs,
 In laughter that dies:

"Come hither, come hither,
 In the million-eyed night,
Ere the moon-flowers wither
 And the harvester white,
 Morning reaps them with light.

"Come hither, where singing
 Is pleasant as tears,
Or dead kisses, clinging
 To the murdering years,
 In memory's ears.

"Come hither where kisses
 Are waiting for you,
For lips and long tresses,
 As for wild flowers blue
 The moon-heated dew.

"Come hither from coppice
 And violet dale,
The mountain whose top is
 In vapors that sail
 With pearly hail pale.

"Why tarry? come hither
 While the molten moon beams,
Ere the golden spark wither
 Of the glow-worm that gleams
 Like a star in still streams!"
