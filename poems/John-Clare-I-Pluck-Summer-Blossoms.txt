title: I Pluck Summer Blossoms
---

 I pluck Summer blossoms,
 And think of rich bosoms--
 The bosoms I've leaned on, and worshipped, and won.
 The rich valley lilies,
 The wood daffodillies,
 Have been found in our rambles when Summer begun.

 Where I plucked thee the bluebell,
 'T was where the night dew fell,
 And rested till morn in the cups of the flowers;
 I shook the sweet posies,
 Bluebells and brere roses,
 As we sat in cool shade in Summer's warm hours.

 Bedlam-cowslips and cuckoos,
 With freck'd lip and hooked nose,
 Growing safe near the hazel of thicket and woods,
 And water blobs, ladies' smocks,
 Blooming where haycocks
 May be found, in the meadows, low places, and floods.

 And cowslips a fair band
 For May ball or garland,
 That bloom in the meadows as seen by the eye;
 And pink ragged robin,
 Where the fish they are bobbing
 Their heads above water to catch at the fly.

 Wild flowers and wild roses!
 'T is love makes the posies
 To paint Summer ballads of meadow and glen.
 Floods can't drown it nor turn it,
 Even flames cannot burn it;
 Let it bloom till we walk the green meadows again.
