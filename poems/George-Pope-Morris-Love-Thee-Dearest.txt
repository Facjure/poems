title: Love Thee, Dearest!
---

Love thee, dearest?--Hear me.--Never
 Will my fond vows be forgot!
May I perish, and for ever,
 When, dear maid, I love thee not!
Turn not from me, dearest!--Listen!
 Banish all thy doubts and fears!
Let thine eyes with transport glisten!
 What hast thou to do with tears?

Dry them, dearest!--Ah, believe me,
 Love's bright flame is burning still!
Though the hollow world deceive thee,
 Here's a heart that never will!
Dost thou smile?--A cloud of sorrow
 Breaks before Joy's rising sun!
Wilt thou give thy hand?--To-morrow,
 Hymen's bond will make us one!
