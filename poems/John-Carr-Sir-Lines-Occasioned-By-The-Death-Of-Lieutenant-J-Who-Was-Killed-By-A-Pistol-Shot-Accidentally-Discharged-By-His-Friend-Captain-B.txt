title: Lines Occasioned By The Death Of Lieutenant J ---- , Who Was Killed By A Pistol-Shot, Accidentally Discharged By His Friend, Captain B ---- .

With horror dumb, tho' guiltless, stood
Beside his dying friend,
The hapless wretch who made the blood
Sad from his side descend!

"Give me thy hand; lov'd friend, adieu!"
The gen'rous suff'rer cried!
"I do forgive and bless thee too;"
And, having said it, died!

And Pity, who stood trembling near
Knew not for which to shed,
So claim'd by both, her saddest tear - 
The living or the dead!
