 Aloll in the warm clear water,
On her back with languorous limbs,
 She lies. The baby upon her breasts
Paddles and falls and swims.

 With half-closed eyes she smiles,
Guarding it with her hands;
 And the sob swells up in my heart - 
In my heart that understands.

 Dear, in the English country,
 The hatefullest land on earth,
 The mothers are starved and the children die,
 And death is better than birth!
