I have seen her limpid eyes
Large with gradual laughter rise
 Through wild-roses' nettles,
Like twin blossoms grow and stare,
Then a hating, envious air
 Whisked them into petals.

I have seen her hardy cheek
Like a molten coral leak
 Through the leafage shaded
Of thick Chickasaws, and then,
When I made more sure, again
 To a red plum faded.

I have found her racy lips,
And her graceful finger-tips,
 But a haw and berry;
Glimmers of her there and here,
Just, forsooth, enough to cheer
 And to make me merry.

Often on the ferny rocks
Dazzling rimples of loose locks
 At me she hath shaken,
And I've followed - 'twas in vain - 
They had trickled into rain
 Sun-lit on the braken.

Once her full limbs flashed on me,
Naked where some royal tree
 Powdered all the spaces
With wan sunlight and quaint shade,
Such a haunt romance hath made
 For haunched satyr-races.

There, I wot, hid amorous Pan,
For a sudden pleading ran
 Through the maze of myrtle,
Whiles a rapid violence tossed
All its flowerage, - 'twas the lost
 Cooings of a turtle.
