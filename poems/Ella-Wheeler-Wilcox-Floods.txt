 In the dark night, from sweet refreshing sleep
 I wake to hear outside my window-pane
 The uncurbed fury of the wild spring rain,
 And weird winds lashing the defiant deep,
 And roar of floods that gather strength and leap
 Down dizzy, wreck-strewn channels to the main.
 I turn upon my pillow and again
 Compose myself for slumber.
 Let them sweep;
 I once survived great floods, and do not fear,
 Though ominous planets congregate, and seem
 To foretell strange disasters.
 From a dream - 
 Ah! dear God! such a dream! - I woke to hear,
 Through the dense shadows lit by no star's gleam,
 The rush of mighty waters on my ear.
 Helpless, afraid, and all alone, I lay;
 The floods had come upon me unaware.
 I heard the crash of structures that were fair;
 The bridges of fond hopes were swept away
 By great salt waves of sorrow. In dismay
 I saw by the red lightning's lurid glare
 That on the rock-bound island of despair
 I had been cast. Till the dim dawn of day
 I heard my castles falling, and the roll
 Of angry billows bearing to the sea
 The broken timbers of my very soul.
 Were all the pent-up waters from the whole
 Stupendous solar system to break free,
 There are no floods that now can frighten me.
