Wail! wail! and smite your lyres' sonorous gold,
 And beckon naked beauty from the sea
In arms and breasts and hips of godly mold,
 Dark, strangling hair carousing to the knee.

In vain! in vain! and dull in unclosed ears
 To one loved voice sweet calling o'er the foam,
Which in my heart like some strong hand appears
 To gently, firmly draw my vessel home.
