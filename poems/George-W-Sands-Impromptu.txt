 On The Reception Of A Letter.

 I would love to have thee near me,
 But when I think how drear
 Is each hope that used to cheer me,
 I cease to wish thee here.

 I know that thou, wouldst not shrink from
 The storms that burst on me,
 But the bitter chalice I drink from,
 I will not pass to thee.

 I would share the world with thee, were it
 With all its pleasures mine,
 But the sorrows which I inherit,
 I never will make thine!
