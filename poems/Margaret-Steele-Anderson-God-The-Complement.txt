("Nor does being weary imply that there is any place to rest.")

Yea, by your wants bestead,
You come Myself to know;
For if I be not bread,
Why hunger so?

And if not water I,
Your fountain last and first,
Why should your earth be dry?
Why should you thirst?

Have you not read desire?
Do you not know your quest?
Spirit, why should you tire
Were I not rest?
