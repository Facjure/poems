When Autumn's here and days are short,
 Let LYDIA laugh and, hey!
Straightway 't is May-day in my heart,
 And blossoms strew the way.

When Summer's here and days are long,
 Let LYDIA sigh and, ho!
December's fields I walk among,
 And shiver in the snow.

No matter what the Seasons are,
 My LYDIA is so dear,
My soul admits no Calendar
 Of earth when she is near.
