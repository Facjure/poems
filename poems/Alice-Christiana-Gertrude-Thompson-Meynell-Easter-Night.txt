 All night had shout of men and cry
 Of woeful women filled His way;
 Until that noon of sombre sky
 On Friday, clamour and display
 Smote Him; no solitude had He,
 No silence, since Gethsemane.

 Public was Death; but Power, but Might,
 But Life again, but Victory,
 Were hushed within the dead of night,
 The shutterï¿½d dark, the secrecy.
 And all alone, alone, alone
 He rose again behind the stone.
