 Argument Of The Second Book.


Jupiter, in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis, deceives Agamemnon by a dream. He, in consequence of it, calls a council, the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle. Thersites is mutinous, and is chastised by Ulysses. Ulysses, Nestor, and Agamemnon, harangue the people; and preparation is made for battle. An exact account follows of the forces on both sides.




 [1]All night both Gods and Chiefs equestrian slept,
 But not the Sire of all. He, waking soon,
 Mused how to exalt Achilles, and destroy
 No few in battle at the Grecian fleet.
 This counsel, at the last, as best he chose
 And likeliest; to dispatch an evil Dream
 To Agamemnon's tent, and to his side
 The phantom summoning, him thus addressed.
 Haste, evil Dream! Fly to the Grecian fleet,
 And, entering royal Agamemnon's tent,
 His ear possess thou thus, omitting nought
 Of all that I enjoin thee. Bid him arm
 His universal host, for that the time
 When the Achaians shall at length possess
 Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above
 No longer dwell at variance. The request
 Of Juno hath prevail'd; now, wo to Troy!
 So charged, the Dream departed. At the ships
 Well-built arriving of Achaia's host,
 He Agamemnon, son of Atreus, sought.
 Him sleeping in his tent he found, immersed
 In soft repose ambrosial. At his head
 The shadow stood, similitude exact
 Of Nestor, son of Neleus; sage, with whom
 In Agamemnon's thought might none compare.
 His form assumed, the sacred Dream began.
 Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms
 And in the race! Sleep'st thou? It ill behoves
 To sleep all night the man of high employ,
 And charged, as thou art, with a people's care.
 Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove,
 Inform thee, that although so far remote,
 He yet compassionates and thinks on thee
 With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm
 Thy universal host, for that the time
 When the Achaians shall at length possess
 Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above
 No longer dwell at variance. The requests
 Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, wo to Troy
 From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing.
 Awaking from thy dewy slumbers, hold
 In firm remembrance all that thou hast heard.
 So spake the Dream, and vanishing, him left
 In false hopes occupied and musings vain.
 Full sure he thought, ignorant of the plan
 By Jove design'd, that day the last of Troy.
 Fond thought! For toils and agonies to Greeks
 And Trojans both, in many a bloody field
 To be endured, the Thunderer yet ordain'd.
 Starting he woke, and seeming still to hear
 The warning voice divine, with hasty leap
 Sprang from his bed, and sat.[2] His fleecy vest
 New-woven he put on, and mantle wide;
 His sandals fair to his unsullied feet
 He braced, and slung his argent-studded sword.
 Then, incorruptible for evermore
 The sceptre of his sires he took, with which
 He issued forth into the camp of Greece.
 Aurora now on the Olympian heights
 Proclaiming stood new day to all in heaven,
 When he his clear-voiced heralds bade convene
 The Greeks in council. Went the summons forth
 Into all quarters, and the throng began.
 First, at the ship of Nestor, Pylian King,[3]
 The senior Chiefs for high exploits renown'd
 He gather'd, whom he prudent thus address'd.
 My fellow warriors, hear! A dream from heaven,
 Amid the stillness of the vacant night
 Approach'd me, semblance close in stature, bulk,
 And air, of noble Nestor. At mine head
 The shadow took his stand, and thus he spake.
 Oh son of Atreus the renown'd in arms
 And in the race, sleep'st thou? It ill behoves
 To sleep all night the man of high employ,
 And charged as thou art with a people's care.
 Now, therefore, mark me well, who, sent from Jove,
 Inform thee, that although so far remote,
 He yet compassionates and thinks on thee
 With kind solicitude. He bids thee arm
 Thy universal host; for that the time
 When the Achaians shall at length possess
 Wide Ilium, hath arrived. The Gods above
 No longer dwell at variance. The requests
 Of Juno have prevail'd. Now, wo to Troy
 From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing.
 Charge this on thy remembrance. Thus he spake,
 Then vanished suddenly, and I awoke.
 Haste therefore, let us arm, if arm we may,[4]
 The warlike sons of Greece; but first, myself
 Will prove them, recommending instant flight
 With all our ships, and ye throughout the host
 Dispersed, shall, next, encourage all to stay.
 He ceased, and sat; when in the midst arose
 Of highest fame for wisdom, Nestor, King
 Of sandy Pylus, who them thus bespake.
 Friends, Counsellors, and Leaders of the Greeks!
 Had any meaner Argive told his dream,
 We had pronounced it false, and should the more
 Have shrunk from battle; but the dream is his
 Who boasts himself our highest in command.
 Haste, arm we, if we may, the sons of Greece.
 So saying, he left the council; him, at once
 The sceptred Chiefs, obedient to his voice,
 Arising, follow'd; and the throng began.
 As from the hollow rock bees stream abroad,
 And in succession endless seek the fields,
 Now clustering, and now scattered far and near,
 In spring-time, among all the new-blown flowers,
 So they to council swarm'd, troop after troop,
 Grecians of every tribe, from camp and fleet
 Assembling orderly o'er all the plain
 Beside the shore of Ocean. In the midst
 A kindling rumor, messenger of Jove,
 Impell'd them, and they went. Loud was the din
 Of the assembling thousands; groan'd the earth
 When down they sat, and murmurs ran around.
 Nine heralds cried aloud--Will ye restrain
 Your clamors, that your heaven-taught Kings may speak?
 Scarce were they settled, and the clang had ceased,
 When Agamemnon, sovereign o'er them all,
 Sceptre in hand, arose. (That sceptre erst
 Vulcan with labor forged, and to the hand
 Consign'd it of the King, Saturnian Jove;
 Jove to the vanquisher[5] of Ino's[6] guard,
 And he to Pelops; Pelops in his turn,
 To royal Atreus; Atreus at his death
 Bequeath'd it to Thyestes rich in flocks,
 And rich Thyestes left it to be borne
 By Agamemnon, symbol of his right
 To empire over Argos and her isles)
 On that he lean'd, and rapid, thus began.[7]
 Friends, Grecian Heroes, ministers of Mars!
 Ye see me here entangled in the snares
 Of unpropitious Jove. He promised once,
 And with a nod confirm'd it, that with spoils
 Of Ilium laden, we should hence return;
 But now, devising ill, he sends me shamed,
 And with diminished numbers, home to Greece.
 So stands his sovereign pleasure, who hath laid
 The bulwarks of full many a city low,
 And more shall level, matchless in his might.
 That such a numerous host of Greeks as we,
 Warring with fewer than ourselves, should find
 No fruit of all our toil, (and none appears)
 Will make us vile with ages yet to come.
 For should we now strike truce, till Greece and Troy
 Might number each her own, and were the Greeks
 Distributed in bands, ten Greeks in each,
 Our banded decads should exceed so far
 Their units, that all Troy could not supply
 For every ten, a man, to fill us wine;
 So far the Achaians, in my thought, surpass
 The native Trojans. But in Troy are those
 Who baffle much my purpose; aids derived
 From other states, spear-arm'd auxiliars, firm
 In the defence of Ilium's lofty towers.
 Nine years have passed us over, nine long years;
 Our ships are rotted, and our tackle marr'd,
 And all our wives and little-ones at home
 Sit watching our return, while this attempt
 Hangs still in doubt, for which that home we left.
 Accept ye then my counsel. Fly we swift
 With all our fleet back to our native land,
 Hopeless of Troy, not yet to be subdued.
 So spake the King, whom all the concourse heard
 With minds in tumult toss'd; all, save the few,
 Partners of his intent. Commotion shook
 The whole assembly, such as heaves the flood
 Of the Icarian Deep, when South and East
 Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove.
 And as when vehement the West-wind falls
 On standing corn mature, the loaded ears
 Innumerable bow before the gale,
 So was the council shaken. With a shout
 All flew toward the ships; uprais'd, the dust
 Stood o'er them; universal was the cry,
 "Now clear the passages, strike down the props,
 Set every vessel free, launch, and away!"
 Heaven rang with exclamation of the host
 All homeward bent, and launching glad the fleet.
 Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen
 Returning premature, but Juno thus,
 With admonition quick to Pallas spake.
 Unconquer'd daughter of Jove �gis-arm'd!
 Ah foul dishonor! Is it thus at last
 That the Achaians on the billows borne,
 Shall seek again their country, leaving here,
 To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,
 Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks
 Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?
 Haste! Seek the mail-arm'd multitude, by force
 Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet
 All launch their oary barks into the flood.
 She spake, nor did Minerva not comply,
 But darting swift from the Olympian heights,
 Reach'd soon Achaia's fleet. There, she perceived
 Prudent as Jove himself, Ulysses; firm
 He stood; he touch'd not even with his hand
 His sable bark, for sorrow whelm'd his soul.
 The Athen�an Goddess azure-eyed
 Beside him stood, and thus the Chief bespake.
 Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!
 Why seek ye, thus precipitate, your ships?
 Intend ye flight? And is it thus at last,
 That the Achaians on the billows borne,
 Shall seek again their country, leaving here,
 To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King,
 Helen of Argos, in whose cause the Greeks
 Have numerous perish'd from their home remote?
 Delay not. Rush into the throng; by force
 Detain them of thy soothing speech, ere yet
 All launch their oary barks into the flood.
 She ceased, whom by her voice Ulysses knew,
 Casting his mantle from him, which his friend
 Eurybates the Ithacensian caught,
 He ran; and in his course meeting the son
 Of Atreus, Agamemnon, from his hand
 The everlasting sceptre quick received,
 Which bearing, through Achaia's fleet he pass'd.
 What King soever, or distinguish'd Greek
 He found, approaching to his side, in terms
 Of gentle sort he stay'd him. Sir, he cried,
 It is unseemly that a man renown'd
 As thou, should tremble. Go--Resume the seat
 Which thou hast left, and bid the people sit.
 Thou know'st not clearly yet the monarch's mind.
 He proves us now, but soon he will chastize.
 All were not present; few of us have heard
 His speech this day in council. Oh, beware,
 Lest in resentment of this hasty course
 Irregular, he let his anger loose.
 Dread is the anger of a King; he reigns
 By Jove's own ordinance, and is dear to Jove,
 But what plebeian base soe'er he heard
 Stretching his throat to swell the general cry,
 He laid the sceptre smartly on his back,
 With reprimand severe. Fellow, he said,
 Sit still; hear others; thy superiors hear.
 For who art thou? A dastard and a drone,
 Of none account in council, or in arms.
 By no means may we all alike bear sway
 At Ilium; such plurality of Kings
 Were evil. One suffices. One, to whom
 The son of politic Saturn hath assign'd
 The sceptre, and inforcement of the laws,
 That he may rule us as a monarch ought.[8]
 With such authority the troubled host
 He sway'd; they, quitting camp and fleet again
 Rush'd back to council; deafening was the sound
 As when a billow of the boisterous deep
 Some broad beach dashes, and the Ocean roars.
 The host all seated, and the benches fill'd,
 Thersites only of loquacious tongue
 Ungovern'd, clamor'd mutinous; a wretch
 Of utterance prompt, but in coarse phrase obscene
 Deep learn'd alone, with which to slander Kings.
 Might he but set the rabble in a roar,
 He cared not with what jest; of all from Greece
 To Ilium sent, his country's chief reproach.
 Cross-eyed he was, and halting moved on legs
 Ill-pair'd; his gibbous shoulders o'er his breast
 Contracted, pinch'd it; to a peak his head
 Was moulded sharp, and sprinkled thin with hair
 Of starveling length, flimsy and soft as down.
 Achilles and Ulysses had incurr'd
 Most his aversion; them he never spared;
 But now, imperial Agamemnon 'self
 In piercing accents stridulous he charged
 With foul reproach. The Grecians with contempt
 Listen'd, and indignation, while with voice
 At highest pitch, he thus the monarch mock'd.
 What wouldst thou now? Whereof is thy complaint
 Now, Agamemnon? Thou hast fill'd thy tents
 With treasure, and the Grecians, when they take
 A city, choose the loveliest girls for thee.
 Is gold thy wish? More gold? A ransom brought
 By some chief Trojan for his son's release
 Whom I, or other valiant Greek may bind?
 Or wouldst thou yet a virgin, one, by right
 Another's claim, but made by force thine own?
 It was not well, great Sir, that thou shouldst bring
 A plague on the Achaians, as of late.
 But come, my Grecian sisters, soldiers named
 Unfitly, of a sex too soft for war,
 Come, let us homeward: let him here digest
 What he shall gorge, alone; that he may learn
 If our assistance profit him or not.
 For when he shamed Achilles, he disgraced
 A Chief far worthier than himself, whose prize
 He now withholds. But tush,--Achilles lacks
 Himself the spirit of a man; no gall
 Hath he within him, or his hand long since
 Had stopp'd that mouth,[9] that it should scoff no more.
 Thus, mocking royal Agamemnon, spake
 Thersites. Instant starting to his side,
 Noble Ulysses with indignant brows
 Survey'd him, and him thus reproved severe.
 Thersites! Railer!--peace. Think not thyself,
 Although thus eloquent, alone exempt
 From obligation not to slander Kings.
 I deem thee most contemptible, the worst
 Of Agamemnon's followers to the war;
 Presume not then to take the names revered
 Of Sovereigns on thy sordid lips, to asperse
 Their sacred character, and to appoint
 The Greeks a time when they shall voyage home.
 How soon, how late, with what success at last
 We shall return, we know not: but because
 Achaia's heroes numerous spoils allot
 To Agamemnon, Leader of the host,
 Thou therefore from thy seat revilest the King.
 But mark me. If I find thee, as even now,
 Raving and foaming at the lips again,
 May never man behold Ulysses' head
 On these my shoulders more, and may my son
 Prove the begotten of another Sire,
 If I not strip thee to that hide of thine
 As bare as thou wast born, and whip thee hence
 Home to thy galley, sniveling like a boy.
 He ceased, and with his sceptre on the back
 And shoulders smote him. Writhing to and fro,
 He wept profuse, while many a bloody whelk
 Protuberant beneath the sceptre sprang.
 Awe-quell'd he sat, and from his visage mean,
 Deep-sighing, wiped the rheums. It was no time
 For mirth, yet mirth illumined every face,
 And laughing, thus they spake. A thousand acts
 Illustrious, both by well-concerted plans
 And prudent disposition of the host
 Ulysses hath achieved, but this by far
 Transcends his former praise, that he hath quell'd
 Such contumelious rhetoric profuse.
 The valiant talker shall not soon, we judge,
 Take liberties with royal names again.[10]
 So spake the multitude. Then, stretching forth
 The sceptre, city-spoiler Chief, arose
 Ulysses. Him beside, herald in form,
 Appeared Minerva. Silence she enjoined
 To all, that all Achaia's sons might hear,
 Foremost and rearmost, and might weigh his words.
 He then his counsel, prudent, thus proposed.
 Atrides! Monarch! The Achaians seek
 To make thee ignominious above all
 In sight of all mankind. None recollects
 His promise more in steed-famed Argos pledged,
 Here to abide till Ilium wall'd to heaven
 Should vanquish'd sink, and all her wealth be ours.
 No--now, like widow'd women, or weak boys,
 They whimper to each other, wishing home.
 And home, I grant, to the afflicted soul
 Seems pleasant.[11] The poor seaman from his wife
 One month detain'd, cheerless his ship and sad
 Possesses, by the force of wintry blasts,
 And by the billows of the troubled deep
 Fast lock'd in port. But us the ninth long year
 Revolving, finds camp'd under Ilium still.
 I therefore blame not, if they mourn beside
 Their sable barks, the Grecians. Yet the shame
 That must attend us after absence long
 Returning unsuccessful, who can bear?
 Be patient, friends! wait only till we learn
 If Calchas truly prophesied, or not;
 For well we know, and I to all appeal,
 Whom Fate hath not already snatch'd away,
 (It seems but yesterday, or at the most
 A day or two before) that when the ships
 Wo-fraught for Priam, and the race of Troy,
 At Aulis met, and we beside the fount
 With perfect hecatombs the Gods adored
 Beneath the plane-tree, from whose root a stream
 Ran crystal-clear, there we beheld a sign
 Wonderful in all eyes. A serpent huge,
 Tremendous spectacle! with crimson spots
 His back all dappled, by Olympian Jove
 Himself protruded, from the altar's foot
 Slipp'd into light, and glided to the tree.
 There on the topmost bough, close-cover'd sat
 With foliage broad, eight sparrows, younglings all,
 Then newly feather'd, with their dam, the ninth.
 The little ones lamenting shrill he gorged,
 While, wheeling o'er his head, with screams the dam
 Bewail'd her darling brood. Her also next,
 Hovering and clamoring, he by the wing
 Within his spiry folds drew, and devoured.
 All eaten thus, the nestlings and the dam,
 The God who sent him, signalized him too,
 For him Saturnian Jove transform'd to stone.
 We wondering stood, to see that strange portent
 Intrude itself into our holy rites,
 When Calchas, instant, thus the sign explain'd.
 Why stand ye, Greeks, astonish'd? Ye behold
 A prodigy by Jove himself produced,
 An omen, whose accomplishment indeed
 Is distant, but whose fame shall never die.[12]
 E'en as this serpent in your sight devour'd
 Eight youngling sparrows, with their dam, the ninth,
 So we nine years must war on yonder plain,
 And in the tenth, wide-bulwark'd Troy is ours.
 So spake the seer, and as he spake, is done.
 Wait, therefore, brave Achaians! go not hence
 Till Priam's spacious city be your prize.
 He ceased, and such a shout ensued, that all
 The hollow ships the deafening roar return'd
 Of acclamation, every voice the speech
 Extolling of Ulysses, glorious Chief.
 Then Nestor the Gerenian,[13] warrior old,
 Arising, spake; and, by the Gods, he said,
 Ye more resemble children inexpert
 In war, than disciplined and prudent men.
 Where now are all your promises and vows,
 Councils, libations, right-hand covenants?[14]
 Burn them, since all our occupation here
 Is to debate and wrangle, whereof end
 Or fruit though long we wait, shall none be found.
 But, Sovereign, be not thou appall'd. Be firm.
 Relax not aught of thine accustomed sway,
 But set the battle forth as thou art wont.
 And if there be a Grecian, here and there,
 One,[15] adverse to the general voice, let such
 Wither alone. He shall not see his wish
 Gratified, neither will we hence return
 To Argos, ere events shall yet have proved
 Jove's promise false or true. For when we climb'd
 Our gallant barks full-charged with Ilium's fate,
 Saturnian Jove omnipotent, that day,
 (Omen propitious!) thunder'd on the right.
 Let no man therefore pant for home, till each
 Possess a Trojan spouse, and from her lips
 Take sweet revenge for Helen's pangs of heart.
 Who then? What soldier languishes and sighs
 To leave us? Let him dare to lay his hand
 On his own vessel, and he dies the first.
 But hear, O King! I shall suggest a course
 Not trivial. Agamemnon! sort the Greeks
 By districts and by tribes, that tribe may tribe
 Support, and each his fellow. This performed,
 And with consent of all, thou shalt discern
 With ease what Chief, what private man deserts,
 And who performs his part. The base, the brave,
 Such disposition made, shall both appear;
 And thou shalt also know, if heaven or we,
 The Gods, or our supineness, succor Troy.
 To whom Atrides, King of men, replied.
 Old Chief! Thou passest all Achaia's sons
 In consultation; would to Jove our Sire,
 To Athen�an Pallas, and Apollo!
 That I had ten such coadjutors, wise
 As thou art, and the royal city soon
 Of Priam, with her wealth, should all be ours.[16]
 But me the son of Saturn, Jove supreme
 Himself afflicts, who in contentious broils
 Involves me, and in altercation vain.
 Thence all that wordy tempest for a girl
 Achilles and myself between, and I
 The fierce aggressor. Be that breach but heal'd!
 And Troy's reprieve thenceforth is at an end.
 Go--take refreshment now that we may march
 Forth to our enemies. Let each whet well
 His spear, brace well his shield, well feed his brisk
 High-mettled horses, well survey and search
 His chariot on all sides, that no defect
 Disgrace his bright habiliments of war.
 So will we give the day from morn to eve
 To dreadful battle. Pause there shall be none
 Till night divide us. Every buckler's thong
 Shall sweat on the toil'd bosom, every hand
 That shakes the spear shall ache, and every steed
 Shall smoke that whirls the chariot o'er the plain.
 Wo then to whom I shall discover here
 Loitering among the tents; let him escape
 My vengeance if he can. The vulture's maw
 Shall have his carcase, and the dogs his bones.
 He spake; whom all applauded with a shout
 Loud as against some headland cliff the waves
 Roll'd by the stormy South o'er rocks that shoot
 Afar into the deep, which in all winds
 The flood still overspreads, blow whence they may.
 Arising, forth they rush'd, among the ships
 All scatter'd; smoke from every tent arose,
 The host their food preparing; next, his God
 Each man invoked (of the Immortals him
 Whom he preferr'd) with sacrifice and prayer
 For safe escape from danger and from death.
 But Agamemnon to Saturnian Jove
 Omnipotent, an ox of the fifth year
 Full-flesh'd devoted, and the Princes call'd
 Noblest of all the Grecians to his feast.
 First, Nestor with Idomeneus the King,
 Then either Ajax, and the son he call'd
 Of Tydeus, with Ulysses sixth and last,
 Jove's peer in wisdom. Menelaus went,
 Heroic Chief! unbidden, for he knew
 His brother's mind with weight of care oppress'd.
 The ox encircling, and their hands with meal
 Of consecration fill'd, the assembly stood,
 When Agamemnon thus his prayer preferred.
 Almighty Father! Glorious above all!
 Cloud-girt, who dwell'st in heaven thy throne sublime,
 Let not the sun go down, till Priam's roof
 Fall flat into the flames; till I shall burn
 His gates with fire; till I shall hew away
 His hack'd and riven corslet from the breast
 Of Hector, and till numerous Chiefs, his friends,
 Around him, prone in dust, shall bite the ground.
 So prayed he, but with none effect, The God
 Received his offering, but to double toil
 Doom'd them, and sorrow more than all the past.
 They then, the triturated barley grain
 First duly sprinkling, the sharp steel infix'd
 Deep in the victim's neck reversed, then stripp'd
 The carcase, and divided at their joint
 The thighs, which in the double caul involved
 They spread with slices crude, and burn'd with fire
 Ascending fierce from billets sere and dry.
 The spitted entrails next they o'er the coals
 Suspended held. The thighs with fire consumed,
 They gave to each his portion of the maw,
 Then slash'd the remnant, pierced it with the spits,
 And managing with culinary skill
 The roast, withdrew it from the spits again.
 Thus, all their task accomplished, and the board
 Set forth, they feasted, and were all sufficed.
 When neither hunger more nor thirst remain'd
 Unsatisfied, Gerenian Nestor spake.
 Atrides! Agamemnon! King of men!
 No longer waste we time in useless words,
 Nor to a distant hour postpone the work
 To which heaven calls thee. Send thine heralds forth.
 Who shall convene the Achaians at the fleet,
 That we, the Chiefs assembled here, may range,
 Together, the imbattled multitude,
 And edge their spirits for immediate fight.
 He spake, nor Agamemnon not complied.
 At once he bade his clear-voiced heralds call
 The Greeks to battle. They the summons loud
 Gave forth, and at the sound the people throng'd.
 Then Agamemnon and the Kings of Greece
 Dispatchful drew them into order just,
 With whom Minerva azure-eyed advanced,
 The inestimable �gis on her arm,
 Immortal, unobnoxious to decay
 A hundred braids, close twisted, all of gold,
 Each valued at a hundred beeves,[17] around
 Dependent fringed it. She from side to side
 Her eyes cerulean rolled, infusing thirst
 Of battle endless into every breast.
 War won them now, war sweeter now to each
 Than gales to waft them over ocean home.[18]
 As when devouring flames some forest seize
 On the high mountains, splendid from afar
 The blaze appears, so, moving on the plain,
 The steel-clad host innumerous flash'd to heaven.
 And as a multitude of fowls in flocks
 Assembled various, geese, or cranes, or swans
 Lithe-neck'd, long hovering o'er Ca�ster's banks
 On wanton plumes, successive on the mead
 Alight at last, and with a clang so loud
 That all the hollow vale of Asius rings;
 In number such from ships and tents effused,
 They cover'd the Scamandrian plain; the earth
 Rebellow'd to the feet of steeds and men.
 They overspread Scamander's grassy vale,
 Myriads, as leaves, or as the flowers of spring.
 As in the hovel where the peasant milks
 His kine in spring-time, when his pails are fill'd,
 Thick clouds of humming insects on the wing
 Swarm all around him, so the Grecians swarm'd
 An unsumm'd multitude o'er all the plain,
 Bright arm'd, high crested, and athirst for war.
 As goat-herds separate their numerous flocks
 With ease, though fed promiscuous, with like ease
 Their leaders them on every side reduced
 To martial order glorious;[19] among whom
 Stood Agamemnon "with an eye like Jove's,
 To threaten or command," like Mars in girth,
 And with the port of Neptune. As the bull
 Conspicuous among all the herd appears,
 For he surpasses all, such Jove ordain'd
 That day the son of Atreus, in the midst
 Of Heroes, eminent above them all.
 Tell me, (for ye are are heavenly, and beheld[20]
 A scene, whereof the faint report alone
 Hath reached our ears, remote and ill-informed,)
 Tell me, ye Muses, under whom, beneath
 What Chiefs of royal or of humbler note
 Stood forth the embattled Greeks? The host at large;
 They were a multitude in number more
 Than with ten tongues, and with ten mouths, each mouth
 Made vocal with a trumpet's throat of brass
 I might declare, unless the Olympian nine,
 Jove's daughters, would the chronicle themselves
 Indite, of all assembled, under Troy.
 I will rehearse the Captains and their fleets.
 [21]Boeotia's sturdy sons Peneleus led,
 And Le�tus, whose partners in command
 Arcesilaus and Prothoenor came,
 And Clonius. Them the dwellers on the rocks
 Of Aulis followed, with the hardy clans
 Of Hyrie, Schoenos, Scholos, and the hills
 Of Eteon; Thespia, Gr�a, and the plains
 Of Mycalessus them, and Harma served,
 Eleon, Erythr�, Peteon; Hyle them,
 Hesius and Ocalea, and the strength
 Of Medeon; Cop� also in their train
 Marched, with Eutresis and the mighty men
 Of Thisbe famed for doves; nor pass unnamed
 Whom Coron�a, and the grassy land
 Of Haliartus added to the war,
 Nor whom Plat�a, nor whom Glissa bred,
 And Hypotheb�,[22] and thy sacred groves
 To Neptune, dark Onchestus. Arne claims
 A record next for her illustrious sons,
 Vine-bearing Arne. Thou wast also there
 Mideia, and thou Nissa; nor be thine
 Though last, Anthedon, a forgotten name.
 These in Boeotia's fair and gallant fleet
 Of fifty ships, each bearing o'er the waves
 Thrice forty warriors, had arrived at Troy.
 In thirty ships deep-laden with the brave,
 Aspledon and Orchomenos had sent
 Their chosen youth; them ruled a noble pair,
 Sons of Astyoche; she, lovely nymph,
 Received by stealth, on Actor's stately roof,
 The embraces of a God, and bore to Mars
 Twins like himself, Ascalaphus the bold,
 And bold I�lmenus, expert in arms.
 Beneath Epistrophus and Schedius, took
 Their destined station on Boeotia's left,
 The brave Phocensians; they in forty ships
 From Cyparissus came, and from the rocks
 Of Python, and from Crissa the divine;
 From Anemoria, Daulis, Panopeus,
 And from Hyampolis, and from the banks
 Of the Cephissus, sacred stream, and from
 Lil�a, seated at its fountain-head.
 Next from beyond Euboea's happy isle
 In forty ships conveyed, stood forth well armed
 The Locrians; dwellers in Augeia some
 The pleasant, some of Opo�is possessed,
 Some of Calliarus; these Scarpha sent,
 And Cynus those; from Bessa came the rest,
 From Tarpha, Thronius, and from the brink
 Of loud Boagrius; Ajax them, the swift,
 Son of O�leus led, not such as he
 From Telamon, big-boned and lofty built,
 But small of limb, and of an humbler crest;
 Yet he, competitor had none throughout
 The Grecians of what land soe'er, for skill
 In ushering to its mark the rapid lance.
 Elphenor brought (Calchodon's mighty son)
 The Euboeans to the field. In forty ships
 From Histr��a for her vintage famed,
 From Chalcis, from Iretria, from the gates
 Of maritime Cerinthus, from the heights
 Of Dios rock-built citadel sublime,
 And from Caristus and from Styra came
 His warlike multitudes, all named alike
 Abantes, on whose shoulders fell behind
 Their locks profuse,[23] and they were eager all
 To split the hauberk with the pointed spear.
 Nor Athens had withheld her generous sons,
 The people of Erectheus. Him of old
 The teeming glebe produced, a wondrous birth!
 And Pallas rear'd him: her own unctuous fane
 She made his habitation, where with bulls
 The youth of Athens, and with slaughter'd lambs
 Her annual worship celebrate. Then led
 Menestheus, whom, (sage Nestor's self except,
 Thrice school'd in all events of human life,)
 None rivall'd ever in the just array
 Of horse and man to battle. Fifty ships
 Black-prowed, had borne them to the distant war.
 Ajax from Salamis twelve vessels brought,
 And where the Athenian band in phalanx stood
 Marshall'd compact, there station'd he his powers.
 The men of Argos and Tyrintha next,
 And of Hermione, that stands retired
 With Asine, within her spacious bay;
 Of Epidaurus, crown'd with purple vines,
 And of Troezena, with the Achaian youth
 Of sea-begirt �gina, and with thine,
 Maseta, and the dwellers on thy coast,
 Wave-worn E�on�; these all obeyed
 The dauntless Hero Diomede, whom served
 Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, a Chief
 Of deathless fame, his second in command,
 And godlike man, Euryalus, the son
 Of King Mecisteus, Tala�s' son, his third.
 But Diomede controll'd them all, and him
 Twice forty sable ships their leader own'd.
 Came Agamemnon with a hundred ships,
 Exulting in his powers; more numerous they,
 And more illustrious far than other Chief
 Could boast, whoever. Clad in burnish'd brass,
 And conscious of pre-eminence, he stood.
 He drew his host from cities far renown'd,
 Mycen�, and Corinthus, seat of wealth,
 Orneia, and Cleon� bulwark'd strong,
 And lovely Ar�thyria; Sicyon, where
 His seat of royal power held at the first
 Adrastus: Hyperesia, and the heights
 Of Gono�ssa; �gium, with the towns
 That sprinkle all that far-extended coast,
 Pellene also and wide Helice
 With all their shores, were number'd in his train.
 From hollow Laced�mon's glen profound,
 From Phare, Sparta, and from Messa, still
 Resounding with the ring-dove's amorous moan,
 From Brysia, from Augeia, from the rocks
 Of Laas, from Amycla, Otilus,
 And from the towers of Helos, at whose foot
 The surf of Ocean falls, came sixty barks
 With Menelaus. From the monarch's host
 The royal brother ranged his own apart,
 and panted for revenge of Helen's wrongs,
 And of her sighs and tears.[24] From rank to rank,
 Conscious of dauntless might he pass'd, and sent
 Into all hearts the fervor of his own.
 Gerenian Nestor in thrice thirty ships
 Had brought his warriors; they from Pylus came,
 From blithe Arene, and from Thryos, built
 Fast by the fords of Alpheus, and from steep
 And stately �py. Their confederate powers
 Sent Amphigenia, Cyparissa veiled
 With broad redundance of funereal shades,
 Pteleos and Helos, and of deathless fame
 Dorion. In Dorion erst the Muses met
 Thre�cian Thamyris, on his return
 From Eurytus, Oechalian Chief, and hush'd
 His song for ever; for he dared to vaunt
 That he would pass in song even themselves
 The Muses, daughters of Jove �gis-arm'd.
 They therefore, by his boast incensed, the bard
 Struck blind, and from his memory dash'd severe
 All traces of his once celestial strains.
 Arcadia's sons, the dwellers at the foot
 Of mount Cyllene, where �pytus sleeps
 Intomb'd; a generation bold in fight,
 And warriors hand to hand; the valiant men
 Of Pheneus, of Orchomenos by flocks
 Grazed numberless, of Ripe, Stratia, bleak
 Enispe; Mantinea city fair,
 Stymphelus and Parrhasia, and the youth
 Of Tegea; royal Agapenor these,
 Anc�us' offspring, had in sixty ships
 To Troy conducted; numerous was the crew,
 And skilled in arms, which every vessel brought,
 And Agamemnon had with barks himself
 Supplied them, for, of inland realms possessed,
 They little heeded maritime employs.[25]
 The dwellers in Buprasium, on the shores
 Of pleasant Elis, and in all the land
 Myrsinus and the Hyrminian plain between,
 The rock Olenian, and the Alysian fount;
 These all obey'd four Chiefs, and galleys ten
 Each Chief commanded, with Epeans filled.
 Amphimachus and Thalpius govern'd these,
 This, son of Cteatus, the other, sprung
 From Eurytus, and both of Actor's house.
 Diores, son of Amarynceus, those
 Led on, and, for his godlike form renown'd,
 Polyxenus was Chieftain o'er the rest,
 Son of Agasthenes, Augeias' son.
 Dulichium, and her sister sacred isles
 The Echinades, whose opposite aspect
 Looks toward Elis o'er the curling waves,
 Sent forth their powers with Meges at their head,
 Brave son of Phyleus, warrior dear to Jove.
 Phyleus in wrath, his father's house renounced,
 And to Dulichium wandering, there abode.
 Twice twenty ships had follow'd Meges forth.
 Ulysses led the Cephallenians bold.
 From Ithaca, and from the lofty woods
 Of Neritus they came, and from the rocks
 Of rude �gilipa. Crocylia these,
 And these Zacynthus own'd; nor yet a few
 From Samos, from Epirus join'd their aid,
 And from the opposite Ionian shore.
 Them, wise as Jove himself, Ulysses led
 In twelve fair ships, with crimson prows adorn'd.
 From forty ships, Thoas, Andr�mon's son,
 Had landed his �tolians; for extinct
 Was Meleager, and extinct the house
 Of Oeneus all, nor Oeneus self survived;
 To Thoas therefore had �tolia fallen;
 Him Olenos, Pylene, Chalcis served,
 With Pleuro, and the rock-bound Calydon.
 Idomeneus, spear-practised warrior, led
 The numerous Cretans. In twice forty ships
 He brought his powers to Troy. The warlike bands
 Of Cnossus, of Gortyna wall'd around,
 Of Lyctus, of Lycastus chalky-white,
 Of Ph�stus, of Miletus, with the youth
 Of Rhytius him obey'd; nor these were all,
 But others from her hundred cities Crete
 Sent forth, all whom Idomeneus the brave
 Commanded, with Meriones in arms
 Dread as the God of battles blood-imbrued.
 Nine ships Tlepolemus, Herculean-born,
 For courage famed and for superior size,
 Fill'd with his haughty Rhodians. They, in tribes
 Divided, dwelt distinct. Jelyssus these,
 Those Lindus, and the rest the shining soil
 Of white Camirus occupied. Him bore
 To Hercules, (what time he led the nymph
 From Ephyre, and from Sellea's banks,
 After full many a city laid in dust.)
 Astyocheia. In his father's house
 Magnificent, Tlepolemus spear-famed
 Had scarce up-grown to manhood's lusty prime
 When he his father's hoary uncle slew
 Lycimnius, branch of Mars. Then built he ships,
 And, pushing forth to sea, fled from the threats
 Of the whole house of Hercules. Huge toil
 And many woes he suffer'd, till at length
 At Rhodes arriving, in three separate bands
 He spread himself abroad, Much was he loved
 Of all-commanding Jove, who bless'd him there,
 And shower'd abundant riches on them all.
 Nireus of Syma, with three vessels came;
 Nireus, Agl�a's offspring, whom she bore
 To Charopus the King; Nireus in form,
 (The faultless son of Peleus sole except,)
 Loveliest of all the Grecians call'd to Troy.
 But he was heartless and his men were few.[26]
 Nisyrus, Casus, Crapathus, and Cos
 Where reign'd Eurypylus, with all the isles
 Calydn� named, under two valiant Chiefs
 Their troops disposed; Phidippus one, and one,
 His brother Antiphus, begotten both
 By Thessalus, whom Hercules begat.
 In thirty ships they sought the shores of Troy.
 The warriors of Pelasgian Argos next,
 Of Alus, and Alope, and who held
 Trechina, Phthia, and for women fair
 Distinguish'd, Hellas; known by various names
 Hellenes, Myrmidons, Ach�ans, them
 In fifty ships embark'd, Achilles ruled.
 But these were deaf to the hoarse-throated war,
 For there was none to draw their battle forth,
 And give them just array. Close in his ships
 Achilles, after loss of the bright-hair'd
 Bris�is, lay, resentful; her obtained
 Not without labor hard, and after sack
 Of Thebes and of Lyrnessus, where he slew
 Two mighty Chiefs, sons of Evenus both,
 Epistrophus and Mynes, her he mourn'd,
 And for her sake self-prison'd in his fleet
 And idle lay, though soon to rise again.
 From Phylace, and from the flowery fields
 Of Pyrrhasus, a land to Ceres given
 By consecration, and from Iton green,
 Mother of flocks; from Antron by the sea,
 And from the grassy meads of Pteleus, came
 A people, whom while yet he lived, the brave
 Protesila�s led; but him the earth
 Now cover'd dark and drear. A wife he left,
 To rend in Phylace her bleeding cheeks,
 And an unfinish'd mansion. First he died
 Of all the Greeks; for as he leap'd to land
 Foremost by far, a Dardan struck him dead.
 Nor had his troops, though filled with deep regret,
 No leader; them Podarces led, a Chief
 Like Mars in battle, brother of the slain,
 But younger born, and from Iphiclus sprung
 Who sprang from Phylacus the rich in flocks.
 But him Protesila�s, as in years,
 So also in desert of arms excell'd
 Heroic, whom his host, although they saw
 Podarces at their head, still justly mourn'd;
 For he was fierce in battle, and at Troy
 With forty sable-sided ships arrived.
 Eleven galleys, Pher� on the lake,
 And Boebe, and I�lchus, and the vale
 Of Glaphyr� supplied with crews robust
 Under Eumelus; him Alcestis, praised
 For beauty above all her sisters fair,
 In Thessaly to King Admetus bore.
 Methone, and Olizon's craggy coast,
 With Meliboea and Thaumasia sent
 Seven ships; their rowers were good archers all,
 And every vessel dipped into the wave
 Her fifty oars. Them Philoctetes, skill'd
 To draw with sinewy arm the stubborn bow,
 Commanded; but he suffering anguish keen
 Inflicted by a serpent's venom'd tooth,
 Lay sick in Lemnos; him the Grecians there
 Had left sore-wounded, but were destined soon
 To call to dear remembrance whom they left.
 Meantime, though sorrowing for his sake, his troops
 Yet wanted not a chief; them Medon ruled,
 Whom Rhena to the far-famed conqueror bore
 O�leus, fruit of their unsanction'd loves.
 From Tricca, from Ithome rough and rude
 With rocks and glens, and from Oechalia, town
 Of Eurytus Oechalian-born, came forth
 Their warlike youth by Podalirius led
 And by Machaon, healers both expert
 Of all disease, and thirty ships were theirs.
 The men of Ormenus, and from beside
 The fountain Hypereia, from the tops
 Of chalky Titan, and Asteria's band;
 Them ruled Eurypylus, Ev�mon's son
 Illustrious, whom twice twenty ships obeyed.
 Orthe, Gyrtone, Olo�sson white,
 Argissa and Helone; they their youth
 Gave to control of Polypoetes, son
 Undaunted of Piritho�s, son of Jove.
 Him, to Piritho�s, (on the self-same day
 When he the Centaurs punish'd and pursued
 Sheer to �thic� driven from Pelion's heights
 The shaggy race) Hippodamia bore.
 Nor he alone them led. With him was join'd
 Leonteus dauntless warrior, from the bold
 Coronus sprung, who C�neus call'd his sire.
 Twice twenty ships awaited their command.
 Guneus from Cyphus twenty and two ships
 Led forth; the Enienes him obey'd,
 And the robust Peroebi, warriors bold,
 And dwellers on Dodona's wintry brow.
 To these were join'd who till the pleasant fields
 Where Titaresius winds; the gentle flood
 Pours into Peneus all his limpid stores,
 But with the silver-eddied Peneus flows
 Unmixt as oil;[27] for Stygian is his stream,
 And Styx is the inviolable oath.
 Last with his forty ships, Tenthredon's son,
 The active Protho�s came. From the green banks
 Of Peneus his Magnesians far and near
 He gather'd, and from Pelion forest-crown'd.
 These were the princes and the Chiefs of Greece.
 Say, Muse, who most in personal desert
 Excell'd, and whose were the most warlike steeds
 And of the noblest strain. Their hue, their age,
 Their height the same, swift as the winds of heaven
 And passing far all others, were the mares
 Which drew Eumelus; on Pierian hills
 The heavenly Archer of the silver bow,
 Apollo, bred them. But of men, the chief
 Was Telamonian Ajax, while wrath-bound
 Achilles lay; for he was worthier far,
 And more illustrious were the steeds which bore
 The noble son of Peleus; but revenge
 On Agamemnon leader of the host
 Was all his thought, while in his gallant ships
 Sharp-keel'd to cut the foaming flood, he lay.
 Meantime, along the margin of the deep
 His soldiers hurled the disk, or bent the bow.
 Or to its mark dispatch'd the quivering lance.
 Beside the chariots stood the unharness'd steeds
 Cropping the lotus, or at leisure browsed
 On celery wild, from watery freshes gleaned.
 Beneath the shadow of the sheltering tent
 The chariot stood, while they, the charioteers
 Roam'd here and there the camp, their warlike lord
 Regretting sad, and idle for his sake.
 As if a fire had burnt along the ground,
 Such seem'd their march; earth groan'd their steps beneath;
 As when in Arimi, where fame reports
 Typho�us stretch'd, the fires of angry Jove
 Down darted, lash the ground, so groan'd the earth
 Beneath them, for they traversed swift the plain.
 And now from Jove, with heavy tidings charged,
 Wind-footed Iris to the Trojans came.
 It was the time of council, when the throng
 At Priam's gate assembled, young and old:
 Them, standing nigh, the messenger of heaven
 Accosted with the voice of Priam's son,
 Polites. He, confiding in his speed
 For sure deliverance, posted was abroad
 On �syeta's tomb,[28] intent to watch
 When the Achaian host should leave the fleet.
 The Goddess in his form thus them address'd.
 Oh, ancient Monarch! Ever, evermore
 Speaking, debating, as if all were peace;
 I have seen many a bright-embattled field,
 But never one so throng'd as this to-day.
 For like the leaves, or like the sands they come
 Swept by the winds, to gird the city round.
 But Hector! chiefly thee I shall exhort.
 In Priam's spacious city are allies
 Collected numerous, and of nations wide
 Disseminated various are the tongues.
 Let every Chief his proper troop command,
 And marshal his own citizens to war.
 She ceased; her Hector heard intelligent,
 And quick dissolved the council. All took arms.
 Wide flew the gates; forth rush'd the multitude,
 Horsemen and foot, and boisterous stir arose.
 In front of Ilium, distant on the plain,
 Clear all around from all obstruction, stands
 An eminence high-raised, by mortal men
 Call'd Bateia, but the Gods the tomb
 Have named it of Myrinna swift in fight.
 Troy and her aids there set the battle forth.
 Huge Priameian Hector, fierce in arms,
 Led on the Trojans; with whom march'd the most
 And the most valiant, dexterous at the spear.
 �neas, (on the hills of Ida him
 The lovely Venus to Anchises bore,
 A Goddess by a mortal man embraced)
 Led the Dardanians; but not he alone;
 Archilochus with him and Acamas
 Stood forth, the offspring of Antenor, each,
 And well instructed in all forms of war.
 Fast by the foot of Ida, where they drank
 The limpid waters of �sepus, dwelt
 The Trojans of Zeleia. Rich were they
 And led by Pandarus, Lycaon's son,
 Whom Phoebus self graced with the bow he bore.
 Ap�sus, Adrastea, Terie steep,
 And Pitueia--them, Amphius clad
 In mail thick-woven, and Adrastus, ruled.
 They were the sons of the Percosian seer
 Merops, expert in the soothsayers' art
 Above all other; he his sons forbad
 The bloody fight, but disobedient they
 Still sought it, for their destiny prevailed.
 The warriors of Percote, and who dwelt
 In Practius, in Arisba, city fair,
 In Sestus, in Abydus, march'd behind
 Princely Hyrtacides; his tawny steeds,
 Strong-built and tall, from Sellcentes' bank
 And from Arisba, had him borne to Troy.
 Hippothous and Pilmus, branch of Mars,
 Both sons of Lethus the Pelasgian, they,
 Forth from Larissa for her fertile soil
 Far-famed, the spear-expert Pelasgians brought.
 The Thracians (all whom Hellespont includes
 Within the banks of his swift-racing tide)
 Heroic Acamas and Pirous led.
 Euphemus, offspring of Troezenus, son
 Of Jove-protected Ceas, was the Chief
 Whom the spear-arm'd Ciconian band obey'd.
 P�onia's archers follow'd to the field
 Pyr�chmes; they from Amydon remote
 Were drawn, where Axius winds; broad Axius, stream
 Diffused delightful over all the vale.
 Pyl�menes, a Chief of giant might
 From the Eneti for forest-mules renowned
 March'd with his Paphlagonians; dwellers they
 In Sesamus and in Cytorus were,
 And by the stream Parthenius; Cromna these
 Sent forth, and those �gialus on the lip
 And margin of the land, and some, the heights
 Of Erythini, rugged and abrupt.
 Epistrophus and Odius from the land
 Of Alybe, a region far remote,
 Where veins of silver wind, led to the field
 The Halizonians. With the Mysians came
 Chromis their Chief, and Ennomus; him skill'd
 In augury, but skill'd in vain, his art
 Saved not, but by �acides[29] the swift,
 With others in the Xanthus[30] slain, he died.
 Ascanius, lovely youth, and Phorcis, led
 The Phrygians from Ascania far remote,
 Ardent for battle. The Moeonian race,
 (All those who at the foot of Tmolus dwelt,)
 Mesthles and Antiphus, fraternal pair,
 Sons of Pyl�menes commanded, both
 Of the Gyg�an lake in Lydia born.
 Amphimachus and Nastes led to fight
 The Carians, people of a barbarous speech,[31]
 With the Milesians, and the mountain-race
 Of wood-crown'd Phthira, and who dwelt beside
 M�ander, or on Mycale sublime.
 Them led Amphimachus and Nastes, sons
 Renown'd of Nomion. Like a simple girl
 Came forth Amphimachus with gold bedight,
 But him his trappings from a woful death
 Saved not, when whirled beneath the bloody tide
 To Peleus' stormy son his spoils he left.
 Sarpedon with the noble Glaucus led
 Their warriors forth from farthest Lycia, where
 Xanthus deep-dimpled rolls his oozy tide.
