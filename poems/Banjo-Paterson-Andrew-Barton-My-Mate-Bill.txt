That�s his saddle on the tie-beam,
And them�s his spurs up there
On the wall-plate over yonder�
You ken see they ain�t a pair.

For the daddy of all the stockmen
As ever come mustering here
Was killed in the flaming mulga,
A-yarding a bald-faced steer.

They say as he�s gone to heaven,
And shook off all worldly cares
But I can�t sight Bill in a halo
Set up on three blinded hairs.

In heaven! what next I wonder,
For strike me pink and blue,
If I see whatever in thunder
They�ll find for Bill to do.

He�d never make one of them angels,
With faces as white as chalk,
All wool to the toes like hoggets,
And wings like an eagle-hawk.

He couldn�t �arp for apples,
His voice had tones as jarred,
And he�d no more ear than a bald-faced steer,
Or calves in a branding yard.

He could sit on a bucking brumbie
Like a nob in an easy chair,
And chop his name with a greenhide fall
On the flank of a flying steer.

He could show them saints in glory
The way that a fall should drop,
But sit on a throne�not William,
Unless they could make it prop.

He mightn�t freeze to the seraphs,
Or chum with the cherubim,
But if ever them seraph johnnies
Get a-poking it like at him�

Well! if there�s hide in heaven,
And silk for to make a lash,
He�ll yard �em all in the Jasper Lake
In a blinded lightning flash.

If the heavenly hosts get boxed now,
As mobs most always will,
Who�ll cut �em out like William,
Or draft on a camp like Bill?

An �orseman would find it awkward
At first with a push that flew,
But blame my cats if I know what else
They�ll find for Bill to do.

It�s hard if there ain�t no cattle,
And perhaps they�ll let him sleep,
And wake him up at the judgment
To draft those goats and sheep.

It�s playing it low on William,
But perhaps he�ll buckle to,
To show them high-toned seraphs
What a Mulga man can do.

If they saddles a big-boned angel,
With a turn of speed, of course,
As can spiel like a four-year brumbie,
And prop like an old camp horse,

And puts Bill up with a snaffle,
A four or five inch spur,
And eighteen foot of greenhide
To chop the blinded fur�

He�ll yard them blamed Angoras
In a way that it�s safe to swear
Will make them tony seraphs
Sit back on their thrones and stare.
