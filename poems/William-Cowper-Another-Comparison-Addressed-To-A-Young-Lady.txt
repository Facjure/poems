Sweet stream that winds through yonder glade,
Apt emblem of a virtuous maid�
Silent and chaste she steals along,
Far from the world�s gay busy throng;
With gentle yet prevailing force,
Intent upon her destined course;
Graceful and useful all she does,
Blessing and blest where�er she goes.
Pure-bosom�d as that watery glass,
And heaven reflected in her face.
