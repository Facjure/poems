Now, brothers, sing out our song,
Whose train of light shall follow long!
 With love are its measures beating
 And victory's joyous greeting,
While round about it flower-seeds
In will of youth shall grow to deeds!

Our song has gone far and. wide,
Bright mem'ries on our way abide,
 In flags flying, friends that love us,
 In wreaths from fair hands above us,
In feasts where youth's full spirits stream,
Our nation's past, our nation's dream.

At Hald on a sunny day
That shot-torn flag of many a fray
 Was waving above our singing,
 Soul-fire to our music bringing,
The ardor of that glorious band,
Who died as heroes for our land.

To Arendal our summer-way
"For might and fame!" - remember aye!
 The fleet on the bay was riding,
 Our singer-ship through it gliding.
Our merchant-ships shall rule the wave!
This joyous hoisting-song we gave.

We gathered in Bergen town
Of ancient and of new renown.
 The horns of our fathers greet us,
 King Sverre comes forth to meet us;
But fresh and full the present spoke
In heartfelt song from all its folk.

Upsala, Copenhagen, Lund,
In each our song its garland won,
 Fair fetters of music winding,
 Harmonious the Northland binding;
Our mighty choral theme shall be
The Northern races' unity.

With courage, then, onward roam!
Where echo answers is our home.
 Our past that we sing draws nearer,
 Our future in song grows clearer,
E'en while we wander hand in hand
And summer sing into our land.
