title: The Geate A-vallen To
---

In the zunsheen of our zummers
Wi� the hay time now a-come,
How busy wer we out a-vield
Wi� vew a-left at hwome,
When waggons rumbled out ov yard
Red wheeled, wi� body blue,
And back behind �em loudly slamm�d
The geate a�vallen to.

Drough daysheen ov how many years
The geate ha� now a-swung
Behind the veet o� vull-grown men
And vootsteps of the young.
Drough years o� days it swung to us
Behind each little shoe,
As we tripped lightly on avore
The geate a-vallen to.

In evenen time o� starry night
How mother zot at hwome,
And kept her bleazen vier bright
Till father should ha? come,
An� how she quicken�d up and smiled
An� stirred her vier anew,
To hear the trampen ho�ses� steps
An� geate a-vallen to.

There?s moon-sheen now in nights o� fall
When leaves be brown vrom green,
When, to the slammen o� the geate,
Our Jenny�s ears be keen,
When the wold dog do wag his tail,
An� Jean could tell to who,
As he do come in drough the geate,
The geate a-vallen to.

An� oft do come a saddened hour
When there must goo away
One well-beloved to our heart�s core,
Vor long, perhaps vor aye:
An� oh! it is a touchen thing
The loven heart must rue,
To hear behind his last farewell
The geate a-vallen to.
