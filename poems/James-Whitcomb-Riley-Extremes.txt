I

 A little boy once played so loud
 That the Thunder, up in a thunder-cloud,
 Said, "Since I can't be heard, why, then
 I'll never, never thunder again!"




II

 And a little girl once kept so still
 That she heard a fly on the window-sill
 Whisper and say to a lady-bird, - 
 "She's the stilliest child I ever heard!"
