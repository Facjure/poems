---

 Take, cradled Nursling of the mountain, take
 This parting glance, no negligent adieu!
 A Protean change seems wrought while I pursue
 The curves, a loosely-scattered chain doth make;
 Or rather thou appear'st a glistering snake,
 Silent, and to the gazer's eye untrue,
 Thridding with sinuous lapse the rushes, through
 Dwarf willows gliding, and by ferny brake.
 Starts from a dizzy steep the undaunted Rill
 Robed instantly in garb of snow-white foam;
 And laughing dares the Adventurer, who hath clomb
 So high, a rival purpose to fulfill;
 Else let the dastard backward wend, and roam,
 Seeking less bold achievement, where he will!
