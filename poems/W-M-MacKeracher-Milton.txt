Say not that England ever kingless was:
 'Twixt Charles and Charles two royal men appear, -
Cromwell, to give her health with arms and laws,
 And Milton, thou, to speak out loud and clear
For freedom of man's conscience and the state,
 For England and her deeds before the world,
And for the victims of religious hate
 From Alpine summits pitilessly hurl'd.

Thou wast a Champion of Liberty:
 In fair Italian cities thou had'st heard
Her voice upon the north wind summon thee,
 And, like another Moses, had'st preferr'd
Affliction with thy brethren to the lure
Of beauty, art and cultur'd ease secure.
