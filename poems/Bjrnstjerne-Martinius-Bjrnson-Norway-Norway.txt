(See Note 76)

 Norway, Norway,
Rising in blue from the sea's gray and green,
Islands around like fledglings tender,
Fjord-tongues with slender,
Tapering tips in the silence seen.
 Rivers, valleys,
Mate among mountains, wood-ridge and slope
Wandering follow. Where the wastes lighten,
Lake and plain brighten
Hallow a temple of peace and hope.
 Norway, Norway,
Houses and huts, not castles grand,
 Gentle or hard,
 Thee we guard, thee we guard,
Thee, our future's fair land.

 Norway, Norway,
Glistening heights where skis swiftly go,
Harbors with fishermen, salts, and craftsmen,
Rivers and raftsmen,
Herdsmen and horns and the glacier-glow.
 Moors and meadows,
Runes in the woodlands, and wide-mown swaths,
Cities like flowers, streams that run dashing
Out to the flashing
White of the sea, where the fish-school froths.
 Norway, Norway,
Houses and huts, not castles grand,
 Gentle or hard,
 Thee we guard, thee we guard,
Thee, our future's fair land.
