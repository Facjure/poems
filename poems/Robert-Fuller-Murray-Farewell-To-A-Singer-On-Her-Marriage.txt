title: Farewell To A Singer. On Her Marriage
---

As those who hear a sweet bird sing,
 And love each song it sings the best,
Grieve when they see it taking wing
 And flying to another nest:

We, who have heard your voice so oft,
 And loved it more than we can tell,
Our hearts grow sad, our voices soft,
 Our eyes grow dim, to say farewell.

It is not kind to leave us thus;
 Yet we forgive you and combine,
Although you now bring grief to us,
 To wish you joy, for auld lang syne.
