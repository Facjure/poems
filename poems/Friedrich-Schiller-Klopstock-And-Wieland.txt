(WHEN THEIR MINIATURES WERE HANGING SIDE BY SIDE.)

In truth, when I have crossed dark Lethe's river,
The man upon the right I'll love forever,
 For 'twas he first that wrote for me.
For all the world the left man wrote, full clearly,
And so we all should love him dearly;
 Come, left man! I must needs kiss thee!
