title: Look From Thy Lattice, Love.
---

Look from thy lattice, love--
Listen to me!
The cool, balmy breeze
Is abroad on the sea!
The moon, like a queen,
Roams her realms above,
And naught is awake
But the spirit of love.
Ere morn's golden light
Tips the hills with its ray,
Away o'er the waters--
Away and away!
Then look from thy lattice, love--
Listen to me.
While the moon lights the sky,
And the breeze curls the sea!
Look from thy lattice, love--
Listen to me!
In the voyage of life,
Love our pilot will be!
He'll sit at the helm
Wherever we rove,
And steer by the load-star
He kindled above!
His gem-girdled shallop
Will cut the bright spray,
Or skim, like a bird,
O'er the waters away!
Then look from thy lattice, love--
Listen to me,
While the moon lights the sky,
And the breeze curls the sea!
