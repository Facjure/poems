 Before I drink myself to death,
 God, let me finish up my Book!
 At night, I fear, I fight for breath,
 And wake up whiter than a spook;
 And crawl off to a bistro near,
 And drink until my brain is clear.

 Rare Absinthe! Oh, it gives me strength
 To write and write; and so I spend
 Day after day, until at length
 With joy and pain I'll write The End:
 Then let this carcase rot; I give
 The world my Book - my Book will live.

 For every line is tense with truth,
 There's hope and joy on every page;
 A cheer, a clarion call to Youth,
 A hymn, a comforter to Age:
 All's there that I was meant to be,
 My part divine, the God in me.

 It's of my life the golden sum;
 Ah! who that reads this Book of mine,
 In stormy centuries to come,
 Will dream I rooted with the swine?
 Behold! I give mankind my best:
 What does it matter, all the rest?

 It's this that makes sublime my day;
 It's this that makes me struggle on.
 Oh, let them mock my mortal clay,
 My spirit's deathless as the dawn;
 Oh, let them shudder as they look . . .
 I'll be immortal in my Book.

 And so beside the sullen Seine
 I fight with dogs for filthy food,
 Yet know that from my sin and pain
 Will soar serene a Something Good;
 Exultantly from shame and wrong
 A Right, a Glory and a Song.
