Rejoice, O Canada, rejoice,
On this thy natal day;
In East and West lift up thy voice,
And to thy children say:
"Behold me now to stature sprung;
Acclaim my second birth;
A Nation now I stand among
My sisters of the earth."

The wrath of man doth praise the Lord;
And, glorious be His name,
An Empire, fashioned by the sword
And welded in the flame,
Hath risen o'er the battle-smoke,
And near and far unfurled
Its righteous standard to evoke
Heaven's blessings on the world.
