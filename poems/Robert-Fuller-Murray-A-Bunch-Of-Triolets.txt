TO ---

You like the trifling triolet:
 Well, here are three or four.
Unless your likings I forget,
You like the trifling triolet.
Against my conscience I abet
 A taste which I deplore;
You like the trifling triolet:
 Well, here are three or four.

 Have you ever met with a pretty girl
 Walking along the street,
With a nice new dress and her hair in curl?
Have you ever met with a pretty girl,
When her hat blew off and the wind with a whirl
 Wafted it right to your feet?
Have you ever met with a pretty girl
 Walking along the street?

I ran into a lady's arms,
 Turning a corner yesterday.
To my confusion, her alarms,
I ran into a lady's arms.
So close a vision of her charms
 Left me without a word to say.
I ran into a lady's arms,
 Turning a corner yesterday.

 How many maids you love,
 How many maids love you!
Your conscious blushes prove
How many maids you love.
Each trusts you like a dove,
 But would she, if she knew
How many maids you love,
 How many maids love you?
