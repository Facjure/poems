The primrwose in the shade do blow,
The cowslip in the zun,
The thyme upon the down do grow,
The clote where streams do run;
An� where do pretty maidens grow
An� blow, but where the tow�r
Do rise among the bricken tuns,
In Blackmwore by the Stour.

If you could zee their comely gait,
An� pretty faces� smiles,
A-trippen on so light o� waight,
An� steppen off the stiles;
A-gwain to church, as bells do swing
An� ring �ithin the tow�r,
You�d own the pretty maidens� place
Is Blackmwore by the Stour.

If you vrom Wimborne took your road,
To Stower or Paladore,
An� all the farmers� housen show�d
Their daughters at the door;
You�d cry to bachelors at hwome 
�Here, come: �ithin an hour
You �ll vind ten maidens to your mind,
In Blackmwore by the Stour.�

An� if you look�d �ithin their door,
To zee em in their place,
A-doen housework up avore
Their smilen mother�s face;
You�d cry �Why, if a man would wive
An� thrive, �ithout a dow�r,
Then let en look en out a wife
In Blackmwore by the Stour.�

As I upon my road did pass
A school-house back in May,
There out upon the beten grass
Wer madens at their play
An� as the pretty souls did tweil
An� smile, I cried, �The flow�r
O� beauty, then, is still in bud
In Blackmore by the Stour.�
