Had fallen a fragrant shower;
 The leaves were dripping yet;
Each fern and rain-weighed flower
 Around were gleaming wet;
On ev'ry bosky bower
 A million gems were set.

The dust's moist odors sifted
 Cool with the summer rain,
Mixed with the musk that drifted
 From orchard and from plain; - 
Her garden's fence white lifted
 Its length along the lane.

The moon the clouds had shattered
 In curdled peaks of pearl;
The honeysuckle scattered
 Warm odors from each curl,
Where the white moonlight, flattered,
 Hung molten 'round a girl.

Then grew the night completer
 With light and cloud and air;
Aromas sweet blew sweeter,
 Sweet flowers fair, more fair;
Fleet feet and fast grew fleeter
 Thro' that fair sorceress there.
