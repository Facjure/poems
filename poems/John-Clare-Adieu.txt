title: Adieu!

 "Adieu, my love, adieu!
 Be constant and be true
 As the daisies gemmed with dew,
 Bonny maid."
 The cows their thirst were slaking,
 Trees the playful winds were shaking;
 Sweet songs the birds were making
 In the shade.

 The moss upon the tree
 Was as green as green could be,
 The clover on the lea
 Ruddy glowed;
 Leaves were silver with the dew,
 Where the tall sowthistles grew,
 And I bade the maid adieu
 On the road.

 Then I took myself to sea,
 While the little chiming bee
 Sung his ballad on the lea,
 Humming sweet;
 And the red-winged butterfly
 Was sailing through the sky,
 Skimming up and bouncing by
 Near my feet.

 I left the little birds,
 And sweet lowing of the herds,
 And couldn't find out words,
 Do you see,
 To say to them good bye,
 Where the yellow cups do lie;
 So heaving a deep sigh,
 Took to sea.
