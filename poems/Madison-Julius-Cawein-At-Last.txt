What shall be said to him,
 Now he is dead?
Now that his eyes are dim,
 Low lies his head?
What shall be said to him,
 Now he is dead?

One word to whisper of
 Low in his ear;
Sweet, but the one word "love"
 Haply he'll hear.
One word to whisper of
 Low in his ear.

What shall be given him,
 Now he is dead?
Now that his eyes are dim,
 Low lies his head?
What shall be given him,
 Now he is dead?

Hope, that life long denied
 Here to his heart,
Sweet, lay it now beside,
 Never to part.
Hope, that life long denied
 Here to his heart.
