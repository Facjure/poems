 (April, 1865.)


 As billows upon billows roll,
 On victory victory breaks;
 Ere yet seven days from Richmond's fall
 And crowning triumph wakes
 The loud joy-gun, whose thunders run
 By sea-shore, streams, and lakes.
 The hope and great event agree
 In the sword that Grant received from Lee.

 The warring eagles fold the wing,
 But not in Cï¿½sar's sway;
 Not Rome o'ercome by Roman arms we sing,
 As on Pharsalia's day,
 But Treason thrown, though a giant grown,
 And Freedom's larger play.
 All human tribes glad token see
 In the close of the wars of Grant and Lee.
