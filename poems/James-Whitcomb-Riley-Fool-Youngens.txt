 Me an' Bert an' Minnie-Belle
 Knows a joke, an' we won't tell!
 No, we don't - 'cause we don't know
 Why we got to laughin' so;
 But we got to laughin' so,
 "We ist kep' a-laughin'.

 Wind wuz blowin' in the tree - 
 An' wuz only ist us three
 Playin' there; an' ever' one
 Ketched each other, like we done,
 Squintin' up there at the sun
 Like we wuz a-laughin'.

 Nothin' funny anyway;
 But I laughed, an' so did they - 
 An' we all three laughed, an' nen
 Squint' our eyes an' laugh' again:
 Ner we didn't ist p'ten' - 
 We wuz shore-'nough laughin'.


 "We ist laugh' an' laugh', tel Bert
 Say he can't quit an' it hurt.
 Nen I howl, an' Minnie-Belle
 She tear up the grass a spell
 An' ist stop her yeers an' yell
 Like she'd die a-laughin'.

 Never sich fool-youngens yit!
 Nothin' funny, - not a bit! - 
 But we laugh' so; tel we whoop'
 Purt'-nigh like we have the croup - 
 All so hoarse we'd wheeze an' whoop
 An' ist choke a-laughin'.
