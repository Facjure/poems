It was old Jerry Brown,
Who�d an office in town,
And he used to get jocular, very;
And he�d go to the Shore
When they�d serve him no more,
And, of course, by the passenger ferry,
A sight on the passenger ferry.

Now this is a song of the ferry,
And a lay of the juice of the berry;
�Tis the ballad of Brown,
Who�d a business in town,
And commenced to go down
Very slow,
Don�t you know?
By coming home just a bit merry.

By the Drunks� Boat, that�s right,
On a Saturday night
He would often be past being merry;
With his back teeth afloat,
On the twelve o�clock boat,
And a spectacle there on the ferry
(A picture to all on the ferry).

In the mornings, ashamed,
�Twas the last drink he blamed,
Though the first was the matter with Jerry,
With his nerve out of joint,
He�d sneak down to Blue�s Point,
And he�d cross by the horse-and-cart ferry,
Like a thief, by the horse-and-cart ferry.

But long before night
He�d most likely be tight,
And a subject and theme for George Perry;
And he�d cross to the Shore,
Somewhat worse than before,
And a nuisance to all on the ferry;
Singing-drunk on the passenger ferry.

And so it went on
Till his reason seemed gone,
And the Law, so it seemed, got a derry
On Brown. He went down,
And they sent him to town
One day, by �the trap,� on the ferry,
The Government trap on the ferry.

He was sober and sane
When he came back again,
And the past he�d determined to bury,
Or, I mean, live it down,
And he crossed from the town
Like a man, on the passenger ferry.
(There were sceptical souls on that ferry.)

They say �twas the jaw
Of his mother-in-law
Drove him back to the juice of the berry;
But he soon got afloat
On the passenger boat
Or adrift on the horse-and-cart ferry
(Wrongly called the ve-hic-ular ferry).

The drink had him fast,
And he drank till at last
He dried up, a withered old cherry;
And they thought him no loss
When they sent him across
In a box, on the cart-and-horse ferry,
In a low, covered trap on the ferry.

Which I rise to explain,
If the moral ain�t plain,
And if you�re a cove that gets merry,
Always stick, when �afloat,�
To the passenger boat;
Or else to the cart-and-horse ferry,
Or you�ll make matters worse, like old Jerry.

But this is the song of the ferry,
And the lay of the juice of the berry;
And you will not deny,
If you read by-and-bye,
That the casual eye
Of the Tight
At first sight
Misses much in the song of the ferry.
