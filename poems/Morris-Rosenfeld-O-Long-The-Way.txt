title: O Long The Way

O long the way and short the day,
No light in tower or town,
The waters roar and far the shore--
My ship, my ship goes down!

'Tis all in vain to strive again,
My cry the billows drown,
The fight is done, the wind has won--
My ship, my ship goes down!

Bright sun, adieu! Thou'lt shine anew
When skies no longer frown,
But I--the deafening billows crash--
My ship, my ship goes down!
