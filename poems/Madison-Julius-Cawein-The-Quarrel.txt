 Could I divine how her gray eyes
 Gat such cold haughtiness of skies;

 How, some wood-flower's shadow brown,
 Dimmed her fair forehead's wrath a frown;

 How, rippled sunshine blown thro' air,
 Tossed scorn her eloquence of hair;

 How to a folded bud again
 She drew her blossomed lips' disdain;

 Naught deigning save eyes' utterance,
 Star-words, which quicker reach the sense;

 Then, afterwards, how melted there
 The austere woman to one tear;

 Then were I wise to know how grew
 This star-stained miracle of blue,
 How God makes wild flowers out of dew.
