 It's Oh, for the hills, where the wind's some one
 With a vagabond foot that follows!
 And a cheer-up hand that he claps upon
 Your arm with the hearty words, "Come on!
 We'll soon be out of the hollows,
 My heart!
 We'll soon be out of the hollows!"

 It's Oh, for the songs, where the hope's some one
 With a renegade foot that doubles!
 And a kindly look that he turns upon
 Your face with the friendly laugh, "Come on!
 We'll soon be out of the troubles,
 My heart!
 We'll soon be out of the troubles!"
