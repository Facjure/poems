Two o�clock, the morning of October 12th, 1915.

 To her accustomed eyes
 The midnight-morning brought not such a dread
 As thrills the chance-awakened head that lies
 In trivial sleep on the habitual bed.

 �Twas yet some hours ere light;
 And many, many, many a break of day
 Had she outwatched the dying; but this night
 Shortened her vigil was, briefer the way.

 By dial of the clock
 �Twas day in the dark above her lonely head.
 "This day thou shalt be with Me."Ere the cock
 Announced that day she met the Immortal Dead.
