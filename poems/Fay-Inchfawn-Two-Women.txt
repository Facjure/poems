"I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord" -- Phil. iv. 2,

EUODIAS.

But if Paul heard her tattlings, I am sure
He never would expect me to endure.
There is a something in her very face
Antagonistic to the work of grace.
And even when I would speak graciously
Somehow, Syntyche's manner ruffles me.

SYNTYCHE.

No, not for worlds! Euodias has no mind;
So slow she is, so spiritually blind.
Her tongue is quite unbridled, yet she says
She grieves to see my aggravating ways
Ah, no one but myself knows perfectly
How odious Euodias can be!

EUODIAS.

Yet, "in the Lord." Ah, that's another thing!

SYNTYCHE.

Yet, "in the Lord." That alters it in- deed.

EUODIAS.

For His sake I'll endure her whispering

SYNTYCHE.

For His sake I'll consent to let her lead.

EUODIAS.

Lord, teach me to forbear; yes, day by day.

SYNTYCHE.

Lord, keep me gentle now, and all the way.
