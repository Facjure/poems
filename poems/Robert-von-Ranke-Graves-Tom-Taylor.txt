 On pay-day nights, neck-full with beer,
 Old soldiers stumbling homeward here,
 Homeward (still dazzled by the spark
 Love kindled in some alley dark)
 Young soldiers mooning in slow thought,
 Start suddenly, turn about, are caught
 By a dancing sound, merry as a grig,
 Tom Taylor's piccolo playing jig.
 Never was blown from human cheeks
 Music like this, that calls and speaks
 Till sots and lovers from one string
 Dangle and dance in the same ring.
 Tom, of your piping I've heard said
 And seen, that you can rouse the dead,
 Dead-drunken men awash who lie
 In stinking gutters hear your cry,
 I've seen them twitch, draw breath, grope, sigh,
 Heave up, sway, stand; grotesquely then
 You set them dancing, these dead men.
 They stamp and prance with sobbing breath,
 Victims of wine or love or death,
 In ragged time they jump, they shake
 Their heads, sweating to overtake
 The impetuous tune flying ahead.
 They flounder after, with legs of lead.
 Now, suddenly as it started, play
 Stops, the short echo dies away,
 The corpses drop, a senseless heap,
 The drunk men gaze about like sheep.
 Grinning, the lovers sigh and stare
 Up at the broad moon hanging there,
 While Tom, five fingers to his nose,
 Skips off...And the last bugle blows.
