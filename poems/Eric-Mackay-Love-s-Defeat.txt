title: Love's Defeat.

Do what I will, I cannot chant so well
 As other men; and yet my soul is true.
My hopes are bold; my thoughts are hard to tell,
 But thou can'st read them, and accept them, too,
 Though, half-abash'd, they seem to hide from view.
I strike the lyre, I sound the hollow shell;
And why? For comfort, when my thoughts rebel,
 And when I count the woes that must ensue.
But for this reason, and no other one,
 I dare to look thy way, and bow my head
To thy sweet name, as sunflower to the sun,
 Though, peradventure, not so wisely fed
 With garden fancies. Tears must now be shed,
Unnumber'd tears, till life or love be done!
