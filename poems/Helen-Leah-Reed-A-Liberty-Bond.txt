A liberty bond! What a queer contradiction!
Although truth, as you've heard, may be stranger than fiction.
For Liberty should from all fetters release us,
While bonds hold one fast, whether pauper or Croesus.
Yet a Liberty Bond - I'd advise you to buy it - 
Will ensure you your freedom - you'll see when you try it.
'Twill aid you to conquer foes cruel, despotic,
'Twill help save your Country, come, be patriotic!
A Liberty Bond - I'd advise you to buy one - 
Will ensure you your freedom - rejoice when you try one!
