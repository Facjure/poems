---

She is glad to receive your turquoise ring,
 Dear and dark-eyed Lover of mine!
I, to have given you everything:
 Beauty maddens the soul like Wine.

"She is proud to have held aloof her charms,
 Slender, dark-eyed Lover of mine!
But I, of the night you lay in my arms:
 Beauty maddens the sense like Wine!

"She triumphs to think that your heart is won,
 Stately, dark-eyed Lover of mine!
I had not a thought of myself, not one:
 Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!

"She will speak you softly, while skies are blue,
 Dear, deluded Lover of mine!
I would lose both body and soul for you:
 Beauty maddens the brain like Wine!

"While the ways are fair she will love you well,
 Dear, disdainful Lover of mine!
But I would have followed you down to Hell:
 Beauty maddens the soul like Wine!

"Though you lay at her feet the days to be,
 Now no longer Lover of mine!
You can give her naught that you gave not me:
 Beauty maddened my soul like Wine!

"When the years have shown what is false or true:
 Beauty maddens the sight like Wine!
You will understand how I cared for you,
 First and only Lover of mine!"
