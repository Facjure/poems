Only a Dream!
 It floated thro'
 The sky of a lonely sleep
As floats a gleam
Athwart the Blue
 Of a golden clouded Deep.

Only a Dream!
I calmly slept.
Meseems I called a name;
 I woke; and, waking, I think I wept
And called -- and called the same.

Only a Dream!
Graves have no ears;
They give not back the dead;
 They will not listen to the saddest tears
That ever may be shed.

Only a Dream!
Graves keep their own;
They have no hearts to hear;
 But the loved will come
 From their Heaven-Home
To smile on the sleeper's tear.
