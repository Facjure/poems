---

Yumping over crossings,
 Bumping over svitches,
Till ay tenk dis enyine
 Going to fall in ditches;
Hiding vith some cattle,
 Ay tenk 'bout saxty-eight;
Yiminy! Dis ban yolly, - 
 Stealing ride on freight

Ay ban yust tru treshing
 Op in Nort Dakota;
Now ay guess ay'm going
 Back to old Mansota.
Now dis train ban stopping,
 'Bout sax hours to vait;
Yiminy! Dis ban yolly, - 
 Stealing ride on freight.

Ay skol stretch a little
 Yust to tak a sleep;
Den my head bump into
 Gude big fader sheep.
Yee! His head ban harder
 Sum a china plate;
Dis ban yolly doings, - 
 Stealing ride on freight.

Yumping over crossings,
 Bumping over svitches,
Till my side ban getting
 Saxty-seven stitches.
Ay hear brakeman faller
 Say, "Yust ten hours late!"
It ban hal, ay tal yu,
 Stealing ride on freight.
