title: Happy, Happy It Is To Be
---

 "Happy, happy it is to be
 Where the greenwood hangs o'er the dark blue sea;
 To roam in the moonbeams clear and still
 And dance with the elves
 Over dale and hill;
 To taste their cups, and with them roam
 The field for dewdrops and honeycomb.
 Climb then, and come, as quick as you can,
 And dwell with the fairies, Elizabeth Ann!

 "Never, never, comes tear or sorrow,
 In the mansions old where the fairies dwell;
 But only the harping of their sweet harp-strings,
 And the lonesome stroke of a distant bell,
 Where upon hills of thyme and heather,
 The shepherd sits with his wandering sheep;
 And the curlew wails, and the skylark hovers
 Over the sand where the conies creep;
 Climb then, and come, as quick as you can,
 And dwell with the fairies, Elizabeth Ann!"
