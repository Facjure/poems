 Your pen needs but a ruffle
 To be Pavlova whirling.
 It surely is a scalawag
 A-scamping down the page.
 A pretty little May-wind
 The morning buds uncurling.
 And then the white sweet Russian,
 The dancer of the age.

 Your pen's the Queen of Sheba,
 Such serious questions bringing,
 That merry rascal Solomon
 Would show a sober face: - 
 And then again Pavlova
 To set our spirits singing,
 The snowy-swan bacchante
 All glamour, glee and grace.
