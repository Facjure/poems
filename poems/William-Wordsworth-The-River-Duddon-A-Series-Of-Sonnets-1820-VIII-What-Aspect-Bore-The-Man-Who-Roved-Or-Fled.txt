title: The River Duddon - A Series Of Sonnets, 1820. - VIII - What Aspect Bore The Man Who Roved Or Fled
---

 What aspect bore the Man who roved or fled,
 First of his tribe, to this dark dell who first
 In this pellucid Current slaked his thirst?
 What hopes came with him? what designs were spread
 Along his path? His unprotected bed
 What dreams encompassed? Was the intruder nursed
 In hideous usages, and rites accursed,
 That thinned the living and disturbed the dead?
 No voice replies; both air and earth are mute;
 And Thou, blue Streamlet, murmuring yield'st no more
 Than a soft record, that, whatever fruit
 Of ignorance thou might'st witness heretofore,
 Thy function was to heal and to restore,
 To soothe and cleanse, not madden and pollute!
