If one could have a hundred years to live,
 After the settlement of youth's unrest,
A hundred years of vigorous life to give
 To the pursuit of what he counted best,
A hundred summers, autumns, winters, springs,
 To train and use the forces of his mind,
He might fulfil his fond imaginings,
 And lift himself and benefit his kind.

O faint of heart, to whom this life appears
 Too short for thy ambitious projects, He
Who plied His task in weakness and in tears
 Along the countrysides of Galilee,
And blest the world for these two thousand years,
 Did His incomparable work in three.
