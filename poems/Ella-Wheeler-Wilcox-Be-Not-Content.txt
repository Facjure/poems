title: Be Not Content
---

Be not content - contentment means inaction;
 The growing soul aches on its upward quest;
Satiety is twin to satisfaction;
 All great achievements spring from life's unrest.

The tiny roots, deep in the dark mould hiding,
 Would never bless the earth with leaf and flower
Were not an inborn restlessness abiding
 In seed and germ, to stir them with its power.

Were man contented with his lot forever,
 He had not sought strange seas with sails unfurled,
And the vast wonder of our shores had never
 Dawned on the gaze of an admiring world.

Prize what is yours, but be not quite contented.
 There is a healthful restlessness of soul
By which a mighty purpose is augmented
 In urging men to reach a higher goal.

So when the restless impulse rises, driving
 Your calm content before it, do not grieve;
It is the upward reaching of the spirit
 Of the God in you to achieve -achieve.
