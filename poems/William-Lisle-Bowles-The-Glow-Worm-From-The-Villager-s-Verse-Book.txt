title: The Glow-Worm. (From The Villager's Verse-Book.)
---

 Oh, what is this which shines so bright,
And in the lonely place
Hangs out his small green lamp at night,
The dewy bank to grace!

 It is a glow-worm, still and pale
It shines the whole night long,
When only stars, O nightingale,
Seem listening to thy song!

 And so amid the world's cold night,
Through good report or ill,
Shines out the humble Christian's light,
As lonely and as still.
