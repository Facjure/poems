 "Now what is that, my daughter dear, upon thy cheek so fair?"
 "'Tis but a kiss, my mother dear - kind fortune sent it there.
 It was a courteous stranger-man that gave it unto me,
 And it is passing red because it was the last of three."

 "A kiss indeed! my daughter dear; I marvel in surprise!
 Such conduct with a stranger-man I fear me was not wise."
 "Methought the same, my mother dear, and so at three forbore,
 Although the courteous stranger-man vowed he had many more."

 "Now prithee, daughter, quickly go, and bring the stranger here,
 And bid him hie and bid him fly to me, my daughter dear;
 For times be very, very hard, and blessings eke so rare,
 I fain would meet a stranger-man that hath a kiss to spare."
