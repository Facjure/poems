title: The Alchemy of Sadness

One man lights you with his ardour
one decks you in mourning, Nature!
What says to the first: �A Sepulchre!�
To the other cries: �Life and splendour!�


Unknown Hermes, who assists,
yet intimidates me as well,
you make me Midas� equal,
the saddest of alchemists:


You help me change gold to iron,
paradise to hell�s kingdom:
in the shrouded atmosphere


I find a dear corpse, and on
the celestial shores, it�s there,
I build a mighty sepulcher.
