With a sullen, setting Sun,
It will come!
With the days of Despots done,
It will come!
With a sullen, setting Sun,
With the days of Despots done,
With the wrath of God begun,
It will come!
It will come!

With a ruddy, bloody Moon,
It will come!
With remorseless slaughter soon,
It will come!
With a ruddy, bloody Moon,
With remorseless slaughter soon,
With our Tyrants stripped and strewn,
It will come!
It will come!

With a meteoric glare,
It will come!
With Destruction in the air.
It will come!
With a meteoric glare,
With Destruction in the air,
With the vengeance of Despair,
It will come!
It will come!

With abasement of the proud,
It will come!
With the last King's crimson shroud,
It will come!
With abasement of the proud,
With the last King's crimson shroud,
But with Christ within the cloud,
It will come!
It will come!

With the merry Morning Stars,
It will come!
With the end of royal wars,
It will come!
With the merry Morning Stars,
With the end of royal wars,
With the last of scourging Tsars,
It will come!
It will come!

Yea! An angel from the fight,
It will come!
With fair Liberty in light,
It will come!
Yea! An angel from the fight,
With fair Liberty in light,
Linked with Everlasting Right,
It will come!
It will come!

By the Christ who hears our cries,
It will come!
By the Spirit of the Skies,
It will come!
By the Christ who hears our cries,
By the Spirit of the Skies,
By the God who never lies,
It will come!
It will come!

With a place for you and me,
It will come!
At the feastings of the Free,
It will come!
With a place for you and me,
At the feastings of the Free,
With eternal Jubilee,
It will come!
It will come!
