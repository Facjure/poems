 Three and thirty birds there stood
 In an elder in a wood;
 Called Melmillo - flew off three,
 Leaving thirty in a tree;
 Called Melmillo - nine now gone,
 And the boughs held twenty-one;
 Called Melmillo - eighteen
 Left but three to nod and preen;
 Called Melmillo - three - two - one - 
 Now of birds were feathers none.

 Then stole slim Melmillo in
 To that wood all dusk and green,
 And with lean long palms outspread
 Softly a strange dance did tread;
 Not a note of music she
 Had for echoing company;
 All the birds were flown to rest
 In the hollow of her breast;
 In the wood thorn, elder, willow - 
 Danced alone - lone danced Melmillo.
