title: Man
---

In the old air
by his rocker,
a silent trapeze of thought
suspends an aging man.

Each movement as of the katydid
droning -
a monologue with the past;
a buzz escaping across
still, warm air.
Elsewhere, cicadas whittle about the octogenarian heat.

Nestled quietly, a supine stare erodes both time &amp; place
unto bearded grey -
nuances clasped
in a breathless chat with death.
