I loved a little maiden
 In the golden years gone by;
She lived in a mill, as they all do
 (There is doubtless a reason why).
But she faded in the autumn
 When the leaves began to fade,
And the night before she faded,
 These words to me she said:
'Do not forget me, Henry,
 Be noble and brave and true;
But I must not bide, for the world is wide,
 And the sky above is blue.'

So I said farewell to my darling,
 And sailed away and came back;
 And the good ship Jane was in port again,
 And I found that they all loved Jack.
But Polly and I were sweethearts,
 As all the neighbours know,
Before I met with the mill-girl
 Twenty years ago.
So I thought I would go and see her,
 But alas, she had faded too!
She could not bide, for the world was wide,
 And the sky above was blue.

And now I can only remember
 The maid--the maid of the mill,
And Polly, and one or two others
 In the churchyard over the hill.
And I sadly ask the question,
 As I weep in the yew-tree's shade
With my elbow on one of their tombstones,
 'Ah, why did they all of them fade?'
 And the answer I half expected
 Comes from the solemn yew,
'They could none of them bide, for the world was wide,
 And the sky above was blue.'
