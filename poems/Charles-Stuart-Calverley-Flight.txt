O memory! that which I gave thee
 To guard in thy garner yestreen -
Little deeming thou e'er could'st behave thee
 Thus basely - hath gone from thee clean!
Gone, fled, as ere autumn is ended
 The yellow leaves flee from the oak -
I have lost it for ever, my splendid
 Original joke.

What was it? I know I was brushing
 My hair when the notion occurred:
I know that I felt myself blushing
 As I thought, "How supremely absurd!
"How they'll hammer on floor and on table
 As its drollery dawns on them - how
They will quote it" - I wish I were able
 To quote it just now.

I had thought to lead up conversation
 To the subject - it's easily done -
Then let off, as an airy creation
 Of the moment, that masterly pun.
Let it off, with a flash like a rocket's;
 In the midst of a dazzled conclave,
Where I sat, with my hands in my pockets,
 The only one grave.

I had fancied young Titterton's chuckles,
 And old Bottleby's hearty guffaws
As he drove at my ribs with his knuckles,
 His mode of expressing applause:
While Jean Bottleby - queenly Miss Janet -
 Drew her handkerchief hastily out,
In fits at my slyness - what can it
 Have all been about?

I know 'twas the happiest, quaintest
 Combination of pathos and fun:
But I've got no idea - the faintest -
 Of what was the actual pun.
I think it was somehow connected
 With something I'd recently read -
Or heard - or perhaps recollected
 On going to bed.

What HAD I been reading? The Standard:
 "Double Bigamy;" "Speech of the Mayor."
And later - eh? yes! I meandered
 Through some chapters of Vanity Fair.
How it fuses the grave with the festive!
 Yet e'en there, there is nothing so fine -
So playfully, subtly suggestive -
 As that joke of mine.

Did it hinge upon "parting asunder?"
 No, I don't part my hair with my brush.
Was the point of it "hair?" Now I wonder!
 Stop a bit - I shall think of it - hush!
There's HARE, a wild animal - Stuff!
 It was something a deal more recondite:
Of that I am certain enough;
 And of nothing beyond it.

Hair - LOCKS! There are probably many
 Good things to be said about those.
Give me time - that's the best guess of any -
 "Lock" has several meanings, one knows.
Iron locks - IRON-GRAY LOCKS - a "deadlock" -
 That would set up an everyday wit:
Then of course there's the obvious "wedlock;"
 But that wasn't it.

No! mine was a joke for the ages;
 Full of intricate meaning and pith;
A feast for your scholars and sages -
 How it would have rejoiced Sidney Smith!
'Tis such thoughts that ennoble a mortal;
 And, singing him out from the herd,
Fling wide immortality's portal -
 But what was the word?

Ah me! 'tis a bootless endeavour.
 As the flight of a bird of the air
Is the flight of a joke - you will never
 See the same one again, you may swear.
'Twas my firstborn, and O how I prized it!
 My darling, my treasure, my own!
This brain and none other devised it -
 And now it has flown.
