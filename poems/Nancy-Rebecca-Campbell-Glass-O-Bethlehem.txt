title: O Bethlehem!

"For he is our peace."


O Bethlehem, where Christ was born
And angels watched him where he lay,
When cradled on that holy morn
That ushered in earth's promised day!

O Bethlehem, it was thy star
Which guided o'er the deserts wild
Those who had journeyed from afar
To gaze upon the sinless child!

O Bethlehem, 'twas thine to see
God's choir announce the Saviour's birth,
And hear those waves of melody
Chant peace and good will to the earth!

O Bethlehem, 'twas thine to weep
With Rachel o'er the crimson woe
When cruel hands did vainly seek
To quench heaven's radiance below!

O Bethlehem, we hear thy call
To joy and bliss, and would not cease
To praise him who has died for all
Who will accept his blood-bought peace!
