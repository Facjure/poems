 "If I die first," my old chum paused to say,
 "Mind! not a whimper of regret: - instead,
Laugh and be glad, as I shall. - Being dead,
 I shall not lodge so very far away
 But that our mirth shall mingle. - So, the day
The word comes, joy with me." "I'll try," I said,
Though, even speaking, sighed and shook my head
 And turned, with misted eyes. His roundelay
 Rang gaily on the stair; and then the door
Opened and - closed. . . . Yet something of the clear,
 Hale hope, and force of wholesome faith he had
 Abided with me - strengthened more and more. -
Then - then they brought his broken body here:
 And I laughed - whisperingly - and we were glad.
