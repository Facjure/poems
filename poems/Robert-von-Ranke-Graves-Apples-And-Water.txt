title: Apples And Water.
---

 Dust in a cloud, blinding weather,
 Drums that rattle and roar!
 A mother and daughter stood together
 Beside their cottage door.

 "Mother, the heavens are bright like brass,
 The dust is shaken high,
 With labouring breath the soldiers pass,
 Their lips are cracked and dry."

 "Mother, I'll throw them apples down,
 I'll bring them pails of water."
 The mother turned with an angry frown
 Holding back her daughter.

 "But mother, see, they faint with thirst,
 They march away to die,"
 "Ah, sweet, had I but known at first
 Their throats are always dry."

 "There is no water can supply them
 In western streams that flow,
 There is no fruit can satisfy them
 On orchard trees that grow."

 "Once in my youth I gave, poor fool,
 A soldier apples and water,
 So may I die before you cool
 Your father's drouth, my daughter."
