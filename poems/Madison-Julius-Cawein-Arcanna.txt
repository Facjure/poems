 Earth hath her images of utterance,
 Her hieroglyphic meanings which elude;
 A symbol language of similitude,
 Into whose secrets science may not glance;
 In which the Mind-in-Nature doth romance
 In miracles that baffle if pursued
 No guess shall search them and no thought intrude
 Beyond the limits of her sufferance.
 So doth the great Intelligence above
 Hide His own thought's creations; and attire
 Forms in the dream's ideal, which He dowers
 With immaterial loveliness and love
 As essences of fragrance and of fire
 Preaching th' evangels of the stars and flowers.
