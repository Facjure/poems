 See, where his difficult way that Old Man wins
 Bent by a load of Mulberry leaves! most hard
 Appears 'his' lot, to the small Worm's compared,
 For whom his toil with early day begins.
 Acknowledging no task-master, at will
 (As if her labour and her ease were twins)
 'She' seems to work, at pleasure to lie still;
 And softly sleeps within the thread she spins.
 So fare they, the Man serving as her Slave.
 Ere long their fates do each to each conform:
 Both pass into new being, but the Worm,
 Transfigured, sinks into a hopeless grave;
 'His' volant Spirit will, he trusts, ascend
 To bliss unbounded, glory without end.
