title: Love's Coming.
---

 She had looked for his coming as warriors come,
 With the clash of arms and the bugle's call:
 But he came instead with a stealthy tread,
 Which she did not hear at all.

 She had thought how his armor would blaze in the sun,
 As he rode like a prince to claim his bride:
 In the sweet dim light of the falling night
 She found him at her side.

 She had dreamed how the gaze of his strange, bold eye
 Would wake her heart to a sudden glow:
 She found in his face the familiar grace
 Of a friend she used to know.

 She had dreamed how his coming would stir her soul,
 As the ocean is stirred by the wild storm's strife:
 He brought her the balm of a heavenly calm,
 And a peace which crowned her life.
