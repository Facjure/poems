title: The Day Before I Die
---

There's such a lot of work to do, for such a troubled head!
I�m scribbling this against a book, with foolscap round, in bed.
It strikes me that I�ll scribble much in this way by and by,
And write my last lines so perchance the day before I die.

There�s lots of things to come and go, and I, in careless rhyme,
And drink and love (it wastes the most) have wasted lots of time.
There�s so much good work to be done it makes me sure that I
Will be the sorriest for my death, the day before I die.

But, lift me dear, for I am tired, and let me taste the wine,
And lay your cheek a little while on this lined cheek of mine.
I want to say I love you so, your patient love is why
I�ll have such little time, you know, the day before I die.
