(Title of a French-Canadian song.)

O Canada, my country and my love,
Held in my heart all other lands above;
To thee to whom my homage should belong
I pay the cheerful tribute of my song,
And swear allegiance as on bended knee,
And vow undying fealty to thee,
O Canada, my country and my love.

I crave no land of epic story cast
In giant shadows on the misty past;
No land illustrious in former time,
Which has outlived the vigor of its prime;
No lordlier land renowned across the sea,
Nor any other land on earth but thee,
O Canada, my country and my love.

Past is thy night of darkness and of tears;
Thy radiant dawn hath driv'n away our fears;
Thy sun in morning splendor mounts the sky;
Thy hopes, thy aims, thy destinies are high.
God make thee great, as thou art fair and free,
And give thee sons and daughters worthy thee,
O Canada, my country and my love.

Eternal blessing rest upon thy head!
Abounding Plenty heap thy board with bread!
Justice and Peace upon thy steps attend,
And Virtue be thy guardian and thy friend!
And Righteousness, like thine own maple tree,
Flourish and rear her shelter over thee,
O Canada, my country and my love.
