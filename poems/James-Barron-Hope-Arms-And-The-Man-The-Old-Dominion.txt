Midway between the orange and the snows
As some fair planet rounds up from the sea,
Eldest of all, the Central Power arose
In vague immensity.

She stretched from Seas in sun to Lakes in Shade,
O'erstepped swift Rio Escondido's stream - 
Her bounds expressed, as by the Tudor made,
An Alexander's dream.

And liberal Stuart granted broad and free
Bound'ries which still the annalist may boast - 
Limits which ran "throughout from sea to sea,"
And far along the coast!

A mighty shaft through Raleigh's fingers slipped,
Smith shot it, and - a Continent awoke!
For that great arrow with an acorn tipped,
Planted an English Oak!
