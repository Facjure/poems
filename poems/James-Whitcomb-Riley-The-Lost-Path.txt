Alone they walked - their fingers knit together,
 And swaying listlessly as might a swing
Wherein Dan Cupid dangled in the weather
 Of some sun-flooded afternoon of Spring.

Within the clover-fields the tickled cricket
 Laughed lightly as they loitered down the lane,
And from the covert of the hazel-thicket
 The squirrel peeped and laughed at them again.

The bumble-bee that tipped the lily-vases
 Along the road-side in the shadows dim,
Went following the blossoms of their faces
 As though their sweets must needs be shared with him.

Between the pasture bars the wondering cattle
 Stared wistfully, and from their mellow bells
Shook out a welcoming whose dreamy rattle
 Fell swooningly away in faint farewells.

And though at last the gloom of night fell o'er them
 And folded all the landscape from their eyes,
They only know the dusky path before them
 Was leading safely on to Paradise.
