All night under the moon
 Plovers are flying
Over the dreaming meadows of silvery light,
Over the meadows of June,
 Flying and crying -
Wandering voices of love in the hush of the night.

All night under the moon,
 Love, though we're lying
Quietly under the thatch, in silvery light
Over the meadows of June
 Together we're flying -
Rapturous voices of love in the hush of the night?
