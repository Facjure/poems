Day of battle and day of blood
 Found you steady and strong, I ween;
Sons of the land of the Maple Leaf,
 Face to the foe, you died for the Queen.

Brave boys, our boys, filling to-day
 Nameless graves upon veldt and plain,
Here's to your mem'ry gallant and true,
 Sons of our soil, who thought it gain

To fight and win, or to fight and fall!
 Strong of purpose, you took your stand,
Proved with your life-blood red and warm
 Canada's faith in the Motherland!

Brave boys, our boys, this have you done,
 Drawn us closer, and bound us fast;
One are we with the Isle in the sea,
 One in the future, the present, the past.

Brave boys, our boys, honor we owe,
 Honor and homage a mighty debt - 
You proved our love and our loyalty - 
 The land that bore you will not forget!
Canada's soldiers, Canada's sons,
 The land that bore you will not forget!
