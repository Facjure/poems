	 There was a little man,
	 And he wooed a little maid,
	 And he said, Little maid, will you wed wed wed?
	 I have little more to say,
	 Then will you ay or nay,
	 For the least said is soonest mended ded ded.

	Homunculus eximius puellulam amavit,
	Quam ut nubendam duceret sic ore compellavit:
	Quid verbis opus pluribus? Dic _volo_, dicve _nolo_,
	Sat verbum sapientibus: responde sine dolo.

	 Then the little maid replied,
	 �Should I be your little bride,
	 Pray, what shall we have for to eat eat eat?
	 Will the flame that you are rich in
	 Make a fire in the kitchen,
	 Or the little god of love turn the spit spit spit?�

	Responsum dat puellula,--Si flectar ad nubendum
	Dic, qu�so, quid cibarii habebimus edendum?
	Amorem credis ignem in culin� servaturum,
	Aut parvulum Cupidinem jam veru versaturum?

	 Then the little man replied,
	 And, they say, a little sighed,
	 For his little heart was big with sorrow sorrow sorrow,
	 �My offers are but small,
	 But you have my little all;
	 And what we haven�t got we must borrow borrow borrow.�

	Replicuit homunculus suspiriis convulsus,
	Ingenti �gritudine cor parvulum perculsus,
	Non multa quidem profero, sed omnia relinquo;
	Et quicquid nobis deerit petemus a propinquo.

	 The little man thus spoke;
	 His heart was almost broke;
	 And all for the sake of her charms charms charms.
	 So the little maid relented,
	 And softened she consented
	 The little man to take to her arms arms arms.

	Sic fatur ille lacrymans ex corde desolato,
	Et propter pulchritudinem ad mortem vulnerato.
	Mollitur tum puellula, amorem et agnovit,
	Beatumque homunculum amplexu suo fovit.
