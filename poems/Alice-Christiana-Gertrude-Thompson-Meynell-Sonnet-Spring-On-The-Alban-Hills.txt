title: Sonnet - Spring On The Alban Hills
---

O'er the Campagna it is dim warm weather;
The Spring comes with a full heart silently,
And many thoughts; a faint flash of the sea
Divides two mists; straight falls the falling feather.

With wild Spring meanings hill and plain together
Grow pale, or just flush with a dust of flowers.
Rome in the ages, dimmed with all her towers,
Floats in the midst, a little cloud at tether.

I fain would put my hands about thy face,
Thou with thy thoughts, who art another Spring,
 And draw thee to me like a mournful child.

Thou lookest on me from another place;
I touch not this day's secret, nor the thing
 That in the silence makes thy sweet eyes wild.
