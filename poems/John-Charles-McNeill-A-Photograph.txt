 When in this room I turn in pondering pace
 And find thine eyes upon me where I stand,
 Led on, as by Enemo's silken strand,
 I come and gaze and gaze upon thy face.

 Framed round by silence, poised on pearl-white grace
 Of curving throat, too sweet for beaded band,
 It seems as if some wizard's magic wand
 Had wrought thee for the love of all the race.

 Dear face, that will not turn about to see
 The tulips, glorying in the casement sun,
 Or, other days, the drizzled raindrops run

 Down the damp walls, but follow only me,
 Would that Pygmalion's goddess might be won
 To change this lifeless image into thee!
