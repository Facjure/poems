 Show me again the time
 When in the Junetide's prime
 We flew by meads and mountains northerly! -
Yea, to such freshness, fairness, fulness, fineness, freeness,
 Love lures life on.

 Show me again the day
 When from the sandy bay
 We looked together upon the pestered sea! -
Yea, to such surging, swaying, sighing, swelling, shrinking,
 Love lures life on.

 Show me again the hour
 When by the pinnacled tower
 We eyed each other and feared futurity! -
Yea, to such bodings, broodings, beatings, blanchings, blessings,
 Love lures life on.

 Show me again just this:
 The moment of that kiss
 Away from the prancing folk, by the strawberry-tree! -
Yea, to such rashness, ratheness, rareness, ripeness, richness,
 Love lures life on.

Begun November 1898.
