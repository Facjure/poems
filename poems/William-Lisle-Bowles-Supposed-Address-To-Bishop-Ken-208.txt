 Though his words might well deceive me,
Though to earth abased I bend,
 Christian guide, thou wilt not leave me,
Thus on earth without a friend!

 I thought his vows were oaths in heaven,
Nor dare I here my fault deny;
 For all my soul to him was given,
God knows how true, how tenderly!

 Though wronged and desolate and dying,
His pride, his coldness, I forgot,
 And fell upon his bosom, crying,
Forsake me not - forsake me not!

 I left my father, and my mother,
Whom I no more on earth may see,
 But I have found a father, brother,
And more than every friend, in thee!

 Although his words might well deceive me,
Though wronged, and desolate I lie,
 Christian guide, thou wilt not leave me,
Oh, teach me to repent and die!
