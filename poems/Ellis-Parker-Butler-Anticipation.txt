I hold her letter as I stand,
Nor break the seal; no need to guess
What dainty little female hand
Penned this most delicate address.

The scented seal, I break it not,
But stand in stormy revery;
I tremble as I wonder what
She who penned this will say to me.

I wonder what my wife will say
If so it be she eï¿½er shall know
I only mailed her note today
It should have gone two weeks ago!
