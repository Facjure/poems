 There was merry-making
 When the first dart fell
 As a heralding, -
Till grinned the fully bared thing,
 And froze like a spell -
 Like a spell.

 Innocent was she,
 Innocent was I,
 Too simple we!
Before us we did not see,
 Nearing, aught wry -
 Aught wry!

 I can tell it not now,
 It was long ago;
 And such things cow;
But that is why and how
 Two lives were so -
 Were so.

 Yes, the years matured,
 And the blows were three
 That time ensured
On her, which she dumbly endured;
 And one on me -
 One on me.
