I niver thowt when I grew owd
 I'd tak to leetin' lamps;
I sud have said, I'd rayther pad
 My hoof on t' road wi' tramps.
But sin I gate that skelp(1) i' t' mine,
 I'm wankle(2) i' my heead;
So gaffer said, I'd give ower wark
 An' leet town lamps atsteead.

At first, when I were liggin' snug
 I' bed, warm as a bee,
'T were hard to rise and get agate
 As sooin as t' clock strake three.
An' I were flaid to hear my steps
 Echoin' on ivery wall;
An' flaider yet when down by t' church
 Ullets would skreek and call.

But now I'm flaid o' nowt; I love
 All unkerd(3) sounds o' t' neet,
Frae childer talkin' i' their dreams
 To t' tramp o' p'licemen' feet.
But most of all I love to hark
 To t' song o' t' birds at dawn;
They wakken up afore it gloams,
 When t' dew ligs thick on t' lawn.

If I feel lonesome, up I look
 To t' sky aboon my heead;
An' theer's yon stars all glestrin' breet,
 Like daisies in a mead.
But sometimes, when I'm glowerin' up,
 I see the Lord hissen;
He's doutin' all yon lamps o' Heaven
 That shines on mortal men.

He lowps alang frae star to star,
 As cobby(4) as can be;
Mebbe He reckons fowk's asleep,
 Wi' niver an eye to see.
But I hae catched Him at his wark,
 For all He maks no din;
He leaves a track o' powder'd gowd(5)
 To show where He has bin.

He's got big lamps an' laatle lamps,
 An' lamps that twinkles red;
Im capped to see Him dout 'em all
 Afore I'm back i' bed.
But He don't laik about His wark,
 Or stop to hark to t' birds;
He minds His business, does the Lord,
 An' wastes no gaumless words.

I grow more like Him ivery day,
 For all I walk so lame;
An', happen, there will coom a time
 I'll beat Him at His game.
Thrang as Throp's wife, I'll dout my lamps
 Afore He's gotten so far;
An' then I'll shout--"I've won my race,
 I've bet Him by a star."
