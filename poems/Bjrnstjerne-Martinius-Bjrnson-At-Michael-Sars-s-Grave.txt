(See Note 44)

 Ever he would roam
 Toward th' eternal home;
From the least life deep in ocean
To each gleam of stars in motion,
 Worth of all he weighed.
 Now the Lord lends aid.

 Still he passed beyond,
 Softly dreaming; fond
Nature met him as her lover.
God with strength his soul shall cover
 'Mid the starry throng
 Through the spheres' pure song.

 Even here on earth
 Harmony's sweet birth - 
When discovery new truth sunders,
When the small reveals its wonders - 
 Filled his soul with song
 For the ages long.

 Where his watch he kept,
 Eyes a hundred swept.
Where millenniums sand assembled,
Where the tiniest life-pulse trembled,
 There he sought the clue,
 Silent, wise, and true.

 In a water glass
 Searching he saw pass
All the ocean's life; his thinking
To unfathomed deeps was sinking;
 Where lay riddles locked,
 There he came and knocked.

 Fair our fatherland,
 While such faith shall stand!
With an eye so true and tender,
With a sense so fine for splendor
 In the small and still, - 
 Great ends we fulfil!
