I saw a black girl once,
 As black as winter's night;
Till through her parted lips
 There came a flood of light;
It was the milky way
 Across her face so black:
Her two lips closed again,
 And night came back.

I see a maiden now,
 Fair as a summer's day;
Yet through her parted lips
 I see the milky way;
It makes the broad daylight
 In summer time look black:
Her two lips close again,
 And night comes back.
