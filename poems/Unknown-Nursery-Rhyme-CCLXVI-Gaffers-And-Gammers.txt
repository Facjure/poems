[The first two lines of the following are the same with those of a song in D'Urfey's 'Pills to Purge Melancholy,' vol. v, p. 13.]

There was an old woman
Lived under a hill,
She put a mouse in a bag,
And sent it to mill;

The miller declar'd
By the point of his knife,
He never took toll
Of a mouse in his life.
