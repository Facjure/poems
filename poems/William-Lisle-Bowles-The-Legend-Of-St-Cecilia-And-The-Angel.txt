 'Twas when, O meekest eve! thy shadows dim
 Were slowly stealing round,
 With more impassioned sound
 Divine Cecilia sang her vesper hymn,
 And swelled the solemn chord
 In hallelujahs to thy name, O Lord!
 And now I see her raise
 Rapt adoration's gaze,
 With lips just opening, and with humid eyes
 Uplifted; whilst the strain
 Now sinks, now swells again;
 Now rising, seems to blend with heaven's own harmonies.
 But who is that, divinely fair,
 With more than mortal beauty in his mien;
 With eyes of heavenly hue and glistening hair,
 His white and ample wings half seen!
 O radiant and immortal guest!
Why hast thou left thy seraph throng,
 On earth the triumph to attest
Of Beauty, Piety, and Song!
