I.

In girandoles of gladioles
The day had kindled flame;
And Heaven a door of gold and pearl
Unclosed when Morning, like a girl,
A red rose twisted in a curl,
Down sapphire stairways came.

Said I to Love:"What must I do?
What shall I do? what can I do?"
Said I to Love:"What must I do?
All on a summer's morning."
Said Love to me:"Go woo, go woo."
Said Love to me:"Go woo.

If she be milking, follow, O!
And in the clover hollow, O!
While through the dew the bells clang clear,
Just whisper it into her ear,
All on a summer's morning."

II.

Of honey and heat and weed and wheat
The day had made perfume;
And Heaven a tower of turquoise raised,
Whence Noon, like some wan woman, gazed
A sunflower withering at her waist
Within a crystal room.

Said I to Love:"What must I do?
What shall I do? what can I do?"
Said I to Love:"What must I do,
All in the summer nooning?"
Said Love to me:"Go woo, go woo."
Said Love to me:"Go woo.

If she be 'mid the rakers, O!
Among the harvest acres, O!
While every breeze brings scents of hay,
Just hold her hand and not take 'nay,'
All in the summer nooning."

III.

With song and sigh and cricket cry
The day had mingled rest;
And Heaven a casement opened wide
Of opal, whence, like some young bride,
The Twilight leaned, all starry-eyed,
A moonflower on her breast.

Said I to Love:"What must I do?
What shall I do? what can I do?"
Said I to Love:"What must I do,
All in the summer gloaming?"
Said Love to me:"Go woo, go woo."
Said Love to me:"Go woo.

Go meet her at the trysting, O!
And, 'spite of her resisting, O!
Beneath the stars and afterglow,
Just clasp her close and kiss her so,
All in the summer gloaming."
