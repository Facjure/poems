Underneath the windy mountain walls
Forth we rode, an eager band,
By the surges and the verges and the gorges,
Till the night was on the land
On the hazy, mazy land!
Far away the bounding prey
Leapt across the ruts and logs,
But we galloped, galloped, galloped on,
Till we heard the yapping of the dogs
The yapping and the yelping of the dogs.

Oh, it was a madly merry day
We shall not so soon forget,
And the edges and the ledges and the ridges
Haunt us with their echoes yet
Echoes, echoes, echoes yet!
While the moon is on the hill
Gleaming through the streaming fogs,
Donï¿½t you hear the yapping of the dogs
The yapping and the yelping of the dogs?
