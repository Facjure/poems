Gray old gardener, what do you bring?
 "Laurel and ivy and bay,
With palms for the crowning of a King - 
 The morrow is Christmas Day.

"Holly with thorns, and berries like blood
 On its shiny greenness flung.
O the piercï¿½d side, and the thorny crown,
 And the cross whereon He hung!

"The mistletoe, meaning All-healing,
 Hangs close to the holly's thorn,
Lest we forget that on Christmas Day
 The Healer of Souls was born.

"Ivy's for faith; on the altar rail
 Let it creep where all may see;
It crept till it kissed a cheek so pale
 That night in Gethsemane.

"Bay's for remembrance, full and sweet;
 It speaks with its fragrant breath
Of manger and cross and a lowly tomb,
 And a love that conquered death.

"And laurel leaves for the wreath I bring,
 The laurel for victory,
And palms for the crowning of a King - 
 The morrow is Christmas Day."
