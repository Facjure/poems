 When my blood flows calm as a purling river,
 When my heart is asleep and my brain has sway,
 It is then that I vow we must part forever,
 That I will forget you, and put you away
 Out of my life, as a dream is banished
 Out of the mind when the dreamer awakes;
 That I know it will be, when the spell has vanished,
 Better for both of our sakes.

 When the court of the mind is ruled by Reason,
 I know it is wiser for us to part;
 But Love is a spy who is plotting treason,
 In league with that warm, red rebel, the Heart.
 They whisper to me that the King is cruel,
 That his reign is wicked, his law a sin;
 And every word they utter is fuel
 To the flame that smoulders within.

 And on nights like this, when my blood runs riot
 With the fever of youth and its mad desires,
 When my brain in vain bids my heart be quiet,
 When my breast seems the centre of lava-fires,
 Oh, then is the time when most I miss you,
 And I swear by the stars and my soul and say
 That I will have you and hold you and kiss you,
 Though the whole world stands in the way.

 And like Communists, as mad, as disloyal,
 My fierce emotions roam out of their lair;
 They hate King Reason for being royal;
 They would fire his castle, and burn him there.
 Oh, Love! they would clasp you and crush you and kill you,
 In the insurrection of uncontrol.
 Across the miles, does this wild war thrill you
 That is raging in my soul?
