In a garden sweet went walking
 Two lovers hand in hand;
Two pallid figures, low talking,
 They sat in the flowery land.

They kissed on the cheek one another,
 And they kissed upon the mouth;
They held in their arms each the other,
 And back came their health and youth.

Two little bells rang shrilly--
 And the lovely dream was dead!
She lay in the cloister chilly;
 He afar on his dungeon-bed.
