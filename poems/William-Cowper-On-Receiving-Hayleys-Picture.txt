title: On Receiving Hayley�s Picture.
---

In language warm as could be breathed or penn�d
Thy picture speaks the original, my friend,
Not by those looks that indicate thy mind�
They only speak thee friend of all mankind;
Expression here more soothing still I see,
That friend of all a partial friend to me.
