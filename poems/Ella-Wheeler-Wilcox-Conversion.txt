 I have lived this life as the skeptic lives it;
 I have said the sweetness was less than the gall;
 Praising, nor cursing, the Hand that gives it,
 I have drifted aimlessly through it all.
 I have scoffed at the tale of a so-called heaven;
 I have laughed at the thought of a Supreme Friend;
 I have said that it only to man was given
 To live, to endure; and to die was the end.

 But I know that a good God reigneth,
 Generous-hearted and kind and true;
 Since unto a worm like me he deigneth
 To send so royal a gift as you.
 Bright as a star you gleam on my bosom,
 Sweet as a rose that the wild bee sips;
 And I know, my own, my beautiful blossom,
 That none but a God could mould such lips.

 And I believe, in the fullest measure
 That ever a strong man's heart could hold,
 In all the tales of heavenly pleasure
 By poets sung or by prophets told;
 For in the joy of your shy, sweet kisses,
 Your pulsing touch and your languid sigh
 I am filled and thrilled with better blisses
 Than ever were claimed for souls on high.

 And now I have faith in all the stories
 Told of the beauties of unseen lands;
 Of royal splendors and marvellous glories
 Of the golden city not made with hands
 For the silken beauty of falling tresses,
 Of lips all dewy and cheeks aglow,
 With - what the mind in a half trance guesses
 Of the twin perfection of drifts of snow;

 Of limbs like marble, of thigh and shoulder
 Carved like a statue in high relief - 
 These, as the eyes and the thoughts grow bolder,
 Leave no room for an unbelief.
 So my lady, my queen most royal,
 My skepticism has passed away;
 If you are true to me, true and loyal,
 I will believe till the Judgment-day.
