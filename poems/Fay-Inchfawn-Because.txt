(PSALM CXVI.)

Because He heard my voice, and answered me,
Because He listened, ah, so patiently,
In those dark days, when sorrowful, alone,
I knelt with tears, and prayed Him for a stone;
Because He said me "Nay," and then in- stead,
Oh, wonderful sweet truth! He gave me bread,
Set my heart singing all in sweet accord;
Because of this, I love -- I love the Lord!
