title: On Sturminster Foot-Bridge - Onomatopoeic
---

Reticulations creep upon the slack stream's face
 When the wind skims irritably past,
The current clucks smartly into each hollow place
That years of flood have scrabbled in the pier's sodden base;
 The floating-lily leaves rot fast.

On a roof stand the swallows ranged in wistful waiting rows,
 Till they arrow off and drop like stones
Among the eyot-withies at whose foot the river flows;
And beneath the roof is she who in the dark world shows
 As a lattice-gleam when midnight moans.
