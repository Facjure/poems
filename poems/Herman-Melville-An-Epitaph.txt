 When Sunday tidings from the front
 Made pale the priest and people,
 And heavily the blessing went,
 And bells were dumb in the steeple;
 The Soldier's widow (summering sweerly here,
 In shade by waving beeches lent)
 Felt deep at heart her faith content,
 And priest and people borrowed of her cheer.
