title: Life Is Too Short.
---

 Life is too short for any vain regretting;
 Let dead delight bury its dead, I say,
 And let us go upon our way forgetting
 The joys and sorrows of each yesterday
 Between the swift sun's rising and its setting
 We have no time for useless tears or fretting:
 Life is too short.

 Life is too short for any bitter feeling;
 Time is the best avenger if we wait;
 The years speed by, and on their wings bear healing;
 We have no room for anything like hate.
 This solemn truth the low mounds seem revealing
 That thick and fast about our feet are stealing:
 Life is too short.

 Life is too short for aught but high endeavor - 
 Too short for spite, but long enough for love.
 And love lives on forever and forever;
 It links the worlds that circle on above:
 'Tis God's first law, the universe's lever.
 In His vast realm the radiant souls sigh never
 "Life is too short."
