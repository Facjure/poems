Matilda Jane wor fat an fair,
An nobbut just sixteen;
Shoo'd ruddy cheeks an reddish hair,
An leet blue wor her een.
Shoo weighed abaat two hundred pund,
Or may be rayther mooar,
Shoo had to turn her sideways
When shoo went aght o'th' door.

Shoo fairly dithered as shoo walked,
Shoo wor as brooad as long;
But allus cheerful when shoo tawk'd,
An liked to sing a song;
An some o'th' songs shoo used to sing,
Aw weel remember yet;
Aw thowt it sich a funny thing,
Shoo pickt soa strange a set,

"Put me in my little bed,"
Aw knew they couldn't do;
For onny bed to put her in,
Must be big enuff for two.
"Aw wish aw wor a burd," shoo sang,
Aw nivver could tell why, - 
For it wod be a waste o' wings
Becoss shoo couldn't fly.

"I'd choose to be a Daisy,"
Aw didn't wonder at,
For it must ha made her crazy
To hug that looad o' fat.
Then "Flitting like a Fairy;" - 
To hear it gave me pain,
For ther wor novvt soa airy
Abaat Matilda Jane.

Last time aw heeard her singin,
Shoo sang "You'll remember me,"
An mi arm crept pairtly raand her,
As aw held her on mi knee.
Ther's noa fear aw shall forget her,
Tho' shoo's ne'er set thear agean,
But if shoo will, aw'll let her,
For aw like Matilda Jane.
