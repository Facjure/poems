LX.

They have company this evening,
 And the house is full of light;
Up there at the shining window
 Moves a shadowy form in white.

Thou seest me not--in the darkness
 I stand here below, apart;
Yet less, ah less thou seest
 Into my gloomy heart!

My gloomy heart it loves thee,
 Loves thee in every spot:
It breaks, it bleeds, it shudders--But
 into it thou seest not!


LXII.

Diamonds hast thou, and pearls,
 And all by which men lay store;
And of eyes thou hast the fairest--
 Darling, what wouldst thou more?

Upon thine eyes so lovely
 Have I a whole army-corps
Of undying songs composed--
 Dearest, what wouldst thou more?

And with thine eyes so lovely
 Thou hast tortured me very sore,
And hast ruined me altogether--
 Darling, what wouldst thou more?
