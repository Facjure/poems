About the bush, Willy,
About the bee-hive,
About the bush, Willy,
I'll meet thee alive.

Then to my ten shillings,
Add you but a groat,
I'll go to Newcastle,
And buy a new coat.

Five and five shillings,
Five and a crown;
Five and five shillings,
Will buy a new gown.

Five and five shillings,
Five and a groat;
Five and five shillings,
Will buy a new coat.
