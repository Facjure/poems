'Tis merry ov a zummer's day,
When vo'k be out a-haul�n hay,
Where boughs, a-spread upon the ground,
Do me�ke the staddle big an' round;
An' grass do stand in pook, or lie
In long-backed we�les or parsels, dry.
There I do vind it stir my heart
To hear the froth�n hosses snort,
A-haul�n on, wi' sleek he�ir'd hides,
The red-wheel'd waggon's deep-blue zides.
Aye; let me have woone cup o' drink,
An' hear the linky harness clink,
An' then my blood do run so warm,
An' put sich strangth 'ithin my e�rm,
That I do long to toss a pick,
A-pitch�n or a-me�k�n rick.

The bwoy is at the hosse's head,
An' up upon the waggon bed
The lwoaders, strong o' e�rm do stan',
At head, an' back at ta�l, a man,
Wi' skill to build the lwoad upright
An' bind the vwolded corners tight;
An' at each zide o'm, sprack an' strong,
A pitcher wi' his long-stem'd prong,
Avore the best two women now
A-call'd to re�ky after plough.

When I do pitchy, 'tis my pride
Vor Jenny Hine to re�ke my zide,
An' zee her fling her re�ke, an' reach
So vur, an' te�ke in sich a streech;
An' I don't shatter hay, an' me�ke
Mwore work than needs vor Jenny's re�ke.
I'd sooner zee the we�les' high rows
Lik' hedges up above my nose,
Than have light work myzelf, an' vind
Poor Je�ne a-be�t an' left behind;
Vor she would sooner drop down dead,
Than let the pitchers get a-head.

'Tis merry at the rick to zee
How picks do wag, an' hay do vlee.
While woone's unlwoad�n, woone do te�ke
The pitches in; an' zome do me�ke
The lofty rick upright an' roun',
An' tread en hard, an' re�ke en down,
An' tip en, when the zun do zet,
To shoot a sudden vall o' wet.
An' zoo 'tis merry any day
Where vo'k be out a-carr�n hay.
