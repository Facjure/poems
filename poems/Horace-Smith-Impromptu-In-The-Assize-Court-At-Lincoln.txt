Sir W. Bovill was specially retained in an action for damages caused by the overflowing of the banks of the Witham. With great spirit he contended that the river had for three days flowed from the sea.

The moon in the valley of Ajalon
 Stood still at the word of the prophet;
But since certain "Essays" were written
 We don't think so very much of it.
Now, a prophet is raised up among us,
 Whose miracles none can gainsay;
For he spoke, and the great river Witham
 Flowed three days, uphill, the wrong way.
