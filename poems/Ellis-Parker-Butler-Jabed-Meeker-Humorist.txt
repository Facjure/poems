title: Jabed Meeker, Humorist
---

Twain? Oh, yes, I�ve heard Mark Twain
Heard him down to Pleasant Plain;
Funny? Yes, I guess so. Folks
Seemed to laugh loud at his jokes,
Laughed to beat the band; but I
Couldn�t rightly make out why.
Guess his humor ain�t refined.
Quite enough to suit my mind.
Mark�s all right, right clever speaker,
But he can�t touch Jabed Meeker;
And one thing that makes it queer
Is that Jabed lives right here.

You ain�t met him? Son, you�ve missed
The most funniest humorist
I�ve met with in my born days,
Funniest talker, anyways,
When it comes to repartee,
That�s the humor catches me!

Like a specimen? Huh! Well,
Take, for instance, his umbrell;
Wouldn�t think, until he spoke,
He could turn that to a joke;
Mark Twain couldn�t, bet you that!
That�s where Meeker beats Mark flat!

Just imagine three or four
Fellers in Jim Beemer�s store,
�Long comes Meeker, and some feller
Says, �See Meeker�s bum umbreller.�
Quick as lightning Meeker �d yell:
�Don�t you guy my bumberell!
Where�s the feller dares to hoot
At this sping-spang bumbershoot?
Show me some one dares to call
Bad names at my bumbersoll!�
Right like that! Right off the reel!
Say, you�d ought to heard us squeal!
Then, before we�d got our breath,
Meeker, solemn sad as death,
Says: �Stand up there �gainst that wall,
Para-bumber-shooter-soll!�

Twain? All right! But just give me
Some one slick at repartee!
