I saw him steal the light away
 That haunted in her eye:
It went so gently none could say
More than that it was there one day
 And missing by-and-by.

I watched her longer, and he stole
 Her lily tincts and rose;
All her young sprightliness of soul
Next fell beneath his cold control,
 And disappeared like those.

I asked: "Why do you serve her so?
 Do you, for some glad day,
Hoard these her sweets - ?" He said, "O no,
They charm not me; I bid Time throw
 Them carelessly away."

Said I: "We call that cruelty -
 We, your poor mortal kind."
He mused. "The thought is new to me.
Forsooth, though I men's master be,
 Theirs is the teaching mind!"
