A little cock sparrow sat on a green tree, ( tris)
And he cherruped, he cherruped so merry was he; ( tris)
A little cock-sparrow sat on a green tree,
And he cherruped, he cherruped so merry was he.

A naughty boy came with his wee bow and arrow, ( tris)
Determined to shoot this little cock sparrow, ( tris)
A naughty, &amp; c.
Determined, &amp; c.

This little cock sparrow shall make me a stew, ( tris)
And his giblets shall make me a little pie too, ( tris)
Oh, no! said ye sparrow I won't make a stew,
So he flapped his wings and away he flew!
