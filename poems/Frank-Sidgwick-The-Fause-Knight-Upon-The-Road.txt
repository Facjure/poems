The Text is taken from the Introduction to Motherwell's Minstrelsy, p. lxxiv.


The Story appears to be a conversation between a wee boy and the devil, the latter under the guise of a knight. The boy will be carried off unless he can 'have the last word,' a charm of great power against all evil spirits.

A very similar ballad, of repartees between an old crone and a wee boy, was found at the Lappfiord, Finland.


THE FAUSE KNIGHT UPON THE ROAD

1.
'O whare are ye gaun?'
Quo the fause knicht upon the road:
'I'm gaun to the scule,'
Quo' the wee boy, and still he stude.

'Atweel it is my bukes.'

'I wiss ye were on yon tree:'
'And a gude ladder under me.'

'And the ladder for to break:'
'And you for to fa' down.'

'And a gude bottom under me.'
