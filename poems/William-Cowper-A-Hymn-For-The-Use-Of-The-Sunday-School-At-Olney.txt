Hear, Lord, the song of praise and prayer
In heaven thy dwelling-place,
From infants made the public care,
And taught to seek thy face.


Thanks for thy word and for thy day,
And grant us, we implore,
Never to waste in sinful play
Thy holy Sabbaths more.


Thanks that we hear�but O! impart
To each desires sincere,
That we may listen with our heart,
And learn as well as hear.


For if vain thoughts the mind engage
Of older far than we,
What hope, that, at our heedless age,
Our minds should e�er be free?


Much hope, if thou our spirits take
Under thy gracious sway,
Who canst the wisest wiser make,
And babes as wise as they.


Wisdom and bliss thy word bestows,
A sun that ne�er declines,
And be thy mercies shower�d on those
Who placed us where it shines.
