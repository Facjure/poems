title: My Bride That Is To Be
---

O soul of mine, look out and see
 My bride, my bride that is to be!
 Reach out with mad, impatient hands,
And draw aside futurity
As one might draw a veil aside -
 And so unveil her where she stands
Madonna-like and glorified -
 The queen of undiscovered lands
Of love, to where she beckons me -
My bride - my bride that is to be.

The shadow of a willow-tree
 That wavers on a garden-wall
 In summertime may never fall
In attitude as gracefully
As my fair bride that is to be; -
 Nor ever Autumn's leaves of brown
As lightly flutter to the lawn
As fall her fairy-feet upon
 The path of love she loiters down. -
O'er drops of dew she walks, and yet
Not one may stain her sandal wet -
Aye, she might dance upon the way
Nor crush a single drop to spray,
So airy-like she seems to me, -
My bride, my bride that is to be.

I know not if her eyes are light
As summer skies or dark as night, -
I only know that they are dim
 With mystery: In vain I peer
 To make their hidden meaning clear,
 While o'er their surface, like a tear
That ripples to the silken brim,
A look of longing seems to swim
 All worn and wearylike to me;
And then, as suddenly, my sight
Is blinded with a smile so bright,
 Through folded lids I still may see
 My bride, my bride that is to be.

Her face is like a night of June
Upon whose brow the crescent-moon
Hangs pendant in a diadem
Of stars, with envy lighting them. -
 And, like a wild cascade, her hair
Floods neck and shoulder, arm and wrist,
Till only through a gleaming mist
 I seem to see a siren there,
With lips of love and melody
 And open arms and heaving breast
 Wherein I fling myself to rest,
The while my heart cries hopelessly
For my fair bride that is to be....

Nay, foolish heart and blinded eyes!
My bride hath need of no disguise. -
 But, rather, let her come to me
In such a form as bent above
 My pillow when in infancy
I knew not anything but love. -
O let her come from out the lands
 Of Womanhood - not fairy isles, -
And let her come with Woman's hands
 And Woman's eyes of tears and smiles, -
With Woman's hopefulness and grace
Of patience lighting up her face:
And let her diadem be wrought
Of kindly deed and prayerful thought,
That ever over all distress
May beam the light of cheerfulness. -
And let her feet be brave to fare
The labyrinths of doubt and care,
That, following, my own may find
The path to Heaven God designed. -
O let her come like this to me -
My bride - my bride that is to be.
