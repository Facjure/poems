OD. i. 24.


Unshamed, unchecked, for one so dear
 We sorrow. Lead the mournful choir,
 Melpomene, to whom thy sire
Gave harp, and song-notes liquid-clear!

Sleeps He the sleep that knows no morn?
 Oh Honour, oh twin-born with Right,
 Pure Faith, and Truth that loves the light,
When shall again his like be born?

Many a kind heart for Him makes moan;
 Thine, Virgil, first. But ah! in vain
 Thy love bids heaven restore again
That which it took not as a loan:

Were sweeter lute than Orpheus given
 To thee, did trees thy voice obey;
 The blood revisits not the clay
Which He, with lifted wand, hath driven

Into his dark assemblage, who
 Unlocks not fate to mortal's prayer.
 Hard lot! Yet light their griefs who BEAR
The ills which they may not undo.
