 On the damp margin of the sea-beat shore
Lonely at eve to wander; - or reclin'd
Beneath a rock, what time the rising wind
Mourns o'er the waters, and, with solemn roar,
 Vast billows into caverns surging pour,
And back recede alternate; while combin'd
Loud shriek the sea-fowls, harbingers assign'd,
Clamorous and fearful, of the stormy hour;
 To listen with deep thought those awful sounds;
Gaze on the boiling, the tumultuous waste,
Or promontory rude, or craggy mounds
 Staying the furious main, delight has cast
O'er my rapt spirit, and my thrilling heart,
Dear as the softer joys green vales impart.
