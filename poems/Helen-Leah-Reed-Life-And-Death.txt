"Death after life" shall we sigh as we say it,
Sigh as if death were the end for us all,
Pale at the thought, as in silence we weigh it,
Yield our dull souls to it, bending in thrall?

"Life after death" - look ahead, weakling spirit - 
Sure is the way to a world that is ours.
Death is fruition, why then should we fear it?
Death - the fruition of life's budding powers.
