title: Keep Going
---

Is the goal distant, and troubled the road,
 And the way long?
 And heavy your load?
Then gird up your courage, and say 'I am strong,'
 And keep going.

Is the work weary, and endless the grind
 And petty the pay?
 Then brace up your mind
And say 'Something better is coming my way,'
 And keep doing.

Is the drink bitter life pours in your cup - 
 Is the taste gall?
 Then smile and look up
And say 'God is with me whatever befall,'
 And keep trusting.

Is the heart heavy with hope long deferred,
 And with prayers that seem vain?
 Keep saying the word - 
And that which you strive for you yet shall attain.
 Keep praying.
