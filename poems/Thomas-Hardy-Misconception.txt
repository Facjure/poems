I busied myself to find a sure
 Snug hermitage
That should preserve my Love secure
 From the world's rage;
Where no unseemly saturnals,
 Or strident traffic-roars,
Or hum of intervolved cabals
 Should echo at her doors.

I laboured that the diurnal spin
 Of vanities
Should not contrive to suck her in
 By dark degrees,
And cunningly operate to blur
 Sweet teachings I had begun;
And then I went full-heart to her
 To expound the glad deeds done.

She looked at me, and said thereto
 With a pitying smile,
"And THIS is what has busied you
 So long a while?
O poor exhausted one, I see
 You have worn you old and thin
For naught! Those moils you fear for me
 I find most pleasure in!"
