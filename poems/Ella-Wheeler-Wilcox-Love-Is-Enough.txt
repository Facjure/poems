title: Love Is Enough
---

Love is enough.Let us not ask for gold.
 Wealth breeds false aims, and pride, and selfishness;
In those serene, Arcadian days of old
 Men gave no thought to princely homes and dress.
The gods who dwelt on fair Olympia's height
Lived only for dear love and love's delight.
Love is enough.

Love is enough.Why should we care for fame?
 Ambition is a most unpleasant guest:
It lures us with the glory of a name
 Far from the happy haunts of peace and rest.
Let us stay here in this secluded place
Made beautiful by love's endearing grace!
Love is enough.

Love is enough.Why should we strive for power?
 It brings men only envy and distrust.
The poor world's homage pleases but an hour,
 And earthly honours vanish in the dust.
The grandest lives are ofttimes desolate;
Let me be loved, and let who will be great.
Love is enough.

Love is enough.Why should we ask for more?
 What greater gift have gods vouchsafed to men?
What better boon of all their precious store
 Than our fond hearts that love and love again?
Old love may die; new love is just as sweet;
And life is fair and all the world complete:
Love is enough!
