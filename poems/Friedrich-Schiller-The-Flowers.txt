 Ye offspring of the morning sun,
 Ye flowers that deck the smiling plain,
 Your lives, in joy and bliss begun,
 In Nature's love unchanged remain.
 With hues of bright and godlike splendor
 Sweet Flora graced your forms so tender,
 And clothed ye in a garb of light;
 Spring's lovely children weep forever,
 For living souls she gave ye never,
 And ye must dwell in endless night?

 The nightingale and lark still sing
 In your tranced ears the bliss of love;
 The toying sylphs, on airy wing,
 Around your fragrant bosoms rove,
 Of yore, Dione's daughter [6] twining
 In garlands sweet your cup-so shining,
 A pillow formed where love might rest!
 Spring's gentle children, mourn forever,
 The joys of love she gave ye never,
 Ne'er let ye know that feeling blest!

 But when ye're gathered by my hand,
 A token of my love to be,
 Now that her mother's harsh command
 From Nanny's [7] sight has banished me
 E'en from that passing touch ye borrow
 Those heralds mute of pleasing sorrow,
 Life, language, hearts and souls divine;
 And to your silent leaves 'tis given,
 By Him who mightiest is in heaven,
 His glorious Godhead to enshrine.
