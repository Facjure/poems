Man is a bird:
 He rises on fine wings
Into the Heaven's clear light;
 He flies away and sings, 
There's music in his flight.

Man is a bird:
 In swiftest speed he burns,
With twist and dive and leap;
 A bird whose sudden turns
Can drive the frightened sheep.

Man is a bird:
 Over the mountain high,
Whose head is in the skies,
 Cut from its shoulder by
A cloud, the bird-man flies.

Man is a bird:
 Eagles from mountain crag
Swooped down to prove his worth;
 But now they rise to drag
Him down from Heaven to earth!
