And thus it came my feet were led
 To wizard walls that hairy hung
Old as their rock the moss made dead;
 And, like a ditch of fire flung
Around it, uncouth flowers red
 Thrust spur and fang and tongue.

And here I harped. Did dead men list?
 Or was it hollow hinges gnarred
Huge, iron scorn in donjon-twist?
 And when I thought a face sword-scarred
Would curse me, lo! a woman kissed
 At me hands ringed and starred.

And so I sang; for she had leaned
 Rare beauty to me, dark and tall;
I sang of Love, whose Court is queened
 Of Aliï¿½nor the virginal,
Nor saw how rolled on me a fiend
 Wolf-eyeballs from the wall.

Oh, how I sang! until she laughed
 Red lips that made lute harmony;
I sang of knights who fought and quaffed
 To Love's own paragon, Marie - 
Nor saw the suzerain whose shaft
 Was bowed and bent on me.

And I had harped until she wept;
 But when I sang of Ermengarde
Of Anjou, - where her Court is kept
 By brave, by beauty, and by bard, - 
She turned a raven there and swept
 Me, like a fury, 'ward.

A bleeding beak had pierced my sight;
 A crimson claw each cheek had lined;
One glimpse: wild walls of threatening night
 Heaped raven battlements behind
A moat of blazing serpents bright - 
 And then I wandered blind.
