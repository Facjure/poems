In the gruesome night and the wintry weather,
 I watched two dear friends die,
And I buried them both in one grave together.
 Oh! who is so sad as I?
For the old love, and the old year,
 They both have passed away;
And I never can find the old cheer
 Come what will or may.

I heard the bell in the tall church steeple
 Clang out a joyful strain.
And I thought, 'Of all the great world's people,
 I have the bitterest pain.'
For the old year was a good year,
 And the old love was sweet;
And how could my heart hold any cheer
 When both lay dead at my feet.

Life may smile and the skies may brighten,
 Winter will pass with its snows;
Grief will wane and the burden lighten -
 And June will come with the rose.
But it cannot bring the old cheer
 To fill my empty breast;
For the old year was the one year,
 And the old love was best.
