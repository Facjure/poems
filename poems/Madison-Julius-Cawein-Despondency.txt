 Not all the bravery that day puts on
 Of gold and azure, ardent or austere,
 Shall ease my soul of sorrow; grown more dear
 Than all the joy that heavenly hope may don.
 Far up the skies the rumor of the dawn
 May run, and eve like some wild torch appear;
 These shall not change the darkness, gathered here,
 Of thought, that rusts like an old sword undrawn.
 Oh, for a place deep-sunken from the sun!
 A wildwood cave of primitive rocks and moss!
 Where Sleep and Silence, breast to married breast
 Lie with their child, night-eyed Oblivion;
 Where, freed from all the trouble of my cross,
 I might forget, I might forget, and rest!
