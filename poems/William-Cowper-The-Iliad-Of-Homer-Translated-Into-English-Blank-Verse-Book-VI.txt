 ARGUMENT OF THE SIXTH BOOK.


The battle is continued. The Trojans being closely pursued, Hector by the advice of Helenus enters Troy, and recommends it to Hecuba to go in solemn procession to the temple of Minerva; she with the matrons goes accordingly. Hector takes the opportunity to find out Paris, and exhorts him to return to the field of battle. An interview succeeds between Hector and Andromache, and Paris, having armed himself in the mean time, comes up with Hector at the close of it, when they sally from the gate together.



 Thus was the field forsaken by the Gods.
 And now success proved various; here the Greeks
 With their extended spears, the Trojans there
 Prevail'd alternate, on the champain spread
 The Xanthus and the Simo�s between.[1]
 First Telamonian Ajax,[2] bulwark firm
 Of the Achaians, broke the Trojan ranks,
 And kindled for the Greeks a gleam of hope,
 Slaying the bravest of the Thracian band,
 Huge Acamas, Eusorus' son; him first
 Full on the shaggy crest he smote, and urged
 The spear into his forehead; through his skull
 The bright point pass'd, and darkness veil'd his eyes.
 But Diomede, heroic Chief, the son
 Of Teuthras slew, Axylus.[3] Rich was he,
 And in Arisba (where he dwelt beside
 The public road, and at his open door
 Made welcome all) respected and beloved.
 But of his numerous guests none interposed
 To avert his woful doom; nor him alone
 He slew, but with him also to the shades
 Calesius sent, his friend and charioteer.
 Opheltius fell and Dresus, by the hand
 Slain of Euryalus, who, next, his arms
 On Pedasus and on �sepus turned
 Brethren and twins. Them Abarbarea bore,
 A Naiad, to Bucolion, son renown'd
 Of King Laomedon, his eldest born,
 But by his mother, at his birth, conceal'd.
 Bucolion pasturing his flocks, embraced
 The lovely nymph; she twins produced, both whom,
 Brave as they were and beautiful, thy son[4]
 Mecisteus! slew, and from their shoulders tore
 Their armor. Dauntless Polypoetes slew
 Astyalus. Ulysses with his spear
 Transfixed Pydites, a Percosian Chief,
 And Teucer Areta�n; Nestor's pride
 Antilochus, with his bright lance, of life
 Bereft Ablerus, and the royal arm
 Of Agamemnon, Elatus; he dwelt
 Among the hills of lofty Pedasus,
 On Satnio's banks, smooth-sliding river pure
 Phylacus fled, whom Le�tus as swift
 Soon smote. Melanthius at the feet expired
 Of the renown'd Eurypylus, and, flush'd
 With martial ardor, Menelaus seized
 And took alive Adrastus. As it chanced
 A thicket his affrighted steeds detain'd
 Their feet entangling; they with restive force
 At its extremity snapp'd short the pole,
 And to the city, whither others fled,
 Fled also. From his chariot headlong hurl'd,
 Adrastus press'd the plain fast by his wheel.
 Flew Menelaus, and his quivering spear
 Shook over him; he, life imploring, clasp'd
 Importunate his knees, and thus exclaim'd.
 Oh, son of Atreus, let me live! accept
 Illustrious ransom! In my father's house
 Is wealth abundant, gold, and brass, and steel
 Of truest temper, which he will impart
 Till he have gratified thine utmost wish,
 Inform'd that I am captive in your fleet.
 He said, and Menelaus by his words
 Vanquish'd, him soon had to the fleet dismiss'd
 Given to his train in charge, but swift and stern
 Approaching, Agamemnon interposed.
 Now, brother, whence this milkiness of mind,
 These scruples about blood? Thy Trojan friends
 Have doubtless much obliged thee. Die the race!
 May none escape us! neither he who flies,
 Nor even the infant in his mother's womb
 Unconscious. Perish universal Troy
 Unpitied, till her place be found no more![5]
 So saying, his brother's mind the Hero turn'd,
 Advising him aright; he with his hand
 Thrust back Adrastus, and himself, the King,
 His bowels pierced. Supine Adrastus fell,
 And Agamemnon, with his foot the corse
 Impressing firm, pluck'd forth his ashen spear.
 Then Nestor, raising high his voice, exclaim'd.
 Friends, Heroes, Grecians, ministers of Mars!
 Let none, desirous of the spoil, his time
 Devote to plunder now; now slay your foes,
 And strip them when the field shall be your own.[6]
 He said, and all took courage at his word.
 Then had the Trojans enter'd Troy again
 By the heroic Grecians foul repulsed,
 So was their spirit daunted, but the son
 Of Priam, Helenus, an augur far
 Excelling all, at Hector's side his speech
 To him and to �neas thus address'd.
 Hector, and thou, �neas, since on you
 The Lycians chiefly and ourselves depend,
 For that in difficult emprize ye show
 Most courage; give best counsel; stand yourselves,
 And, visiting all quarters, cause to stand
 Before the city-gates our scatter'd troops,
 Ere yet the fugitives within the arms
 Be slaughter'd of their wives, the scorn of Greece.
 When thus ye shall have rallied every band
 And roused their courage, weary though we be,
 Yet since necessity commands, even here
 Will we give battle to the host of Greece.
 But, Hector! to the city thou depart;
 There charge our mother, that she go direct,
 With the assembled matrons, to the fane
 Of Pallas in the citadel of Troy.
 Opening her chambers' sacred doors, of all
 Her treasured mantles there, let her select
 The widest, most magnificently wrought,
 And which she values most; that let her spread
 On Athen�an Pallas' lap divine.[7]
 Twelve heifers of the year yet never touch'd
 With puncture of the goad, let her alike
 Devote to her, if she will pity Troy,
 Our wives and little ones, and will avert
 The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,
 That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host,
 Bravest, in my account, of all the Greeks.
 For never yet Achilles hath himself
 So taught our people fear, although esteemed
 Son of a Goddess. But this warrior's rage
 Is boundless, and his strength past all compare.
 So Helenus; nor Hector not complied.
 Down from his chariot instant to the ground
 All arm'd he leap'd, and, shaking his sharp spears,
 Through every phalanx pass'd, rousing again
 Their courage, and rekindling horrid war.
 They, turning, faced the Greeks; the Greeks repulsed,
 Ceased from all carnage, nor supposed they less
 Than that some Deity, the starry skies
 Forsaken, help'd their foes, so firm they stood.
 But Hector to the Trojans call'd aloud.
 Ye dauntless Trojans and confederate powers
 Call'd from afar! now be ye men, my friends,
 Now summon all the fury of your might!
 I go to charge our senators and wives
 That they address the Gods with prayers and vows
 For our success, and hecatombs devote.
 So saying the Hero went, and as he strode
 The sable hide that lined his bossy shield
 Smote on his neck and on his ancle-bone.
 And now into the middle space between
 Both hosts, the son of Tydeus and the son
 Moved of Hippolochus, intent alike
 On furious combat; face to face they stood,
 And thus heroic Diomede began.
 Most noble Champion! who of human kind
 Art thou,[8] whom in the man-ennobling fight
 I now encounter first? Past all thy peers
 I must esteem thee valiant, who hast dared
 To meet my coming, and my spear defy.
 Ah! they are sons of miserable sires
 Who dare my might; but if a God from heaven
 Thou come, behold! I fight not with the Gods.
 That war Lycurgus son of Dryas waged,
 And saw not many years. The nurses he
 Of brain-disturbing Bacchus down the steep
 Pursued of sacred Nyssa; they their wands
 Vine-wreathed cast all away, with an ox-goad
 Chastised by fell Lycurgus. Bacchus plunged
 Meantime dismay'd into the deep, where him
 Trembling, and at the Hero's haughty threats
 Confounded, Thetis in her bosom hid.[9]
 Thus by Lycurgus were the blessed powers
 Of heaven offended, and Saturnian Jove
 Of sight bereaved him, who not long that loss
 Survived, for he was curst by all above.
 I, therefore, wage no contest with the Gods;
 But if thou be of men, and feed on bread
 Of earthly growth, draw nigh, that with a stroke
 Well-aim'd, I may at once cut short thy days.[10]
 To whom the illustrious Lycian Chief replied.
 Why asks brave Diomede of my descent?
 For, as the leaves, such is the race of man.[11]
 The wind shakes down the leaves, the budding grove
 Soon teems with others, and in spring they grow.
 So pass mankind. One generation meets
 Its destined period, and a new succeeds.
 But since thou seem'st desirous to be taught
 My pedigree, whereof no few have heard,
 Know that in Argos, in the very lap
 Of Argos, for her steed-grazed meadows famed,
 Stands Ephyra;[12] there Sisyphus abode,
 Shrewdest of human kind; Sisyphus, named
 �olides. Himself a son begat,
 Glaucus, and he Bellerophon, to whom
 The Gods both manly force and beauty gave.
 Him Proetus (for in Argos at that time
 Proetus was sovereign, to whose sceptre Jove
 Had subjected the land) plotting his death,
 Contrived to banish from his native home.
 For fair Anteia, wife of Proetus, mad
 Through love of young Bellerophon, him oft
 In secret to illicit joys enticed;
 But she prevail'd not o'er the virtuous mind
 Discrete of whom she wooed; therefore a lie
 Framing, she royal Proetus thus bespake.
 Die thou, or slay Bellerophon, who sought
 Of late to force me to his lewd embrace.
 So saying, the anger of the King she roused.
 Slay him himself he would not, for his heart
 Forbad the deed; him therefore he dismiss'd
 To Lycia, charged with tales of dire import
 Written in tablets,[13] which he bade him show,
 That he might perish, to Anteia's sire.
 To Lycia then, conducted by the Gods,
 He went, and on the shores of Xanthus found
 Free entertainment noble at the hands
 Of Lycia's potent King. Nine days complete
 He feasted him, and slew each day an ox.
 But when the tenth day's ruddy morn appear'd,
 He asked him then his errand, and to see
 Those written tablets from his son-in-law.
 The letters seen, he bade him, first, destroy
 Chim�ra, deem'd invincible, divine
 In nature, alien from the race of man,
 Lion in front, but dragon all behind,
 And in the midst a she-goat breathing forth
 Profuse the violence of flaming fire.
 Her, confident in signs from heaven, he slew.
 Next, with the men of Solym�[14] he fought,
 Brave warriors far renown'd, with whom he waged,
 In his account, the fiercest of his wars.
 And lastly, when in battle he had slain
 The man-resisting Amazons, the king
 Another stratagem at his return
 Devised against him, placing close-conceal'd
 An ambush for him from the bravest chosen
 In Lycia; but they saw their homes no more;
 Bellerophon the valiant slew them all.
 The monarch hence collecting, at the last,
 His heavenly origin, him there detain'd,
 And gave him his own daughter, with the half
 Of all his royal dignity and power.
 The Lycians also, for his proper use,
 Large lot assigned him of their richest soil,[15]
 Commodious for the vine, or for the plow.
 And now his consort fair three children bore
 To bold Bellerophon; Isandrus one,
 And one, Hippolochus; his youngest born
 Laodamia was for beauty such
 That she became a concubine of Jove.
 She bore Sarpedon of heroic note.
 But when Bellerophon, at last, himself
 Had anger'd all the Gods, feeding on grief
 He roam'd alone the Aleian field, exiled,
 By choice, from every cheerful haunt of man.
 Mars, thirsty still for blood, his son destroy'd
 Isandrus, warring with the host renown'd
 Of Solym�; and in her wrath divine
 Diana from her chariot golden-rein'd
 Laodamia slew. Myself I boast
 Sprung from Hippolochus; he sent me forth
 To fight for Troy, charging me much and oft
 That I should outstrip always all mankind
 In worth and valor, nor the house disgrace
 Of my forefathers, heroes without peer
 In Ephyra, and in Lycia's wide domain.
 Such is my lineage; such the blood I boast.
 He ceased. Then valiant Diomede rejoiced.
 He pitch'd his spear, and to the Lycian Prince
 In terms of peace and amity replied.
 Thou art my own hereditary friend,
 Whose noble grandsire was the guest of mine.[16]
 For Oeneus, on a time, full twenty days
 Regaled Bellerophon, and pledges fair
 Of hospitality they interchanged.
 Oeneus a belt radiant with purple gave
 To brave Bellerophon, who in return
 Gave him a golden goblet. Coming forth
 I left the kind memorial safe at home.
 A child was I when Tydeus went to Thebes,
 Where the Achaians perish'd, and of him
 Hold no remembrance; but henceforth, my friend,
 Thine host am I in Argos, and thou mine
 In Lycia, should I chance to sojourn there.
 We will not clash. Trojans or aids of Troy
 No few the Gods shall furnish to my spear,
 Whom I may slaughter; and no want of Greeks
 On whom to prove thy prowess, thou shalt find.
 But it were well that an exchange ensued
 Between us; take mine armor, give me thine,
 That all who notice us may understand
 Our patrimonial[17] amity and love.
 So they, and each alighting, hand in hand
 Stood lock'd, faith promising and firm accord.
 Then Jove of sober judgment so bereft
 Infatuate Glaucus that with Tydeus' son
 He barter'd gold for brass, an hundred beeves
 In value, for the value small of nine.
 But Hector at the Sc�an gate and beech[18]
 Meantime arrived, to whose approach the wives
 And daughters flock'd of Troy, inquiring each
 The fate of husband, brother, son, or friend.
 He bade them all with solemn prayer the Gods
 Seek fervent, for that wo was on the wing.
 But when he enter'd Priam's palace, built
 With splendid porticoes, and which within
 Had fifty chambers lined with polish'd stone,
 Contiguous all, where Priam's sons reposed
 And his sons' wives, and where, on the other side.
 In twelve magnificent chambers also lined
 With polish'd marble and contiguous all,
 The sons-in-law of Priam lay beside
 His spotless daughters, there the mother queen
 Seeking the chamber of Laodice,
 Loveliest of all her children, as she went
 Met Hector. On his hand she hung and said:
 Why leavest thou, O my son! the dangerous field?
 I fear that the Achaians (hateful name!)
 Compass the walls so closely, that thou seek'st
 Urged by distress the citadel, to lift
 Thine hands in prayer to Jove? But pause awhile
 Till I shall bring thee wine, that having pour'd
 Libation rich to Jove and to the powers
 Immortal, thou may'st drink and be refresh'd.
 For wine is mighty to renew the strength
 Of weary man, and weary thou must be
 Thyself, thus long defending us and ours.
 To whom her son majestic thus replied.
 My mother, whom I reverence! cheering wine
 Bring none to me, lest I forget my might.[19]
 I fear, beside, with unwash'd hands to pour
 Libation forth of sable wine to Jove,
 And dare on none account, thus blood-defiled,[20]
 Approach the tempest-stirring God in prayer.
 Thou, therefore, gathering all our matrons, seek
 The fane of Pallas, huntress of the spoil,
 Bearing sweet incense; but from the attire
 Treasured within thy chamber, first select
 The amplest robe, most exquisitely wrought,
 And which thou prizest most--then spread the gift
 On Athen�an Pallas' lap divine.
 Twelve heifers also of the year, untouch'd
 With puncture of the goad, promise to slay
 In sacrifice, if she will pity Troy,
 Our wives and little ones, and will avert
 The son of Tydeus from these sacred towers,
 That dreadful Chief, terror of all our host.
 Go then, my mother, seek the hallowed fane
 Of the spoil-huntress Deity. I, the while,
 Seek Paris, and if Paris yet can hear,
 Shall call him forth. But oh that earth would yawn
 And swallow him, whom Jove hath made a curse
 To Troy, to Priam, and to all his house;
 Methinks, to see him plunged into the shades
 For ever, were a cure for all my woes.
 He ceased; the Queen, her palace entering, charged
 Her maidens; they, incontinent, throughout
 All Troy convened the matrons, as she bade.
 Meantime into her wardrobe incense-fumed,
 Herself descended; there her treasures lay,
 Works of Sidonian women,[21] whom her son
 The godlike Paris, when he cross'd the seas
 With Jove-begotten Helen, brought to Troy.
 The most magnificent, and varied most
 With colors radiant, from the rest she chose
 For Pallas; vivid as a star it shone,
 And lowest lay of all. Then forth she went,
 The Trojan matrons all following her steps.
 But when the long procession reach'd the fane
 Of Pallas in the heights of Troy, to them
 The fair Theano ope'd the portals wide,
 Daughter of Cisseus, brave Antenor's spouse,
 And by appointment public, at that time,
 Priestess of Pallas. All with lifted hands[22]
 In presence of Minerva wept aloud.
 Beauteous Theano on the Goddess' lap
 Then spread the robe, and to the daughter fair
 Of Jove omnipotent her suit address'd.
 Goddess[23] of Goddesses, our city's shield,
 Adored Minerva, hear! oh! break the lance
 Of Diomede, and give himself to fall
 Prone in the dust before the Sc�an gate.
 So will we offer to thee at thy shrine,
 This day twelve heifers of the year, untouch'd
 By yoke or goad, if thou wilt pity show
 To Troy, and save our children and our wives.
 Such prayer the priestess offer'd, and such prayer
 All present; whom Minerva heard averse.
 But Hector to the palace sped meantime
 Of Alexander, which himself had built,
 Aided by every architect of name
 Illustrious then in Troy. Chamber it had,
 Wide hall, proud dome, and on the heights of Troy
 Near-neighboring Hector's house and Priam's stood.
 There enter'd Hector, Jove-beloved, a spear
 Its length eleven cubits in his hand,
 Its glittering head bound with a ring of gold.
 He found within his chamber whom he sought,
 Polishing with exactest care his arms
 Resplendent, shield and hauberk fingering o'er
 With curious touch, and tampering with his bow.[24]
 Helen of Argos with her female train
 Sat occupied, the while, to each in turn
 Some splendid task assigning. Hector fix'd
 His eyes on Paris, and him stern rebuked.
 Thy sullen humors, Paris, are ill-timed.
 The people perish at our lofty walls;
 The flames of war have compass'd Troy around
 And thou hast kindled them; who yet thyself
 That slackness show'st which in another seen
 Thou would'st resent to death. Haste, seek the field
 This moment, lest, the next, all Ilium blaze.
 To whom thus Paris, graceful as a God.
 Since, Hector, thou hast charged me with a fault,
 And not unjustly, I will answer make,
 And give thou special heed. That here I sit,
 The cause is sorrow, which I wish'd to soothe
 In secret, not displeasure or revenge.
 I tell thee also, that even now my wife
 Was urgent with me in most soothing terms
 That I would forth to battle; and myself,
 Aware that victory oft changes sides,
 That course prefer. Wait, therefore, thou awhile,
 'Till I shall dress me for the fight, or go
 Thou first, and I will overtake thee soon.
 He ceased, to whom brave Hector answer none
 Return'd, when Helen him with lenient speech
 Accosted mild.[25] My brother! who in me
 Hast found a sister worthy of thy hate,
 Authoress of all calamity to Troy,
 Oh that the winds, the day when I was born,
 Had swept me out of sight, whirl'd me aloft
 To some inhospitable mountain-top,
 Or plunged me in the deep; there I had sunk
 O'erwhelm'd, and all these ills had never been.
 But since the Gods would bring these ills to pass,
 I should, at least, some worthier mate have chosen,
 One not insensible to public shame.
 But this, oh this, nor hath nor will acquire
 Hereafter, aught which like discretion shows
 Or reason, and shall find his just reward.
 But enter; take this seat; for who as thou
 Labors, or who hath cause like thee to rue
 The crime, my brother, for which Heaven hath doom'd
 Both Paris and my most detested self
 To be the burthens of an endless song?
 To whom the warlike Hector huge[26] replied.
 Me bid not, Helen, to a seat, howe'er
 Thou wish my stay, for thou must not prevail.
 The Trojans miss me, and myself no less
 Am anxious to return. But urge in haste
 This loiterer forth; yea, let him urge himself
 To overtake me ere I quit the town.
 For I must home in haste, that I may see
 My loved Andromache, my infant boy,
 And my domestics, ignorant if e'er
 I shall behold them more, or if my fate
 Ordain me now to fall by Grecian hands.
 So spake the dauntless hero, and withdrew.
 But reaching soon his own well-built abode
 He found not fair Andromache; she stood
 Lamenting Hector, with the nurse who bore
 Her infant, on a turret's top sublime.
 He then, not finding his chaste spouse within,
 Thus from the portal, of her train inquired.
 Tell me, ye maidens, whither went from home
 Andromache the fair?[27] Went she to see
 Her female kindred of my father's house,
 Or to Minerva's temple, where convened
 The bright-hair'd matrons of the city seek
 To soothe the awful Goddess? Tell me true.
 To whom his household's governess discreet.
 Since, Hector, truth is thy demand, receive
 True answer. Neither went she forth to see
 Her female kindred of thy father's house,
 Nor to Minerva's temple, where convened
 The bright-haired matrons of the city seek
 To soothe the awful Goddess; but she went
 Hence to the tower of Troy: for she had heard
 That the Achaians had prevail'd, and driven
 The Trojans to the walls; she, therefore, wild
 With grief, flew thither, and the nurse her steps
 Attended, with thy infant in her arms.
 So spake the prudent governess; whose words
 When Hector heard, issuing from his door
 He backward trod with hasty steps the streets
 Of lofty Troy, and having traversed all
 The spacious city, when he now approach'd
 The Sc�an gate, whence he must seek the field,
 There, hasting home again his noble wife
 Met him, Andromache the rich-endow'd
 Fair daughter of E�tion famed in arms.
 E�tion, who in Hypoplacian Thebes
 Umbrageous dwelt, Cilicia's mighty lord--
 His daughter valiant Hector had espoused.
 There she encounter'd him, and with herself
 The nurse came also, bearing in her arms
 Hectorides, his infant darling boy,
 Beautiful as a star. Him Hector called
 Scamandrios, but Astyanax[28] all else
 In Ilium named him, for that Hector's arm
 Alone was the defence and strength of Troy.
 The father, silent, eyed his babe, and smiled.
 Andromache, meantime, before him stood,
 With streaming cheeks, hung on his hand, and said.
 Thy own great courage will cut short thy days,
 My noble Hector! neither pitiest thou
 Thy helpless infant, or my hapless self,
 Whose widowhood is near; for thou wilt fall
 Ere long, assail'd by the whole host of Greece.
 Then let me to the tomb, my best retreat
 When thou art slain. For comfort none or joy
 Can I expect, thy day of life extinct,
 But thenceforth, sorrow. Father I have none;
 No mother. When Cilicia's city, Thebes
 The populous, was by Achilles sack'd.
 He slew my father; yet his gorgeous arms
 Stripp'd not through reverence of him, but consumed,
 Arm'd as it was, his body on the pile,
 And heap'd his tomb, which the Oreades,
 Jove's daughters, had with elms inclosed around.[29]
 My seven brothers, glory of our house,
 All in one day descended to the shades;
 For brave Achilles,[30] while they fed their herds
 And snowy flocks together, slew them all.
 My mother, Queen of the well-wooded realm
 Of Hypoplacian Thebes, her hither brought
 Among his other spoils, he loosed again
 At an inestimable ransom-price,
 But by Diana pierced, she died at home.
 Yet Hector--oh my husband! I in thee
 Find parents, brothers, all that I have lost.
 Come! have compassion on us. Go not hence,
 But guard this turret, lest of me thou make
 A widow, and an orphan of thy boy.
 The city walls are easiest of ascent
 At yonder fig-tree; station there thy powers;
 For whether by a prophet warn'd, or taught
 By search and observation, in that part
 Each Ajax with Idomeneus of Crete,
 The sons of Atreus, and the valiant son
 Of Tydeus, have now thrice assail'd the town.
 To whom the leader of the host of Troy.
 These cares, Andromache, which thee engage,
 All touch me also; but I dread to incur
 The scorn of male and female tongues in Troy,
 If, dastard-like, I should decline the fight.
 Nor feel I such a wish. No. I have learn'd
 To be courageous ever, in the van
 Among the flower of Ilium to assert
 My glorious father's honor, and my own.
 For that the day shall come when sacred Troy,
 When Priam, and the people of the old
 Spear-practised King shall perish, well I know.
 But for no Trojan sorrows yet to come
 So much I mourn, not e'en for Hecuba,
 Nor yet for Priam, nor for all the brave
 Of my own brothers who shall kiss the dust,
 As for thyself, when some Achaian Chief
 Shall have convey'd thee weeping hence, thy sun
 Of peace and liberty for ever set.
 Then shalt thou toil in Argos at the loom
 For a task-mistress, and constrain'd shalt draw
 From Hypere�a's fount,[31] or from the fount
 Messe�s, water at her proud command.
 Some Grecian then, seeing thy tears, shall say--
 "This was the wife of Hector, who excell'd
 All Troy in fight when Ilium was besieged."
 Such he shall speak thee, and thy heart, the while,
 Shall bleed afresh through want of such a friend
 To stand between captivity and thee.
 But may I rest beneath my hill of earth
 Or ere that day arrive! I would not live
 To hear thy cries, and see thee torn away.
 So saying, illustrious Hector stretch'd his arms
 Forth to his son, but with a scream, the child
 Fell back into the bosom of his nurse,
 His father's aspect dreading, whose bright arms
 He had attentive mark'd and shaggy crest
 Playing tremendous o'er his helmet's height.
 His father and his gentle mother laugh'd,[32]
 And noble Hector lifting from his head
 His dazzling helmet, placed it on the ground,
 Then kiss'd his boy and dandled him, and thus
 In earnest prayer the heavenly powers implored.
 Hear all ye Gods! as ye have given to me,
 So also on my son excelling might
 Bestow, with chief authority in Troy.
 And be his record this, in time to come,
 When he returns from battle. Lo! how far
 The son excels the sire! May every foe
 Fall under him, and he come laden home
 With spoils blood-stain'd to his dear mother's joy.
 He said, and gave his infant to the arms
 Of his Andromache, who him received
 Into her fragrant bosom, bitter tears
 With sweet smiles mingling; he with pity moved
 That sight observed, soft touch'd her cheek, and said,
 Mourn not, my loved Andromache, for me
 Too much; no man shall send me to the shades
 Of Tartarus, ere mine allotted hour,
 Nor lives he who can overpass the date
 By heaven assign'd him, be he base or brave.[33]
 Go then, and occupy content at home
 The woman's province; ply the distaff, spin
 And weave, and task thy maidens. War belongs
 To man; to all men; and of all who first
 Drew vital breath in Ilium, most to me.[34]
 He ceased, and from the ground his helmet raised
 Hair-crested; his Andromache, at once
 Obedient, to her home repair'd, but oft
 Turn'd as she went, and, turning, wept afresh.
 No sooner at the palace she arrived
 Of havoc-spreading Hector, than among
 Her numerous maidens found within, she raised
 A general lamentation; with one voice,
 In his own house, his whole domestic train
 Mourn'd Hector, yet alive; for none the hope
 Conceived of his escape from Grecian hands,
 Or to behold their living master more.
 Nor Paris in his stately mansion long
 Delay'd, but, arm'd resplendent, traversed swift
 The city, all alacrity and joy.
 As some stall'd horse high-fed, his stable-cord
 Snapt short, beats under foot the sounding plain,
 Accustomed in smooth-sliding streams to lave
 Exulting; high he bears his head, his mane
 Undulates o'er his shoulders, pleased he eyes
 His glossy sides, and borne on pliant knees
 Shoots to the meadow where his fellows graze;
 So Paris, son of Priam, from the heights
 Of Pergamus into the streets of Troy,
 All dazzling as the sun, descended, flush'd
 With martial pride, and bounding in his course.
 At once he came where noble Hector stood
 Now turning, after conference with his spouse,
 When godlike Alexander thus began.
 My hero brother, thou hast surely found
 My long delay most irksome. More dispatch
 Had pleased thee more, for such was thy command.
 To whom the warlike Hector thus replied.
 No man, judicious, and in feat of arms
 Intelligent, would pour contempt on thee
 (For thou art valiant) wert thou not remiss
 And wilful negligent; and when I hear
 The very men who labor in thy cause
 Reviling thee, I make thy shame my own.
 But let us on. All such complaints shall cease
 Hereafter, and thy faults be touch'd no more,
 Let Jove but once afford us riddance clear
 Of these Achaians, and to quaff the cup
 Of liberty, before the living Gods.

	It may be observed, that Hector begins to resume his hope of success, and his warlike spirit is roused again, as he approaches the field of action. The depressing effect of his sad interview is wearing away from his mind, and he is already prepared for the battle with Ajax, which awaits him.

	The student who has once read this book, will read it again and again. It contains much that is addressed to the deepest feelings of our common nature, and, despite of the long interval of time which lies between our age and the Homeric--despite the manifold changes of customs, habits, pursuits, and the advances that have been made in civilization and art--despite of all these, the universal spirit of humanity will recognize in these scenes much of that true poetry which delights alike all ages, all nations, all men.--FELTON.
