 Mary, I love to sing
 About the flowers of Spring,
 For they resemble thee.
 In the earliest of the year
 Thy beauties will appear,
 And youthful modesty.

 Here's the daisy's silver rim,
 With gold eye never dim,
 Spring's earliest flower so fair.
 Here the pilewort's golden rays
 Set the cow green in a blaze,
 Like the sunshine in thy hair.

 Here's forget-me-not so blue;
 Is there any flower so true?
 Can it speak my happy lot?
 When we courted in disguise
 This flower I used to prize,
 For it said "Forget-me-not."

 Speedwell! And when we meet
 In the meadow paths so sweet,
 Where the flowers I gave to thee
 All grew beneath the sun,
 May thy gentle heart be won,
 And I be blest with thee.
