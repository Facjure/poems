 When the walls were red
 That now are seen
 To be overspread
 With a mouldy green,
 A fresh fair head
 Would often lean
 From the sunny casement
 And scan the scene,
While blithely spoke the wind to the little sycamore tree.

 But storms have raged
 Those walls about,
 And the head has aged
 That once looked out;
 And zest is suaged
 And trust is doubt,
 And slow effacement
 Is rife throughout,
While fiercely girds the wind at the long-limbed sycamore tree!
