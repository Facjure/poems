�Give� and �It-shall-be-given-unto-you.�


I.
Grand rough old Martin Luther
Bloomed fables, flowers on furze,
The better the uncouther:
Do roses stick like burrs?

II.
A beggar asked an alms
One day at an abbey-door,
Said Luther; but, seized with qualms,
The abbot replied, �We�re poor!

III.
�Poor, who had plenty once,
�When gifts fell thick as rain:
�But they give us nought, for the nonce,
�And how should we give again?�

IV.
Then the beggar, �See your sins!
�Of old, unless I err,
�Ye had brothers for inmates, twins,
�Date and Dabitur.

V.
�While Date was in good case
�Dabitur flourished too:
�For Dabitur�s lenten face
�No wonder if Date rue.

VI.
�Would ye retrieve the one?
�Try and make plump the other!
�When Date�s penance is done,
�Dabitur helps his brother.

VII.
�Only, beware relapse!�
The Abbot hung his head.
This beggar might be perhaps
An angel, Luther said.
