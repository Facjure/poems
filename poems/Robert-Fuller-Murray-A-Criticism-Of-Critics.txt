title: A Criticism Of Critics
---

How often have the critics, trained
 To look upon the sky
Through telescopes securely chained,
 Forgot the naked eye.

Within the compass of their glass
 Each smallest star they knew,
And not a meteor could pass
 But they were looking through.

When a new planet shed its rays
 Beyond their field of vision,
And simple folk ran out to gaze,
 They laughed in high derision.

They railed upon the senseless throng
 Who cheered the brave new light.
And yet the learned men were wrong,
 The simple folk were right.
