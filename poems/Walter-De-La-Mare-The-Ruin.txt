 When the last colours of the day
 Have from their burning ebbed away,
 About that ruin, cold and lone,
 The cricket shrills from stone to stone;
 And scattering o'er its darkened green,
 Bands of the fairies may be seen,
 Chattering like grasshoppers, their feet
 Dancing a thistledown dance round it:
 While the great gold of the mild moon
 Tinges their tiny acorn shoon.
