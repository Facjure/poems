[1]

 As went the goat her pendent dugs to fill,
 And browse the herbage of a distant hill,
 She latch'd her door, and bid,
 With matron care, her kid; - 
 'My daughter, as you live,
 This portal don't undo
 To any creature who
 This watchword does not give:
 "Deuce take the wolf and all his race!"'
 The wolf was passing near the place
 By chance, and heard the words with pleasure,
 And laid them up as useful treasure;
 And hardly need we mention,
 Escaped the goat's attention.
 No sooner did he see
 The matron off, than he,
 With hypocritic tone and face,
 Cried out before the place,
 'Deuce take the wolf and all his race!'
 Not doubting thus to gain admission.
 The kid, not void of all suspicion,
 Peer'd through a crack, and cried,
 'Show me white paw before
 You ask me to undo the door.'
 The wolf could not, if he had died,
 For wolves have no connexion
 With paws of that complexion.
 So, much surprised, our gormandiser
 Retired to fast till he was wiser.
 How would the kid have been undone
 Had she but trusted to the word
 The wolf by chance had overheard!
 Two sureties better are than one;
 And caution's worth its cost,
 Though sometimes seeming lost.
