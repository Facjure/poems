title: More Fortunate

I hold that life more fortunate by far
 That sits with its sweet memories alone
 And cherishes a joy for ever flown
Beyond the reach of accident to mar.
(Some joy that was extinguished like a star)
 Than that which makes the prize so much its own
 That its poor commonplacenesses are shown;
(Which in all things, when viewed too closely, are.)

Better to mourn a blossom snatched away
 Before it reached perfection, than behold
With dry, unhappy eyes, day after day,
The fresh bloom fade, and the fair leaf decay.
 Better to lose the dream, with all its gold,
Than keep it till it changes to dull grey.
