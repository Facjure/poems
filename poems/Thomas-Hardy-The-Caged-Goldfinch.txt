title: The Caged Goldfinch
---

Within a churchyard, on a recent grave,
 I saw a little cage
That jailed a goldfinch. All was silence save
 Its hops from stage to stage.

There was inquiry in its wistful eye,
 And once it tried to sing;
Of him or her who placed it there, and why,
 No one knew anything.
