 Can I find True-Love a gift
 In this dark hour to restore her,
 When body's vessel breaks adrift,
 When hope and beauty fade before her?
 But in this plight I cannot think
 Of song or music, that would grieve her,
 Or toys or meat or snow-cooled drink;
 Not this way can her sadness leave her.
 She lies and frets in childish fever,
 All I can do is but to cry
 "Sleep, sleep, True-Love and lullaby!"

 Lullaby, and sleep again.
 Two bright eyes through the window stare,
 A nose is flattened on the pane
 And infant fingers fumble there.
 "Not yet, not yet, you lovely thing,
 But count and come nine weeks from now,
 When winter's tail has lost the sting,
 When buds come striking through the bough,
 Then here's True-Love will show you how
 Her name she won, will hush your cry
 With "Sleep, my baby!Lullaby!"
