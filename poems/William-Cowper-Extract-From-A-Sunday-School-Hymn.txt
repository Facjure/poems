Hear, Lord, the song of praise and prayer,
In heaven thy dwelling-place,
From infants, made the public care,
And taught to seek thy face!


Thanks for thy Word, and for thy day,
And grant us, we implore,
Never to waste in sinful play
Thy holy Sabbaths more.


Thanks that we hearï¿½but, oh! impart
To each desires sincere,
That we may listen with our heart,
And learn as well as hear.
