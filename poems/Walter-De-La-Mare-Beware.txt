 An ominous bird sang from its branch,
'Beware, O Wanderer!
 Night 'mid her flowers of glamourie spilled
Draws swiftly near:

 'Night with her darkened caravans,
Piled deep with silver and myrrh,
 Draws from the portals of the East,
O Wanderer near!

 'Night who walks plumï¿½d through the fields
Of stars that strangely stir - 
 Smitten to fire by the sandals of him
Who walks with her.'
