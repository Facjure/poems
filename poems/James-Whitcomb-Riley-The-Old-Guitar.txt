Neglected now is the old guitar
 And moldering into decay;
Fretted with many a rift and scar
 That the dull dust hides away,
While the spider spins a silver star
 In its silent lips to-day.

The keys hold only nerveless strings -
 The sinews of brave old airs
Are pulseless now; and the scarf that clings
 So closely here declares
A sad regret in its ravelings
 And the faded hue it wears.

But the old guitar, with a lenient grace,
 Has cherished a smile for me;
And its features hint of a fairer face
 That comes with a memory
Of a flower-and-perfume-haunted place
 And a moonlit balcony.

Music sweeter than words confess
 Or the minstrel's powers invent,
Thrilled here once at the light caress
 Of the fairy hands that lent
This excuse for the kiss I press
 On the dear old instrument.

The rose of pearl with the jeweled stem
 Still blooms; and the tiny sets
In the circle all are here; the gem
 In the keys, and the silver frets;
But the dainty fingers that danced o'er them -
 Alas for the heart's regrets! -

Alas for the loosened strings to-day,
 And the wounds of rift and scar
On a worn old heart, with its roundelay
 Enthralled with a stronger bar
That Fate weaves on, through a dull decay
 Like that of the old guitar!
