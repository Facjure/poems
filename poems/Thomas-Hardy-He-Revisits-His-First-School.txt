title: He Revisits His First School

I should not have shown in the flesh,
I ought to have gone as a ghost;
It was awkward, unseemly almost,
Standing solidly there as when fresh,
 Pink, tiny, crisp-curled,
 My pinions yet furled
 From the winds of the world.

After waiting so many a year
To wait longer, and go as a sprite
From the tomb at the mid of some night
Was the right, radiant way to appear;
 Not as one wanzing weak
 From life's roar and reek,
 His rest still to seek:

Yea, beglimpsed through the quaint quarried glass
Of green moonlight, by me greener made,
When they'd cry, perhaps, "There sits his shade
In his olden haunt - just as he was
 When in Walkingame he
 Conned the grand Rule-of-Three
 With the bent of a bee."

But to show in the afternoon sun,
With an aspect of hollow-eyed care,
When none wished to see me come there,
Was a garish thing, better undone.
 Yes; wrong was the way;
 But yet, let me say,
 I may right it - some day.
