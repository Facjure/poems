title: I'll Dream Upon The Days To Come
---

 I'll lay me down on the green sward,
 Mid yellowcups and speedwell blue,
 And pay the world no more regard,
 But be to Nature leal and true.
 Who break the peace of hapless man
 But they who Truth and Nature wrong?
 I'll hear no more of evil's plan,
 But live with Nature and her song.

 Where Nature's lights and shades are green,
 Where Nature's place is strewn with flowers.
 Where strife and care are never seen,
 There I'll retire to happy hours,
 And stretch my body on the green,
 And sleep among the flowers in bloom,
 By eyes of malice seldom seen,
 And dream upon the days to come.

 I'll lay me by the forest green,
 I'll lay me on the pleasant grass;
 My life shall pass away unseen;
 I'll be no more the man I was.
 The tawny bee upon the flower,
 The butterfly upon the leaf,
 Like them I'll live my happy hour,
 A life of sunshine, bright and brief.

 In greenwood hedges, close at hand,
 Build, brood, and sing the little birds,
 The happiest things in the green land,
 While sweetly feed the lowing herds,
 While softly bleat the roving sheep.
 Upon the green grass will I lie,
 A Summer's day, to think and sleep.
 Or see the clouds sail down the sky.
