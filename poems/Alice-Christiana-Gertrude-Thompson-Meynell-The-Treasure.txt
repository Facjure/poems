 Three times have I beheld
 Fear leap in a babe�s face, and take his breath,
 Fear, like the fear of eld
 That knows the price of life, the name of death.

 What is it justifies
 This thing, this dread, this fright that has no tongue,
 The terror in those eyes
 When only eyes can speak-they are so young?

 Not yet those eyes had wept.
 What does fear cherish that it locks so well?
 What fortress is thus kept?
 Of what is ignorant terror sentinel?

 And pain in the poor child,
 Monstrously disproportionate, and dumb
 In the poor beast, and wild
 In the old decorous man, caught, overcome?

 Of what the outposts these?
 Of what the fighting guardians?What demands
 That sense of menaces,
 And then such flying feet, imploring hands?

 Life: There�s nought else to seek;
 Life only, little prized; but by design
 Of Nature prized.How weak,
 How sad, how brief!O how divine, divine!
