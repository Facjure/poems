title: Life Laughs Onward

Rambling I looked for an old abode
Where, years back, one had lived I knew;
Its site a dwelling duly showed,
 But it was new.

I went where, not so long ago,
The sod had riven two breasts asunder;
Daisies throve gaily there, as though
 No grave were under.

I walked along a terrace where
Loud children gambolled in the sun;
The figure that had once sat there
 Was missed by none.

Life laughed and moved on unsubdued,
I saw that Old succumbed to Young:
'Twas well. My too regretful mood
 Died on my tongue.
