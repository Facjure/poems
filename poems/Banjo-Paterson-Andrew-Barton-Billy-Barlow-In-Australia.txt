When I was at home I was down on my luck,
And I earned a poor living by drawing a truck;
But old aunt died, and left me a thousand��Oh, oh,
I�ll start on my travels,� said Billy Barlow.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
So off to Australia came Billy Barlow.

When to Sydney I got, there a merchant I met,
Who said he would teach me a fortune to get;
He�d cattle and sheep past the colony�s bounds,
Which he sold with the station for my thousand pounds.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
He gammon�d the cash out of Billy Barlow.

When the bargain was struck, and the money was paid,
He said, �My dear fellow, your fortune is made;
I can furnish supplies for the station, you know,
And your bill is sufficient, good Mr. Barlow.�
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
A gentleman settler was Billy Barlow.

So I got my supplies, and I gave him my bill,
And for New England started, my pockets to fill;
But by bushrangers met, with my traps they made free,
Took my horse and left Billy bailed to a tree.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
�I shall die of starvation,� thought Billy Barlow.


At last I got loose, and I walked on my way;
A constable came up, and to me did say,
�Are you free?� Says I, �Yes, to be sure; don�t you know?�
And I handed my card, �Mr. William Barlow.�
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
He said, �That�s all gammon,� to Billy Barlow.

Then he put on the handcuffs, and brought me away
Right back down to Maitland, before Mr. Day.
When I said I was free, why the J.P. replied,
�I must send you down to be i�dentified.�
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
So to Sydney once more went poor Billy Barlow.

They at last let me go, and I then did repair
For my station once more, and at length I got there;
But a few days before, the blacks, you must know,
Had spear�d all the cattle of Billy Barlow.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
�It�s a beautiful country,� said Billy Barlow.

And for nine months before no rain there had been,
So the devil a blade of grass could be seen;
And one-third of my wethers the scab they had got,
And the other two-thirds had just died of the rot.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
�I shall soon be a settler,� said Billy Barlow.

And the matter to mend, now my bill was near due,
So I wrote to my friend, and just asked to renew;
He replied he was sorry he couldn�t, because
The bill had passed into a usurer�s claws.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
�But perhaps he�ll renew it,� said Billy Barlow.

I applied; to renew he was quite content,
If secured, and allowed just three hundred per cent.;
But as I couldn�t do, Barr, Rodgers, and Co.
Soon sent up a summons for Billy Barlow.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
They soon settled the business of Billy Barlow.

For a month or six weeks I stewed over my loss,
And a tall man rode up one day on a black horse;
He asked, �Don�t you know me?� I answered him �No.�
�Why,� said he, �my name�s Kinsmill; how are you, Barlow?�
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
He�d got a fi. fa. for poor Billy Barlow.

What I�d left of my sheep and my traps he did seize,
And he said, �They won�t pay all the costs and my fees;�
Then he sold off the lot, and I�m sure �twas a sin,
At sixpence a head, and the station giv�n in.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
�I�ll go back to England,� said Billy Barlow.

My sheep being sold, and my money all gone,
Oh, I wandered about then quite sad and forlorn;
How I managed to live it would shock you to know,
And as thin as a lath got poor Billy Barlow.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
Quite down on his luck was poor Billy Barlow.

And in a few weeks more, the sheriff, you see,
Sent the tall man on horseback once more unto me;
Having got all he could by the writ of fi. fa.,
By way of a change he�d brought up a ca. sa.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
He seized on the body of Billy Barlow.

He took me to Sydney, and there they did lock
Poor unfortunate Billy fast �under the clock;�
And to get myself out I was forced, you must know
The schedule to file of poor Billy Barlow.
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
In the list of insolvents was Billy Barlow.

Then once more I got free, but in poverty�s toil;
I�ve no �cattle for salting,� no �sheep for to boil;�
I can�t get a job�though to any I�d stoop,
If it was only the making of portable soup.�
Oh dear, lackaday, oh,
Pray give some employment to Billy Barlow.
