What magic shall solve us the secret
 Of beauty that's born for an hour?
That gleams like the flight of an egret,
 Or burns like the scent of a flower,
 With death for a dower?

What leaps in the bosk but a satyr?
 What pipes on the wind but a faun?
Or laughs in the waters that scatter,
 But limbs of a nymph who is gone,
 When we walk in the dawn?

What sings on the hills but a fairy?
 Or sighs in the fields but a sprite?
What breathes through the leaves but the airy
 Soft spirits of shadow and light,
 When we walk in the night?

Behold how the world-heart is eager
 To draw us and hold us and claim!
Through truths of the dreams that beleaguer
 Her soul she makes ours the same,
 And death but a name.
