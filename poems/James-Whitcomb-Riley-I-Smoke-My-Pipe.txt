title: I Smoke My Pipe
---

 I can't extend to every friend
In need a helping hand -
 No matter though I wish it so,
'Tis not as Fortune planned;
 But haply may I fancy they
Are men of different stripe
 Than others think who hint and wink, -
And so - I smoke my pipe!

 A golden coal to crown the bowl -
My pipe and I alone, -
 I sit and muse with idler views
Perchance than I should own: -
 It might be worse to own the purse
Whose glutted bowels gripe
 In little qualms of stinted alms;
And so I smoke my pipe.

 And if inclined to moor my mind
And cast the anchor Hope,
 A puff of breath will put to death
The morbid misanthrope
 That lurks inside - as errors hide
In standing forms of type
 To mar at birth some line of worth;
And so I smoke my pipe.

 The subtle stings misfortune flings
Can give me little pain
 When my narcotic spell has wrought
This quiet in my brain:
 When I can waste the past in taste
So luscious and so ripe
 That like an elf I hug myself;
And so I smoke my pipe.

 And wrapped in shrouds of drifting clouds
I watch the phantom's flight,
 Till alien eyes from Paradise
Smile on me as I write:
 And I forgive the wrongs that live,
As lightly as I wipe
 Away the tear that rises here;
And so I smoke my pipe.
