Aw'm turned o' sixty, nah, old lass,
Yet weel aw mind the time,
When like a young horse turned to grass,
Aw gloried i' mi prime.
Aw'st ne'er forget that bonny face
'At stole mi heart away;
Tho' years have hurried on apace: - 
Aw'm sixty, turned, to-day.

We had some jolly pranks an gams,
E'en fifty year ago,
When sportive as a pair o' lambs,
We nivver dreeamed ov woe.
When ivvery morn we left us bed,
Wi' spirits leet an gay, - 
But nah, old lass, those days have fled: - 
Aw'm sixty, turned, to-day.

Yet we've noa reason to repine,
Or luk back wi' regret;
Those youthful days ov thine an mine,
Live sweet in mem'ry yet.
Thy winnin smile aw still can see,
An tho' thi hair's turned grey;
Tha'rt still as sweet an dear to me,
Tho' sixty, turned, to-day.

We've troubles had, an sickness too,
But then in spite ov all,
We've somha managed to pool throo,
Whativver might befall.
Awr pleasurs far outweighed the pain
We've met along life's way;
An losses past aw caant as gain, - 
When sixty, turned, to-day.

Awr childer nah are wed an gooan,
To mak hooams for thersels;
But we shall nivver feel alooan,
Wol love within us dwells.
We're drawin near awr journey's end,
We can't much longer stay;
Yet still awr hearts together blend,
Tho' sixty, turned, to-day.

Then let us humbly bow the knee,
To Him, whose wondrous love,
Has helpt an guided thee an me,
On th' pathway to above.
His mercies we will ne'er forget,
Then let us praise an pray,
To Him whose wings protect us yet;
Tho' sixty, turned, to-day.
