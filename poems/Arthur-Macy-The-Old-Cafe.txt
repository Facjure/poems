 You know,
 Don't you, Joe,
 Those merry evenings long ago?
 You know the room, the narrow stair,
 The wreaths of smoke that circled there,
 The corner table where we sat
 For hours in after-dinner chat,
 And magnified
 Our little world inside.
 You know,
 Don't you, Joe?

 Ah, those nights divine!
 The simple, frugal wine,
 The airs on crude Italian strings,
 The joyous, harmless revelings,
 Just fit for us - or kings!
 At times a quaint and wickered flask
 Of rare Chianti, or from the homelier cask
 Of modest Pilsener a stein or so,
 Amid the merry talk would flow;
 Or red Bordeaux
 From vines that grew where dear Montaigne
 Held his domain.
 And you remember that dark eye,
 None too shy;
 In fact, she seemed a bit too free
 For you and me.
 You know,
 Don't you, Joe?

 Then Pegasus I knew,
 And then I read to you
 My callow rhymes
 So many, many times;
 And something in the place
 Lent them a certain grace,
 Until I scarce believed them mine,
 Under the magic of the wine;
 But now I read them o'er,
 And see grave faults I had not seen before,
 And wonder how
 You could have listened with such placid brow,
 And somehow apprehend
 You sank the critic in the friend.
 You know,
 Don't you, Joe?

 And when we talked of books,
 How learned were our looks!
 And few the bards we could not quote,
 From gay Catullus' lines to Milton's purer note.
 Mayhap we now are wiser men,
 But we knew more than all the scholars then;
 And our conceit
 Was grand, ineffable, complete!
 We know,
 Don't we, Joe?

 Gone are those golden nights
 Of innocent Bohemian delights,
 And we are getting on;
 And anon,
 Years sad and tremulous
 May be in store for us;
 But should we ever meet
 Upon some quiet street,
 And you discover in an old man's eye
 Some transient sparkle of the days gone by,
 Then you will guess, perchance,
 The meaning of the glance;
 You'll know,
 Won't you, Joe?
