[1]

 In such a world, all men, of every grade,
 Should each the other kindly aid;
 For, if beneath misfortune's goad
 A neighbour falls, on you will fall his load.

 There jogg'd in company an ass and horse;
 Nought but his harness did the last endorse;
 The other bore a load that crush'd him down,
 And begg'd the horse a little help to give,
 Or otherwise he could not reach the town.
 'This prayer,' said he, 'is civil, I believe;
 One half this burden you would scarcely feel.'
 The horse refused, flung up a scornful heel,
 And saw his comrade die beneath the weight: - 
 And saw his wrong too late;
 For on his own proud back
 They put the ass's pack,
 And over that, beside,
 They put the ass's hide.
