title: East And West

In the bare midst of Anglesey they show
Two springs which close by one another play,
And, �Thirteen hundred years agone,� they say,
�Two saints met often where those waters flow.

�One came from Penmon, westward, and a glow
�Whiten�d his face from the sun�s fronting ray.
�Eastward the other, from the dying day;
�And he with unsunn�d face did always go.�

Seiriol the Bright, Kybi the Dark, men said.
The Se�r from the East was then in light,
The Se�r from the West was then in shade.

Ah! now �tis changed. In conquering sunshine bright
The man of the bold West now comes array�d;
He of the mystic East is touch�d with night.
