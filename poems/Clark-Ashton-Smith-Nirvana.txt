Poised as a god whose lone, detachï¿½d post,
 An eyrie, pends between the boundary-marks
 Of finite years, and those unvaried darks
That veil Eternity, I saw the host
Of worlds and suns, swept from the furthermost
 Of night - confusion as of dust with sparks -
 Whirl tow'rd the opposing brink; as one who harks
Some warning trumpet, Time, a withered ghost,
Fled with them; disunited orbs that late
 Were atoms of the universal frame,
They passed to some eternal fragment-heap.
And, lo, the gods, from space discorporate,
 Who were its life and vital spirit, came,
Drawn outward by the vampire-lips of Sleep!
