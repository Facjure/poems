title: Trouble On The Selection

You lazy boy, you�re here at last,
You must be wooden-legged;
Now, are you sure the gate is fast
And all the sliprails pegged
And all the milkers at the yard,
The calves all in the pen?
We don�t want Poley�s calf to suck
His mother dry again.

And did you mend the broken rail
And make it firm and neat?
I s�pose you want that brindle steer
All night among the wheat.
And if he finds the lucerne patch,
He�ll stuff his belly full;
He�ll eat till he gets �blown� on that
And busts like Ryan�s bull.

Old Spot is lost? You�ll drive me mad,
You will, upon my soul!
She might be in the boggy swamps
Or down a digger�s hole.
You needn�t talk, you never looked
You�d find her if you�d choose,
Instead of poking �possum logs
And hunting kangaroos.

How came your boots as wet as muck?
You tried to drown the ants!
Why don�t you take your bluchers off,
Good Lord, he�s tore his pants!
Your father�s coming home to-night;
You�ll catch it hot, you�ll see.
Now go and wash your filthy face
And come and get your tea.
