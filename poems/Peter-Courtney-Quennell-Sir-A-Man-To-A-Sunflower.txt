See, I have bent thee by thy saffron hair
O most strange masker, 
Towards my face, thy face so full of eyes
O almost legendary monster, 
Thee of the saffron, circling hair I bend,
Bend by my fingers knotted in thy hair
Hair like broad flames.
So, shall I swear by beech-husk, spindleberry,
To break thee, saffron hair and peering eye,
To have the mastery?
