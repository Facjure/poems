Where to-day would a dainty buyer
Imbibe your scented juice,
Pale ruin with a heart of fire;
Drain your succulence with her lips,
Grown sapless from much use...
Make minister of her desire
A chalice cup where no bee sips - 
 Where no wasp wanders in?

Close to her white flesh housed an hour,
 One held you... her spent form
Drew on yours for its wasted dower - 
What favour could she do you more?
 Yet, of all who drink therein,
 None know it is the warm
Odorous heart of a ravished flower
Tingles so in her mouth's red core...
