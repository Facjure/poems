 I cannot touch the harp again,
 And sing another idle lay,
 To cool a maddening, burning brain,
 And drive the midnight fiend away.
 Music, own sister to the soul.
 Bids roses bloom on cheeks all pale;
 And sweet her joys and sorrows roll
 When sings the Swedish Nightingale.

 I cannot touch the harp again;
 No chords will vibrate on the string;
 Like broken flowers upon the plain,
 My heart e'en withers while I sing.
 Aeolian harps have witching tones,
 On morning or the evening gale;
 No melody their music owns
 As sings the Swedish nightingale.
