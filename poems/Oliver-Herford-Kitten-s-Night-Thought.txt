---

When Human Folk put out the light,
 And think they've made it dark as night,
A Pussy Cat sees every bit
 As well as when the lights are lit.

When Human Folk have gone upstairs,
 And shed their skins and said their prayers,
And there is no one to annoy,
 Then Pussy may her life enjoy.

No Human hands to pinch or slap,
 Or rub her fur against the nap,
Or throw cold water from a pail,
 Or make a handle of her tail.

And so you will not think it wrong
 When she can play the whole night long,
With no one to disturb her play,
 That Pussy goes to bed by day.
