Long fed on boundless hopes, O race of man,
How angrily thou spurn�st all simpler fare!
Christ, some one says, was human as we are;
No judge eyes us from heaven, our sin to scan;

We live no more, when we have done our span.
�Well, then, for Christ,� thou answerest, �who can care?
�From sin, which heaven records not, why forbear
�Live we like brutes our life without a plan!�

So answerest thou; but why not rather say
Hath man no second life? Pitch this one high!
�Sits there no judge in heaven, our sin to see?

�More strictly, then, the inward judge obey!
�Was Christ a man like us? Ah! let us try
�If we then, too, can be such men as he!�
