 His daily, nightly task is o'er -
 He leans above his desk no more.

 His pencil and his pen say not
 One further word of gracious thought.

 All silent is his voice, yet clear
 For all a grateful world to hear;

 He poured abroad his human love
 In opulence unmeasured of -

 While, in return, his meek demand, -
 The warm clasp of a neighbor-hand

 In recognition of the true
 World's duty that he lived to do.

 So was he kin of yours and mine -
 So, even by the hallowed sign

 Of silence which he listens to,
 He hears our tears as falls the dew.
