By W--ll--m C--wp--r.

'Tis evening.See with its resorting throng
 Rude Carfax teems, and waistcoats, visited
 With too-familiar elbow, swell the curse
 Vortiginous.The boating man returns,
 His rawness growing with experience--
 Strange union! and directs the optic glass
 Not unresponsive to Jemima's charms,
 Who wheels obdurate, in his mimic chaise
 Perambulant, the child.The gouty cit,
 Asthmatical, with elevated cane
 Pursues the unregarding tram, as one
 Who, having heard a hurdy-gurdy, girds
 His loins and hunts the hurdy-gurdy-man,
 Blaspheming.Now the clangorous bell proclaims
 The Times or Chronicle, and Rauca screams
 The latest horrid murder in the ear
 Of nervous dons expectant of the urn
 And mild domestic muffin.
 To the Parks
 Drags the slow Ladies' School, consuming time
 In passing given points.Here glow the lamps,
 And tea-spoons clatter to the cosy hum
 Of scientific circles.Here resounds
 The football-field with its discordant train,
 The crowd that cheers but not discriminates,
 As ever into touch the ball returns
 And shrieks the whistle, while the game proceeds
 With fine irregularity well worth
 The paltry shilling.--
 Draw the curtains close
 While I resume the night-cap dear to all
 Familiar with my illustrated works.
