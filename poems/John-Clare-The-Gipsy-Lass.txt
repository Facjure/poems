title: The Gipsy Lass
---

 Just like the berry brown is my bonny lassie O!
 And in the smoky camp lives my bonny lassie O!
 Where the scented woodbine weaves
 Round the white-thorn's glossy leaves:
 The sweetest maid on earth is my gipsy lassie O!

 The brook it runs so clear by my bonny lassie O!
 And the blackbird singeth near my bonny lassie O!
 And there the wild briar rose
 Wrinkles the clear stream as it flows
 By the smoky camp of my bonny lassie O!

 The groundlark singeth high o'er my bonny lassie O!
 The nightingale lives nigh my gipsy lassie O!
 They're with her all the year,
 By the brook that runs so clear,
 And there's none in all the world like my gipsy lassie O!

 With a bosom white as snow is my gipsy lassie O!
 With a foot like to the roe is my bonny lassie O!
 Like the sweet birds she will sing,
 While echo it will ring:
 Sure there's none in the world like my bonny lassie O!
