I love this age of energy and force,
 Expectantly I greet each pregnant hour;
Emerging from the all-creative source,
 Supreme with promise, imminent with power.
The strident whistle and the clanging bell,
 The noise of gongs, the rush of motored things
Are but the prophet voices which foretell
 A time when thought may use unfettered wings.

Too long the drudgery of earth has been
 A barrier 'twixt man and his own mind.
Remove the stone, and lo! the Christ within;
 For He is there, and who so seeks shall find.
The Great Inventor is the Modern Priest.
 He paves the pathway to a higher goal.
Once from the grind of endless toil released
 Man will explore the kingdom of his soul.

And all this restless rush, this strain and strife,
 This noise and glare is but the fanfarade
That ushers in the more majestic life
 Where faith shall walk with science, unafraid.
I feel the strong vibrations of the earth,
 I sense the coming of an hour sublime,
And bless the star that watched above my birth
 And let me live in this important time.
