I rose, and idly sauntered to the pane,
 And on the March-bleak mountain bent my look;
 And standing there a sad review I took
Of what the day had brought me. What the gain
To Wisdom's store? What holds had Knowledge ta'en?
 I mused upon the lightly-handled book,
 The erring thought, and felt a stern rebuke:
"Alas, alas! the day hath been in vain!"

But as I gazed upon the upper blue,
 With many a twining jasper ridge up-ploughed,
Sudden, up-soaring, swung upon my view
 A molten, rolling, sunset-laden cloud:
My spirit stood, and caught its glorious hue -
 "Not lost the day!" it, leaping, cried aloud.
