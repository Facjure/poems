title: Flash Jack From Gundagai

I�ve shore at Burrabogie, and I�ve shore at Toganmain,
I�ve shore at big Willandra and upon the old Coleraine,
But before the shearin� was over I�ve wished myself back, again
Shearin� for old Tom Patterson, on the One Tree Plain.

Chorus

All among the wool, boys,
Keep your wide blades full, boys,
I can do a respectable tally myself whenever I like to try,
But they know me round the back blocks as Flash Jack from Gundagai.

I�ve shore at big Willandra and I�ve shore at Tilberoo,
And once I drew my blades, my boys, upon the famed Barcoo,
At Cowan Downs and Trida, as far as Moulamein,
But I always was glad to get back again to the One Tree Plain.

Chorus: All among the wool, &amp;c.

I�ve pinked �em with the Wolseleys and I�ve rushed with B-bows, too,
And shaved �em in the grease, my boys, with the grass seed showing through.
But I never slummed my pen, my lads, whate�er it might contain,
While shearin� for old Tom Patterson, on the One Tree Plain.

I�ve been whalin� up the Lachlan, and I�ve dossed on Cooper�s Creek,
And once I rung Cudjingie shed, and blued it in a week.
But when Gabriel blows his trumpet, lads, I�ll catch the morning train,
And I�ll push for old Tom Patterson�s, on the One Tree Plain.
