 When the spring comes round, and a certain day
Looks out from the brume by the eastern copsetrees
 And says, Remember,
I begin again, as if it were new,
A day of like date I once lived through,
Whiling it hour by hour away;
 So shall I do till my December,
 When spring comes round.

 I take my holiday then and my rest
Away from the dun life here about me,
 Old hours re-greeting
With the quiet sense that bring they must
Such throbs as at first, till I house with dust,
And in the numbness my heartsome zest
 For things that were, be past repeating
 When spring comes round.
