You have two ears--and but one mouth:
 Let this, friend, be a token--
Much should be heard, and not so much
 Be spoken.

You have two eyes--and but one mouth:
 That is an indication--
Much must you see, but little serves
 Relation.

You have two hands--and but one mouth:
 Receive the hint you meet with--
For labour two, but only one
 To eat with.
