I
 I seem to be
 Sundered from Thee,
Thou Harmony of all creation.
 Am I disowned
 For talents loaned
And useless hid in vain probation?
 Now powerless,
 In weariness,
Now in despair a beggar humble
 For help, for cheer,
 A voice, an ear,
To hear and guide, while on I stumble.
 God, let me be.
 Of use to Thee!
If vain my purpose and my powers,
 Then sinks from sight
 My star, - and night
Henceforth my steps enfolding lowers.
 Then break and bind
 My ravaged mind
The terrors dread of doubt and anguish.
 I know the pack,
 I drove them back; - 
Only to-day does courage languish.
 Oh, come now, peace!
 Come faith's increase,
That life's strong chain shall ever bind me!
 That not in vain
 I strive and strain
Myself to seek until I find me!


II
Honor the springtide life ever adorning,
 That all things has made!
Things smallest have some resurrectional morning,
 The forms alone fade.
 Life begets life,
Potencies higher surprise.
 Kind begets kind,
Heedless of time as it flies.
Worlds pass away and arise.

Nothing so small but there's something still smaller,
 No one can see.
Nothing so great but there's something still greater
 Beyond it can be.
 Worms in the earth - 
Mountains to make they essay.
 Dust without worth,
Sands with which sea-billows play, - 
Founders of kingdoms were they.

Infinite all, where the smallest and greatest
 Oneness unfold.
No one has seen what was first, - and the latest
 None shall behold.
 Laws underlie,
Order the all they maintain.
 Need and supply
Bring one another; our bane
Boots to the general gain.

Eternity's offspring and germ are we all now.
 Thoughts have their true
Roots in our race's first morning; they fall now,
 Query and clue,
 Freighted with seed
Into eternity's soil;
 Joy be your meed,
That your brief life's fleeting toil
Fruit for eternity bears.

Join in the joy of all life, every being,
 Brief bloom of its spring!
Honor th' eternal, our human lot freeing
 From fetters that cling!
 Adding your mite,
With the eternal unite!
 Though you decay,
Breathe as a moment you may,
Air of eternity's day!


III

CHORUS

Who art Thou, whom a thousand names trace
Through all times that are gone and each tongue?
Thou wert infinite yearning's embrace,
Thou wert hope when the yoke heavy hung,
Thou wert darkening death-terror's guest,
Thou wert sun that with life-gladness blessed.
Still Thine image we changefully fashion,
And each form we would call revelation;
Each man holds his for true with deep passion, - 
Till it crumbles in poignant negation.


SOLO

Who Thou art, none can tell.
But I know Thou dost dwell
As the limitless search in my soul - it is Thou! - 
After justice and light,
After victory's right
For the new that's revealed, it is Thou, it is Thou!
Every law that we see
Or believe there may be,
Though we never can knowledge attain, it is Thou! - 
As my armor and aid
Round my life they are laid,
And with joy I avow, it is Thou, it is Thou!


CHORUS

Since we never Thine essence can know,
We have thought mediators of Thee; - 
But the ages their impotence show,
We stand still, while no way we can see.
If in sickness for succor we thirst,
Is there balm in the dreams that have burst?
Stars of hope and of longing eternal,
That we saw o'er life's sorrows arisen,
Shall they sink in death's terrors nocturnal,
Only turn into worms in our prison?


SOLO
He that liveth in me,
Needeth no one to be
Mediator; I own Him indeed: it is Thou!
Is eternal hope prized
As from Him; is baptized
By His spirit my own, - is it Thou, is it Thou - :
Shall not I, who am dust,
His eternity trust?
I take humbly my law; for I know, it is Thou!
Was I worth Thy word: Live!
Let Thy life power give,
When Thou wilt, as Thou wilt, - it is Thou, it is Thou!
