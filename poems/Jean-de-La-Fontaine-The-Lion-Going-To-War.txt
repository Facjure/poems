[1]

 The lion had an enterprise in hand;
 Held a war-council, sent his provost-marshal,
 And gave the animals a call impartial - 
 Each, in his way, to serve his high command.
 The elephant should carry on his back
 The tools of war, the mighty public pack,
 And fight in elephantine way and form;
 The bear should hold himself prepared to storm;
 The fox all secret stratagems should fix;
 The monkey should amuse the foe by tricks.
 'Dismiss,' said one, 'the blockhead asses,
 And hares, too cowardly and fleet.'
 'No,' said the king; 'I use all classes;
 Without their aid my force were incomplete.
 The ass shall be our trumpeter, to scare
 Our enemy. And then the nimble hare
 Our royal bulletins shall homeward bear.'

 A monarch provident and wise
 Will hold his subjects all of consequence,
 And know in each what talent lies.
 There's nothing useless to a man of sense.
