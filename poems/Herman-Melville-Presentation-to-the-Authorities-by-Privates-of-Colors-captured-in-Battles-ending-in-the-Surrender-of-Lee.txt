title: Presentation to the Authorities, by Privates, of Colors captured in Battles ending in the Surrender of Lee.

 These flags of armies overthrown - 
 Flags fallen beneath the sovereign one
 In end foredoomed which closes war;
 We here, the captors, lay before
 The altar which of right claims all - 
 Our Country. And as freely we,
 Revering ever her sacred call,
 Could lay our lives down - though life be
 Thrice loved and precious to the sense
 Of such as reap the recompense
 Of life imperiled for just cause - 
 Imperiled, and yet preserved;
 While comrades, whom Duty as strongly nerved,
 Whose wives were all as dear, lie low.
 But these flags given, glad we go
 To waiting homes with vindicated laws.
