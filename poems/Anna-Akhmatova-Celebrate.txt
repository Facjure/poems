Celebrate our anniversary � can�t you see
tonight the snowy night of our first winter
comes back again in every road and tree -
that winter night of diamantine splendour.

Steam is pouring out of yellow stables,
the Moika river�s sinking under snow,
the moonlight�s misted as it is in fables,
and where we are heading � I don�t know.

There are icebergs on the Marsovo Pole.
The Lebyazh�ya�s crazed with crystal art.....
Whose soul can compare with my soul,
if joy and fear are in my heart? -

And if your voice, a marvellous bird�s,
quivers at my shoulder, in the night,
and the snow shines with a silver light,
warmed by a sudden ray, by your words?
