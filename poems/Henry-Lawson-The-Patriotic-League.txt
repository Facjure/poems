Behold! the biased foes of Right
Are conscious of their danger,
They�re startled by the dawning light,
So very long a stranger.
And fearing for their rotting laws,
Whose reign is nearly ended,
To study out the People�s cause
At last they�ve condescended.


�And this they call the �People�s Cause�,
Why this is insurrection!
They would revoke the very laws
We made for our protection!
An equal right with us they claim!
They�ll rob us by and by, sir!
We�ll form a league and steal a name
And tell another lie, sir.�


They took to gloss a base intrigue
A name that was demotic.
They stole a name and formed a league
And called it �Patriotic�.
They�ve resurrected ancient lies,
The world had most forgotten,
The liars think the world will rise
To back a Cause that�s rotten.

I know their creed, and know it well,
Too mean are its creators
To hope for heaven, or fear the hell
They�d make for agitators.
Old as the hills, and quite as dense
Though shaking like a jelly.
Time honoured to magnificence,
Religion of the Belly!
