---

Ay s'pose yu tenk life ban hard game.
 Ay guess yu lak to qvit, perhaps.
Ay hear yu say, "It ban a shame
 To see so many lucky chaps."
 Yu say, "Dese guys ban mostly yaps:
Ay vish ay had some money, tu,
 And not get all dese gude hard raps."
Val, Maester, it ban op to yu.

Sometimes ay s'pose yu vork long hours,
 And ant get wery fancy pay;
Den yu can't buying stacks of flowers
 And feed yure girl in gude caf�,
 And drenk yin rickies and frapp�.
Oh, yes! dis mak yu purty blue.
 Yu lak to have more fun, yu say?
Val, Maester, it ban op to yu.

Dis vorld ant got much room to spare
 For men vich make dis hard-luck cry, - 
'Bout von square foot vile dey ban har,
 And six feet after dey skol die.
 Time "fugit," - high-school vord for "fly";
And purty sune yure chance ban tru.
 So, ef yu lak to stack chips high,
Val, Maester, it ban op to yu.
