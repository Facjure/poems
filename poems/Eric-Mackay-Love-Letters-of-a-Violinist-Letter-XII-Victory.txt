Letter XII. Victory.


I.

Now have I reach'd the goal of my desire,
 For thou hast sworn - as sweetly as a bell
 Makes out its chime - the oath I love to tell,
The fealty-oath of which I never tire.
The lordly forest seems a giant's lyre,
 And sings, and rings, the thoughts that o'er it swell.


II.

The air is fill'd with voices. I have found
 Comfort at last, enthralment, and a joy
 Past all belief; a peace without alloy.
There is a splendour all about the ground
As if from Eden, when the world was drown'd,
 Something had come which death could not destroy.


III.

It seems, indeed, as if to me were sent
 A smile from Heaven - as if to-day the clods
 Were lined with silk - the trees divining rods,
And roses gems for some high tournament.
I should not be so proud, or so content,
 If I could sup, to-night, with all the gods.


IV.

A shrinï¿½d saint would change his place with me
 If he but knew the worth of what I feel.
 He is enrobed indeed, and for his weal
Hath much concern; but how forlorn is he!
How pale his pomp! He cannot sue to thee,
 But I am sainted every time I kneel.


V.

I walk'd abroad, to-day, ere yet the dark
 Had left the hills, and down the beaten road
 I saunter'd forth a mile from mine abode.
I heard, afar, the watchdog's sudden bark,
And, near at hand, the tuning of a lark,
 Safe in its nest, but weighted with an ode.


VI.

The moon was pacing up the sky serene,
 Pallid and pure, as if she late had shown
 Her outmost side, and fear'd to make it known;
And, like a nun, she gazed upon the scene
From bars of cloud that seemed to stand between,
 And pray'd and smiled, and smiled and pray'd alone.


VII.

The stars had fled. Not one remain'd behind
 To warn or comfort; or to make amends
 For hope delay'd, - for ecstasy that ends
At dawn's approach. The firmament was blind
Of all its eyes; and, wanton up the wind,
 There came the shuddering that the twilight sends.


VIII.

The hills exulted at the Morning's birth, -
 And clouds assembled, quick, as heralds run
 Before a king to say the fight is won.
The rich, warm daylight fell upon the earth
Like wine outpour'd in madness, or in mirth,
 To celebrate the rising of the sun.


IX.

And when the soaring lark had done its prayer,
 The holy thing, self-poised amid the blue
 Of that great sky, did seem, a space or two,
To pause and think, and then did clip the air
And dropped to earth to claim his guerdon there.
 "Thank God!" I cried, "My dearest dream is true!"


X.

I was too happy, then, to leap and dance;
 But I could ponder; I could gaze and gaze
 From earth to sky and back to woodland ways.
The bird had thrill'd my heart, and cheer'd my glance,
For he had found to-day his nest-romance,
 And lov'd a mate, and crown'd her with his praise.


XI.

O Love! my Love! I would not for a throne,
 I would not for the thrones of all the kings
 Who yet have liv'd, or for a seraph's wings,
Or for the nod of Jove when night hath flown,
Consent to rule an empire all alone.
 No! I must have the grace of our two rings.


XII.

I must possess thee from the crowning curl
 Down to the feet, and from the beaming eye
 Down to the bosom where my treasures lie.
From blush to blush, and from the rows of pearl
That light thy smile, I must possess thee, girl,
 And be thy lord and master till I die.


XIII.

This, and no less: the keeper of thy fame,
 The proud controller of each silken tress,
 And each dear item of thy loveliness,
And every oath, and every dainty name
Known to a bride: a picture in a frame
 Of golden hair, to turn to and caress.


XIV.

And though I know thee prone, in vacant hours,
 To laugh and talk with those who circumvent
 And make mad speeches; though I know the bent
Of some such men, and though in ladies' bowers
They brag of swords - I know my proven powers;
 I know myself and thee, and am content.


XV.

I know myself; and why should I demur?
 The lily, bowing to the breeze's play,
 Is not forgetful of the sun in May.
She is his nymph, and with a servitor
She doth but jest. The sun looks down at her,
 And knows her true, and loves her day by day.


XVI.

E'en so I thee, O Lady of my Heart!
 O Lady white as lilies on the lea,
 And fair as foam upon the ocean free
Whereon the sun hath sent a shining dart!
E'en so I love thee, blameless as thou art,
 And with my soul's desire I compass thee.


XVII.

For thou art Woman in the sweetest sense
 Of true endowment, and a bride indeed
 Fit for Apollo. This is Woman's need:
To be a beacon when the air is dense,
A bower of peace, a life-long recompense -
 This is the sum of Woman's worldly creed.


XVIII.

And what is Man the while? And what his will?
 And what the furtherance of his earthly hope?
 To turn to Faith, to turn, as to a rope
A drowning sailor; all his blood to spill
For One he loves, to keep her out of ill -
 This is the will of Man, and this his scope.


XIX.

'Tis like the tranquil sea, that knows anon
 It can be wild, and keep away from home
 A thousand ships - and lash itself to foam -
And beat the shore, and all that lies thereon -
And catch the thunder ere the flash has gone
 Forth from the cloud that spans it like a dome.


XX.

This is the will of Man, and this is mine.
 But lo! I love thee more than wealth or fame,
 More than myself, and more than those who came
With Christ's commission from the goal divine.
Soul of my soul, and mine as I am thine,
 I cling to thee, my Life! as fire to flame.
