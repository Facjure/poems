title: The Head Above The Fog
---

 Something do I see
Above the fog that sheets the mead,
A figure like to life indeed,
Moving along with spectre-speed,
 Seen by none but me.

 O the vision keen! -
Tripping along to me for love
As in the flesh it used to move,
Only its hat and plume above
 The evening fog-fleece seen.

 In the day-fall wan,
When nighted birds break off their song,
Mere ghostly head it skims along,
Just as it did when warm and strong,
 Body seeming gone.

 Such it is I see
Above the fog that sheets the mead -
Yea, that which once could breathe and plead! -
Skimming along with spectre-speed
 To a last tryst with me.
