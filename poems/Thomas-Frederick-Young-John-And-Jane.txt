Said Jane to John, "Come, let us wed,
 For know, dear John, I love you,
And, by the bright stars overhead,
 There's none I place above you."

"I doubt it not," said John, "and I
 Reciprocate the feeling,
And here, with one despairing cry,
 I kneel, and love you, kneeling."

"Then why, dear John, do you despair,
 If you do love so madly?"
"Because," said John, "my pocket there
 Is slim, and furnish'd badly."

"Oh, that is naught," said Jane, with glee,
 "I'd marry you to-morrow,
And live on bread, and water free,
 Without one grain of sorrow."

"All right," said John, "I'm with you there,
 Old Logan's charming daughter,
You'll get the bread, the work to share,
 And I will get the water."
