[The following lines are said by the nurse when moving the child's foot up and down.]

The dog of the kill,[*]
He went to the mill
To lick mill-dust:
The miller he came
With a stick on his back, - 
Home, dog, home!
The foot behind,
The foot before:
When he came to a stile,
Thus he jumped o'er.

[Footnote *: That is, kiln.]
