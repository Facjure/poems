A toast to the splendid daughters
Of the New World over the waters,
 A world that is great as new;
Daughters of brave old races,
Daughters of heights and spaces,
Broad seas and broad earth places - 
 Hail to your land and you!

The sun and the winds have fed you;
The width of your world has led you
 Out into the larger view;
Strong with a strength that is tender,
Bright with a primal splendour,
Homage and praise we render - 
 Hail to your land and you!

Sisters and daughters and mothers,
Standing abreast with your brothers,
 Working for things that are true;
Thinking and doing and daring,
Giving, receiving, and sharing,
Earning the crowns you are wearing - 
 Hail to your land and you!
