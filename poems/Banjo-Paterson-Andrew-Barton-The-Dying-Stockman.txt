 (Air: �The Old Stable Jacket.�)


A strapping young stockman lay dying,
His saddle supporting his head;
His two mates around him were crying,
As he rose on his pillow and said:

Chorus

 �Wrap me up with my stockwhip and blanket,
 And bury me deep down below,
 Where the dingoes and crows can�t molest me,
 In the shade where the coolibahs grow.

�Oh! had I the flight of the bronzewing,
Far o�er the plains would I fly,
Straight to the land of my childhood,
And there would I lay down and die.

Chorus: Wrap me up, &amp;c.

�Then cut down a couple of saplings,
Place one at my head and my toe,
Carve on them cross, stockwhip, and saddle,
To show there�s a stockman below.

Chorus: Wrap me up, &amp;c.

�Hark! there�s the wail of a dingo,
Watchful and weird�I must go,
For it tolls the death-knell of the stockman
From the gloom of the scrub down below.

Chorus: Wrap me up, &amp;c.

�There�s tea in the battered old billy;
Place the pannikins out in a row,
And we�ll drink to the next merry meeting,
In the place where all good fellows go.

Chorus: Wrap me up, &amp;c.

�And oft in the shades of the twilight,
When the soft winds are whispering low,
And the dark�ning shadows are falling,
Sometimes think of the stockman below.�

 Chorus: Wrap me up, &amp;c.
