 Man of despair and death,
 Bought and slaved in the gangs,
 Starved and stripped and left
 To the pitiful pitiless night,
 Away with your selfish thoughts!
 Touch not your ignorant life!
 Are there no masters of slaves,
 Jeering, cynical, strong - 
 Are there no brigands (say),
 With the words of Christ on their lips
 And the daggers under their cloaks - 
 Is there not one of these
 That you can steal on and kill?
 O as the Swiss mountaineer
 Dogged on the perilous heights
 His disciplined conqueror foes: {39a}
 Caught up one in his arms
 And, laughing exultantly,
 Plunged with him to the abyss:
 So let it be with you!
 An eye for an eye, and a tooth
 For a tooth, and a life for a life!
 Tell it, this hateful strong
 Contemptuous hypocrite world,
 Tell it that, if we must live
 As dogs and as worse than dogs,
 At least we can die like men!
 Tell it there is a woe
 Not for the conquered alone! {39b}
 An eye for an eye, and a tooth
 For a tooth, and a life for a life!
