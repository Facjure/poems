title: Falling Leaves.

There was a sound of music low--
An undertone of laughter;
The song was done, and can't you guess
The words that followed after?

Like autumn leaves sometimes they fall--
The words that burn and falter;
And is it true they too must fade
Upon Love's sacred alter?

From memory each one of us
Can cull some sweetest treasure;
Yet golden days, like golden leaves,
Give pain as well as pleasure.

There was a sound of music low--
An undertone of laughter:
The sun was gone--yet heaven knew
The stars that followed after.
