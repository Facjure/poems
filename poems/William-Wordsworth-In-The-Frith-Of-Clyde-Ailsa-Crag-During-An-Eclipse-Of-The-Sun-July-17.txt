title: In The Frith Of Clyde, Ailsa Crag - During An Eclipse Of The Sun, July 17
---

 Since risen from ocean, ocean to defy,
 Appeared the crag of Ailsa, ne'er did morn
 With gleaming lights more gracefully adorn
 His sides, or wreathe with mist his forehead high:
 Now, faintly darkening with the sun's eclipse,
 Still is he seen, in lone sublimity,
 Towering above the sea and little ships;
 For dwarfs the tallest seem while sailing by,
 Each for her haven; with her freight of Care,
 Pleasure, or Grief, and Toil that seldom looks
 Into the secret of to-morrow's fare;
 Though poor, yet rich, without the wealth of books,
 Or aught that watchful Love to Nature owes
 For her mute Powers, fixed Forms, or transient Shows.
