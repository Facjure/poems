When wit and genius meet their doom
In all-devouring flame,
They tell us of the fate of Rome,
And bid us fear the same.


O�er Murray�s loss the muses wept,
They felt the rude alarm,
Yet bless�d the guardian care that kept
His sacred head from harm.


There Memory, like the bee that�s fed
From Flora�s balmy store,
The quintessence of all he read
Had treasured up before.


The lawless herd, with fury blind,
Have done him cruel wrong;
The flowers are gone�but still we find
The honey on his tongue.
