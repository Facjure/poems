I know not why my soul is rack'd
 Why I ne'er smile as was my wont:
I only know that, as a fact,
 I don't.
I used to roam o'er glen and glade
 Buoyant and blithe as other folk:
And not unfrequently I made
 A joke.

A minstrel's fire within me burn'd,
 I'd sing, as one whose heart must break,
Lay upon lay: I nearly learn'd
 To shake.
All day I sang; of love, of fame,
 Of fights our fathers fought of yore,
Until the thing almost became
 A bore.

I cannot sing the old songs now!
 It is not that I deem them low;
'Tis that I can't remember how
 They go.
I could not range the hills till high
 Above me stood the summer moon:
And as to dancing, I could fly
 As soon.

The sports, to which with boyish glee
 I sprang erewhile, attract no more;
Although I am but sixty-three
 Or four.
Nay, worse than that, I've seem'd of late
 To shrink from happy boyhood - boys
Have grown so noisy, and I hate
 A noise.

They fright me, when the beech is green,
 By swarming up its stem for eggs:
They drive their horrid hoops between
 My legs:-
It's idle to repine, I know;
 I'll tell you what I'll do instead:
I'll drink my arrowroot, and go
 To bed.
