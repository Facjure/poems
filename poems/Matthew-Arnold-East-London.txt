�Twas August, and the fierce sun overhead
Smote on the squalid streets of Bethnal Green,
And the pale weaver, through his windows seen
In Spitalfields, looked thrice dispirited.
I met a preacher there I knew, and said:
�Ill and o�erworked, how fare you in this scene?�,
�Bravely!� said he; �for I of late have been
Much cheered with thoughts of Christ, the living bread.�
O human soul! as long as thou canst so
Set up a mark of everlasting light,
Above the howling senses� ebb and flow,
To cheer thee, and to right thee if thou roam,
Not with lost toil thou labourest through the night!
Thou mak�st the heaven thou hop�st indeed thy home.
