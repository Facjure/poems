I know not if in others' eyes
 She seem'd almost divine;
But far beyond a doubt it lies
 That she did not in mine.

Each common stone on which she trod
 I did not deem a pearl:
Nay it is not a little odd
 How I abhorr'd that girl.

We met at balls and picnics oft,
 Or on a drawingroom stair;
My aunt invariably cough'd
 To warn me she was there:

At croquet I was bid remark
 How queenly was her pose,
As with stern glee she drew the dark
 Blue ball beneath her toes,

And made the Red fly many a foot:
 Then calmly she would stoop,
Smiling an angel smile, to put
 A partner through his hoop.

At archery I was made observe
 That others aim'd more near.
But none so tenderly could curve
 The elbow round the ear:

Or if we rode, perhaps she DID
 Pull sharply at the curb;
But then the way in which she slid
 From horseback was superb!

She'd throw off odes, again, whose flow
 And fire were more than Sapphic;
Her voice was sweet, and very low;
 Her singing quite seraphic:

She WAS a seraph, lacking wings.
 That much I freely own.
But, it is one of those queer things
 Whose cause is all unknown -

(Such are the wasp, the household fly,
 The shapes that crawl and curl
By men called centipedes) - that I
 Simply abhorred that girl.

* * *

No doubt some mystery underlies
 All things which are and which are not:
And 'tis the function of the Wise
 Not to expound to us what is what,

But let his consciousness play round
 The matter, and at ease evolve
The problem, shallow or profound,
 Which our poor wits have fail'd to solve,

Then tell us blandly we are fools;
 Whereof we were aware before:
That truth they taught us at the schools,
 And p'raps (who knows?) a little more.

- But why did we two disagree?
 Our tastes, it may be, did not dovetail:
All I know is, we ne'er shall be
 Hero and heroine of a love-tale.
