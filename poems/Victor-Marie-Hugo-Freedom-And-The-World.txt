[Inscription under a Statue of the Virgin and Child, at Guernsey. - The poet sees in the emblem a modern Atlas, i.e., Freedom supporting the World.]

("Le peuple est petit.")


Weak is the People - but will grow beyond all other - 
Within thy holy arms, thou fruitful victor-mother!
O Liberty, whose conquering flag is never furled - 
Thou bearest Him in whom is centred all the World.
