So, I shall see her in three days
And just one night, but nights are short,
Then two long hours, and that is morn.
See how I come, unchanged, unworn
Feel, where my life broke off from thine,
How fresh the splinters keep and fine,
Only a touch and we combine!


Too long, this time of year, the days!
But nights at least the nights are short.
As night shows where her one moon is,
A hand�s-breadth of pure light and bliss,
So life�s night gives my lady birth
And my eyes hold her! What is worth
The rest of heaven, the rest of earth?


O loaded curls, release your store
Of warmth and scent, as once before
The tingling hair did, lights and darks
Out-breaking into fairy sparks,
When under curl and curl I pried
After the warmth and scent inside,
Thro� lights and darks how manifold
The dark inspired, the light controlled!
As early Art embrowned the gold.


What great fear, should one say, �Three days
That change the world might change as well
Your fortune; and if joy delays,
Be happy that no worse befell!�
What small fear, if another says,
�Three days and one short night beside
May throw no shadow on your ways;
But years must teem with change untried,
With chance not easily defied,
With an end somewhere undescried.�
No fear! or if a fear be born
This minute, it dies out in scorn.
Fear? I shall see her in three days
And one night, now the nights are short,
Then just two hours, and that is morn.
