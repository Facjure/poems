Lie down, and let the billows hide your shame,
Oh, shorn and naked outcast of the seas!
You who confided to each ocean breeze
Your coming conquests, and made loud acclaim
Of your own grandeur and exalted fame;
You who have catered to they world's disease;
You who have drunk hate's wine, and found the lees;
Lie down! and let all men forget your name!

You dreamed of world dominion! you! the spawn
Of hell and hatred - Foe to all things free - 
Sworn enemy to honour, truth and right;
Too poor a thing now for the Devil's pawn,
Let the large mercy of the outraged sea
Engulf and hide you evermore from sight.
