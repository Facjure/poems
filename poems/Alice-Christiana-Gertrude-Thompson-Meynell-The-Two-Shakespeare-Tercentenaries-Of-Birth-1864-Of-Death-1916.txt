TO SHAKESPEARE

 Longer than thine, than thine,
 Is now my time of life; and thus thy years
 Seem to be clasped and harboured within mine.
 O how ignoble this my clasp appears!

 Thy unprophetic birth,
 Thy darkling death: living I might have seen
 That cradle, marked those labours, closed that earth.
 O first, O last, O infinite between!

 Now that my life has shared
 Thy dedicated date, O mortal, twice,
 To what all-vain embrace shall be compared
 My lean enclosure of thy paradise?

 To ignorant arms that fold
 A poet to a foolish breast?The Line,
 That is not, with the world within its hold?
 So, days with days, my days encompass thine.

 Child, Stripling, Man-the sod.
 Might I talk little language to thee, pore
 On thy last silence?O thou city of God,
 My waste lies after thee, and lies before.
