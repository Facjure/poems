FROM "THE TRIUMPH OF MUSIC."


 ... Fresh from bathing in orient fountains,
 In wells of rock water and snow,
 Comes the Dawn with her pearl-brimming fingers
O'er the thyme and the pines of yon mountain;
 Where she steps young blossoms fresh blow....

And sweet as the star-beams in fountains,
 And soft as the fall of the dew,
Wet as the hues of the rain-arch,
To me was the Dawn when on mountains
 Pearl-capped o'er the hyaline blue,
 Saint-fair and pure thro' the blue,
Her spirit in dimples comes dancing,
 In dimples of light and of fire,
 Planting her footprints in roses
On the floss of the snow-drifts, while glancing
 Large on her brow is her tire,
 Gemmed with the morning-star's fire.

But sweet as the incense from altars,
 And warm as the light on a cloud,
 Sad as the wail of bleak woodlands,
To me was the Night when she falters
 In the sorrowful folds of her shroud,
 In the far-blowing black of her shroud,

O'er the flower-strewn bier of her lover,
 The Day lying faded and fair
 In the red-curtained chambers of air.
When disheveled I've seen her uncover
 Her gold-girdled raven of hair - 
All hooped with the gold of the even - 
 And for this sad burial prepare,
The spirit of Night in the heaven
 To me was most wondrously fair,
So fair that I wished it were given
 To die in the rays of her hair,
 Die wrapped in her gold-girdled hair.
