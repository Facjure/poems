 Because my overcoat's in pawn,
 I choose to take my glass
 Within a little bistro on
 The rue du Montparnasse;
 The dusty bins with bottles shine,
 The counter's lined with zinc,
 And there I sit and drink my wine,
 And think and think and think.

 I think of hoary old Stamboul,
 Of Moslem and of Greek,
 Of Persian in coat of wool,
 Of Kurd and Arab sheikh;
 Of all the types of weal and woe,
 And as I raise my glass,
 Across Galata bridge I know
 They pass and pass and pass.

 I think of citron-trees aglow,
 Of fan-palms shading down,
 Of sailors dancing heel and toe
 With wenches black and brown;
 And though it's all an ocean far
 From Yucatan to France,
 I'll bet beside the old bazaar
 They dance and dance and dance.

 I think of Monte Carlo, where
 The pallid croupiers call,
 And in the gorgeous, guilty air
 The gamblers watch the ball;
 And as I flick away the foam
 With which my beer is crowned,
 The wheels beneath the gilded dome
 Go round and round and round.

 I think of vast Niagara,
 Those gulfs of foam a-shine,
 Whose mighty roar would stagger a
 More prosy bean than mine;
 And as the hours I idly spend
 Against a greasy wall,
 I know that green the waters bend
 And fall and fall and fall.

 I think of Nijni Novgorod
 And Jews who never rest;
 And womenfolk with spade and hod
 Who slave in Buda-Pest;
 Of squat and sturdy Japanese
 Who pound the paddy soil,
 And as I loaf and smoke at ease
 They toil and toil and toil.

 I think of shrines in Hindustan,
 Of cloistral glooms in Spain,
 Of minarets in Ispahan,
 Of St. Sophia's fane,
 Of convent towers in Palestine,
 Of temples in Cathay,
 And as I stretch and sip my wine
 They pray and pray and pray.

 And so my dreams I dwell within,
 And visions come and go,
 And life is passing like a Cin-
 Ematographic Show;
 Till just as surely as my pipe
 Is underneath my nose,
 Amid my visions rich and ripe
 I doze and doze and doze.
