There was a man lived in the moon, lived in the moon,
lived in the moon,
There was a man lived in the moon,
And his name was Aiken Drum,
And he played upon a ladle, a ladle, a ladle,
And he played upon a ladle,
And his name was Aiken Drum.

And his hat was made of good cream cheese,
And his name, &amp;c.

And his coat was made of good roast beef,
And his name, &amp;c.

And his buttons were made of penny loaves,
And his name, &amp;c.

His waistcoat was made of crust of pies,
And his name, &amp;c.

His breeches were made of haggis bags,
And his name, &amp;c.

There was a man in another town,
And his name was Willy Wood;
And he played upon a razor,
And his name was Willy Wood.

And he ate up all the good cream cheese,
And his name, &amp;c.

And he ate up all the good roast beef,
And his name, &amp;c.

And he ate up all the penny loaves,
And his name, &amp;c.

And he ate up all the good pie crust,
And his name, &amp;c.

But he choked upon the haggis bags,
And there was an end of Willy Wood.
