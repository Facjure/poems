'The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the street.' - PROVERBS xxvi. 13.

There are no lions in the street;
 No lions in the way.
Go seek the goal, thou slothful soul,
 Awake, awake, I say.

Thou dost but dream of obstacles;
 In God's great lexicon,
That word illstarred, no page has marred;
 Press on, I say, press on.

Nothing can keep thee from thine own
 But thine own slothful mind.
To one who knocks, each door unlocks;
 And he who seeks, shall find.
