 Some names there are of telling sound,
 Whose voweled syllables free
 Are pledge that they shall ever live renowned;
 Such seem to be
 A Frigate's name (by present glory spanned) - 
 The Cumberland.

 Sounding name as ere was sung,
 Flowing, rolling on the tongue - 
 Cumberland! Cumberland!

 She warred and sunk. There's no denying
 That she was ended - quelled;
 And yet her flag above her fate is flying,
 As when it swelled
 Unswallowed by the swallowing sea: so grand - 
 The Cumberland.

 Goodly name as ere was sung,
 Roundly rolling on the tongue - 
 Cumberland! Cumberland!

 What need to tell how she was fought - 
 The sinking flaming gun - 
 The gunner leaping out the port - 
 Washed back, undone!
 Her dead unconquerably manned
 The Cumberland.

 Noble name as ere was sung,
 Slowly roll it on the tongue - 
 Cumberland! Cumberland!

 Long as hearts shall share the flame
 Which burned in that brave crew,
 Her fame shall live - outlive the victor's name;
 For this is due.
 Your flag and flag-staff shall in story stand - 
 Cumberland!

 Sounding name as ere was sung,
 Long they'll roll it on the tongue - 
 Cumberland! Cumberland!
