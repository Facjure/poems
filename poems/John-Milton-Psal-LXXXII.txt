title: Psal. LXXXII.

God in the *1great *1assembly stands
Of Kings and lordly States,
Among the gods*2 on both his hands.
He judges and debates.
How long will ye *3pervert the right
With *4judgment false and wrong
Favouring the wicked by your might,
Who thence grow bold and strong?
*5Regard the *5weak and fatherless
*5Dispatch the *5poor mans cause,
And *6raise the man in deep distress
By *6just and equal Lawes.
Defend the poor and desolate,
And rescue from the hands
Of wicked men the low estate
Of him that help demands.
They know not nor will understand,
In darkness they walk on,
The Earths foundations all are *7mov'd
And *7out of order gon.
I said that ye were Gods, yea all
The Sons of God most high
But ye shall die like men, and fall
As other Princes die.
Rise God, *8judge thou the earth in might,
This wicked earth *redress,
For thou art he who shalt by right
The Nations all possess.
