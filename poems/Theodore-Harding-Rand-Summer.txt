O come, unpack the heart of care!
Kingcups sun the meadows o'er,
The yellowbugle sudden blows
By the river's tidal flows,
And the heavens are bare.

Room, room, and open sky,
River or brook or lake hard by,
Buttercups, daisies, grasses, clover,
Bobolinks, meadowlarks - these love I!
Whiskodink!


Sail, swallows, sail this emerald sea
Waving to the west wind's breath!
Earth has few other fields like these,
Sweet of sun and tidal breeze,
And the droning bee.

Room, room, and open sky,
River or brook or lake hard by,
Buttercups, daisies, grasses, clover,
Bobolinks, meadowlarks - these love I!
Bobolink!

And now the white clouds sail along,
Azure-domed and idle free!
The air is lush with honeyed blooms,
Flashing go the summer's looms,
List her cheery song:


Room, room, and open sky,
River or brook or lake hard by,
Buttercups, daisies, grasses, clover,
Bobolinks, meadowlarks - these love I!
Whiskodink!
