 Though I am an old man
 With my bones very brittle,
 Though I am a poor old man
 Worth very little,
 Yet I suck at my long pipe
 At peace in the sun,
 I do not fret nor much regret
 That my work is done.

 If I were a young man
 With my bones full of marrow,
 Oh, if I were a bold young man
 Straight as an arrow,
 And if I had the same years
 To live once again,
 I would not change their simple range
 Of laughter and pain.

 If I were a young man
 And young was my Lily,
 A smart girl, a bold young man,
 Both of us silly.
 And though from time before I knew
 She'd stab me with pain,
 Though well I knew she'd not be true,
 I'd love her again.

 If I were a young man
 With a brisk, healthy body,
 Oh, if I were a bold young man
 With love of rum toddy,
 Though I knew that I was spiting
 My old age with pain,
 My happy lip would touch and sip
 Again and again.

 If I were a young man
 With my bones full of marrow,
 Oh, if I were a bold young man
 Straight as an arrow,
 I'd store up no virtue
 For Heaven's distant plain,
 I'd live at ease as I did please
 And sin once again.
