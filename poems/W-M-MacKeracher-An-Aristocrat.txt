Her fair companions she outshone,
 As this or that transcendent star
Makes all its sister orbs look wan
 And dim and lustreless and far.

Her charm impressed the fleeting glance,
 But chiefly the reflective mind;
A century's inheritance,
 By carefull'st nurture still refined.

Devotions, manners, hopes that were,
 Ideals high, traditions fine,
Were felt to culminate in her,
 The efflorescence of her line.

What time and cost conspired to trace
Her lineaments of perfect grace!
