[R.H.]


 Little Julia, since that we
 May not as our elders be,
 Let us blithely fill the days
 Of our youth with pleasant plays.
 First we'll up at earliest dawn,
 While as yet the dew is on
 The sooth'd grasses and the pied
 Blossomings of morningtide;
 Next, with rinsed cheeks that shine
 As the enamell'd eglantine,
 We will break our fast on bread
 With both cream and honey spread;
 Then, with many a challenge-call,
 We will romp from house and hall,
 Gypsying with the birds and bees
 Of the green-tress'd garden trees.
 In a bower of leaf and vine
 Thou shalt be a lady fine
 Held in duress by the great
 Giant I shall personate.
 Next, when many mimics more
 Like to these we have played o'er,



 We'll betake us home-along
 Hand in hand at evensong.
