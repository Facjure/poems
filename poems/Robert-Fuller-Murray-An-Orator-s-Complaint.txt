title: An Orator's Complaint
---

How many the troubles that wait
 On mortals!--especially those
 Who endeavour in eloquent prose
To expound their views, and orate.

Did you ever attempt to speak
 When you hadn't a word to say?
 Did you find that it wouldn't pay,
And subside, feeling dreadfully weak?

Did you ever, when going ahead
 In a fervid defence of the Stage,
 Get checked in your noble rage
By somehow losing your thread?

 Did you ever rise to reply
 To a toast (say 'The Volunteers'),
 And evoke loud laughter and cheers,
When you didn't exactly know why?

Did you ever wax witty, and when
 You had smashed an opponent quite small,
 Did he seem not to mind it at all,
But get up and smash you again?

If any or all of these things
 Have happened to you (as to me),
 I think you'll be found to agree
With yours truly, when sadly he sings:

'How many the troubles that wait
 On mortals!--especially those
 Who endeavour in eloquent prose
To expound their views, and orate.'
