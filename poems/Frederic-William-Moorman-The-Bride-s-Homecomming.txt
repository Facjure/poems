A weddin', a woo,
A clog an' a shoe,
A pot full o' porridge; away we go!
 A Yorkshire Wedding-Rhyme.


Thoo mun hod on tight, my darlin',
 We've mony a beck to cross;
Twix' thy father's hoose an' mine, love,
 There's a vast o' slacks an' moss.
But t' awd mare, shoo weant whemmle(1)
 Though there's twee on her back astride;
Shoo's as prood as me, is Snowball,
 Noo I's fetchin' heame my bride.
A weddin', a woo,
A clog an' a shoe,
 A pot full o' porridge; away we go!

Gow! but I feel sae leetsome,
 Sin I've lived to see this day;
My heart is like a blackbod's
 Efter a shoor i' May.
I' t' sky aboon nea lairock
 Has sae mich reet to sing
As I have, noo I've wedded
 T' lile lass o' Fulsa Ing.
A weddin', a woo,
A clog an' a shoe,
 A pot full o' porridge; away we go!

Does ta hear yon watter bubblin',
 Deep doon i' t' moorland streams?
It soonds like childer' voices
 When they're laughin' i' their dreams.
An' look at yon lang-tailed pyots,(2)
 There s three on 'em, I'll uphod!
Folks say that three's for a weddin',
 Ay, a pyot's a canny bod.
A weddin', a woo,
A clog an' a shoe,
 A pot full o' porridge; away we go!

I love to feel thee clingin'
 Wi' thy hands aroond my breast;
Thy bosom's leetly heavin',
 Like a ship on t' saut waves' crest.
An' thy breath is sweet as t' breezes,
 That cooms ower t' soothern hills,
When t' violet blaws i' t' springtime
 Wi' t' yollow daffydills.
A weddin', a woo,
A clog an' a shoe,
 A pot full o' porridge; away we go!

Is ta gittin' tired, my honey,
 We'll be heame i' hafe an hour;
Thoo'll see our hoose an' staggarth,
 Wi' t' birk-trees bendin' ower.
There's a lillilow(3) i' our cham'er
 To welcome my viewly bride ;
An' sean we'll be theer oorsels, lass,
 Liggin' cosy side by side.
A weddin', a woo,
A clog an' a shoe,
 A pot full o' porridge; away we go!
