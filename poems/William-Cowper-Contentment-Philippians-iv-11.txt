title: Contentment. - Philippians iv.11.
---

Fierce passions discompose the mind,
As tempests vex the sea:
But calm content and peace we find,
When, Lord, we turn to thee.


In vain by reason and by rule
We try to bend the will;
For none but in the Saviour�s school
Can learn the heavenly skill.


Since at his feet my soul has sat,
His gracious words to hear,
Contented with my present state,
I cast on him my care.


�Art thou a sinner, soul?� he said,
�Then how canst thou complain?
How light thy troubles here, if weigh�d
With everlasting pain!


�If thou of murmuring wouldst be cured,
Compare thy griefs with mine;
Think what my love for thee endured,
And thou wilt not repine.


��Tis I appoint thy daily lot,
And I do all things well;
Thou soon shalt leave this wretched spot,
And rise with me to dwell.


�In life my grace shall strength supply,
Proportion�d to thy day;
At death thou still shalt find me nigh,
To wipe thy tears away.


Thus I, who once my wretched days
In vain repinings spent,
Taught in my Saviour�s school of grace,
Have learnt to be content.
