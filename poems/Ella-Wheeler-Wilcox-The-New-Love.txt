title: The New Love
---

I thought my heart was death chilled,
 I thought its fires were cold;
But the new love, the new love,
 It warmeth like the old.

I thought its rooms were shadowed
 With the gloom of endless night;
But the new love, the new love,
 It fills them full of light.

I thought the chambers empty,
 And proclaimed it unto men;
But the new love, the new love,
 It peoples them again.

I thought its halls were silent,
 And hushed the whole day long;
But the new love, the new love,
 It fills them full of song.

Then here is to the new love,
 Let who will sing the old;
The new love, the new love,
 'Tis more than fame or gold.

For it gives us joy for sorrow,
 And it gives us warmth for cold;
Oh! the new love, the new love,
 'Tis better than the old.
