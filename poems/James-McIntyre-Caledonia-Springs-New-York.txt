The water spouts up from the ground
And there doth form a pond around,
'Tis fed from no apparent rills,
And it near by drives several mills.

And here the little ponds are seen
Where fish are propogate by Green,
Fish hatcheries here had their birth,
And now they're spread o'er all the earth.

Here in each pond thousands of trout
Rush around their circular route,
Of various breeds, age and size,
Speckled o'er with various dyes.

Geologists do gaze with pride
On specimens all petrified,
Here church is built of those rare stone,
Fish, reptiles, birds, in days bygone.

Strange thoughts in mind it doth awake,
As it is far from sea and lake,
Even the hill tops do abound
With proofs here flowed the sea profound.

With reverence we gaze around
On an ancient burial ground,
Those who once did tread the heather
Now rest quietly here together.
