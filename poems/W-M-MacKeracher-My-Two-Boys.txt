To some the heavenly Father good
 Has given raiment rich and fine,
And tables spread with dainty food,
 And jewels rare that brightly shine.

To some He's given gold that buys
 Immunity from petty care,
Freedom and leisure and the prize
 Of pleasing books and pictures fair.

To some He's given wide domains
 And high estate and tranquil ease,
And homes where all refinement reigns
 And everything combines to please.

To some He's given minds to know
 The what and how, the where and when;
To some, a genius that can throw
 A light upon the hearts of men.

To some He's given fortunes free
 From sorrows and replete with joys;
To some, a thousand friends; to me
 He's given my two little boys.
