I

I shall rot here, with those whom in their day
 You never knew,
And alien ones who, ere they chilled to clay,
 Met not my view,
Will in your distant grave-place ever neighbour you.

II

No shade of pinnacle or tree or tower,
 While earth endures,
Will fall on my mound and within the hour
 Steal on to yours;
One robin never haunt our two green covertures.

III

Some organ may resound on Sunday noons
 By where you lie,
Some other thrill the panes with other tunes
 Where moulder I;
No selfsame chords compose our common lullaby.

IV

The simply-cut memorial at my head
 Perhaps may take
A Gothic form, and that above your bed
 Be Greek in make;
No linking symbol show thereon for our tale's sake.

V

And in the monotonous moils of strained, hard-run
 Humanity,
The eternal tie which binds us twain in one
 No eye will see
Stretching across the miles that sever you from me.
