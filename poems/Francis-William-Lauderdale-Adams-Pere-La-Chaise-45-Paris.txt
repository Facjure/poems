 I stood in Pere-la-Chaise. The putrid city,
Paris, the harlot of the nations, lay,
 The bug-bright thing that knows not love nor pity,
Flashing her bare shame to the summer's day.

 Here where I stand, they slew you, brothers, whom
Hell's wrongs unutterable had made as mad.
 The rifle-shots re-echoed in his tomb,
The gilded scoundrel's who had been so glad.

 O Morny, O blood-sucker of thy race!
O brain, O hand that wrought out empire that
 The lust in one for power, for tinsel place,
Might rest; one lecher's hungry heart grow fat, - 

 Is it for nothing, now and evermore,
O you whose sin in life had death in ease,
 The murder of your victims beats the door
Wherein your careless carrion lies at peace?
