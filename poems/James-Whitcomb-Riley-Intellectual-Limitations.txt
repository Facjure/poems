 Parunts knows lots more than us,
But they don't know all things, - 
 'Cause we ketch 'em, lots o' times,
Even on little small things.

 One time Winnie ask' her Ma,
At the winder, sewin',
 What's the wind a-doin' when
It's a-not a-blowin'?

 Yes, an' 'Del', that very day,
When we're nearly froze out,
 He ask' Uncle where it goes
When the fire goes out?

 Nen I run to ask my Pa,
That way, somepin' funny;
 But I can't say ist but "Say,"
 When he turn to me an' say,
"Well, what is it, Honey?"
