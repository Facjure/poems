John-A-Dreams and Harum-Scarum
Came a-riding into town:
At the Sign o' the Jug-and-Jorum
There they met with Low-lie-down.

Brave in shoes of Romany leather,
Bodice blue and gipsy gown,
And a cap of fur and feather,
In the inn sat Low-lie-down.

Harum-Scarum kissed her lightly,
Smiled into her eyes of brown,
Clasped her waist and held her tightly,
Saying, "Love me, Low-lie-down."

Then with many an oath and swagger,
As a man of great renown,
On the board he clapped his dagger,
Called for sack and sat him down.

So a while they laughed together:
Then he rose and with a frown
Sighed, "While still 't is pleasant weather
I must leave thee, Low-lie-down."

So away rode Harum-Scarum,
With a song rode out of town;
At the sign o' the Jug-and-Jorum
Weeping tarried Low-lie-down.

Then this John-a-dreams, in tatters,
In his pocket ne'er a crown,
Touched her saying, "Wench, what matters!
Dry your eyes and, come, sit down.

"Here's my hand: let's roam together,
Far away from thorp and town.
Here's my heart for any weather,
And my dreams, too, Low-lie-down.

"Some men call me dreamer, poet;
Some men call me fool and clown
What I am but you shall know it!
Come with me, sweet Low-lie-down.

For a little while she pondered.
Smiled and said, "Let care go drown!"
Rose and kissed him. Forth they wandered,
John-a-dreams and Low-lie-down.
