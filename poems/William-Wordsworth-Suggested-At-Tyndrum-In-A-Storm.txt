title: Suggested At Tyndrum In A Storm
---

 Enough of garlands, of the Arcadian crook,
 And all that Greece and Italy have sung
 Of Swains reposing myrtle groves among!
 'Ours' couch on naked rocks, will cross a brook
 Swoln with chill rains, nor ever cast a look
 This way or that, or give it even a thought
 More than by smoothest pathway may be brought
 Into a vacant mind. Can written book
 Teach what 'they' learn? Up, hardy Mountaineer!
 And guide the Bard, ambitious to be One
 Of Nature's privy council, as thou art,
 On cloud-sequestered heights, that see and hear
 To what dread Powers He delegates his part
 On earth, who works in the heaven of heavens, alone.
