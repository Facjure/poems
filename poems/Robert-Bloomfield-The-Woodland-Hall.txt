 (Perhaps) adapted for Music.

In our cottage, that peeps from the skirts of the wood,
 I am mistress, no mother have I;
Yet blithe are my days, for my father is good,
 And kind is my lover hard by;
They both work together beneath the green shade,
 Both woodmen, my father and Joe.
Where I've listen'd whole hours to the echo that made
 So much of a laugh or - Hall�.

From my basket at noon they expect their supply,
 And with joy from my threshold I spring;
For the woodlands I love, and the oaks waring high,
 And Echo that sings as I sing.
Though deep shades delight me, yet love is my food,
 As I call the dear name of my Joe;
His musical shout is the pride of the wood,
 And my heart leaps to hear the - Hall�.

Simple flowers of the grove, little birds live at ease,
 I wish not to wander from you;
I'll still dwell beneath the deep roar of your trees,
 For I know that my Joe will be true.
The trill of the robin, the coo of the dove,
 Are charms that I'll never forego;
But resting through life on the bosom of love,
 Will remember the Woodland Hall�.
