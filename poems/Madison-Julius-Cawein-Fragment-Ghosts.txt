In soft sad nights, when all the still lagoon
 Lolls in a wealth of golden radiance,
 I sit like one enchanted in a trance,
And see them 'twixt the haunted mist and moon.

Lascivious eyes 'neath snow-pale sensual brows,
 Flashing hot, killing lust, and tresses light,
 Lose, satin streaming, purple as the night,
Night when the storm sings and the forest bows.

And then, meseems, along the wild, fierce hills
 A whisper and a rustle of fleet feet,
 As if tempestuous troops of Mï¿½nads meet
To drain deep bowls and shout and have their wills.

And once I see large, lustrous limbs revealed,
 Moth-white and lawny, 'twixt sonorous trees;
 And then a song, faint as of fairy seas,
Lulls all my senses till my eyes are sealed.
