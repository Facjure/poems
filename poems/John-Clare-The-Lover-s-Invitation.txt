 Now the wheat is in the ear, and the rose is on the brere,
 And bluecaps so divinely blue, with poppies of bright scarlet hue,
 Maiden, at the close o' eve, wilt thou, dear, thy cottage leave,
 And walk with one that loves thee?

 When the even's tiny tears bead upon the grassy spears,
 And the spider's lace is wet with its pinhead blebs of dew,
 Wilt thou lay thy work aside and walk by brooklets dim descried,
 Where I delight to love thee?

 While thy footfall lightly press'd tramples by the skylark's nest,
 And the cockle's streaky eyes mark the snug place where it lies,
 Mary, put thy work away, and walk at dewy close o' day
 With me to kiss and love thee.

 There's something in the time so sweet, when lovers in the evening meet,
 The air so still, the sky so mild, like slumbers of the cradled child,
 The moon looks over fields of love, among the ivy sleeps the dove:
 To see thee is to love thee.
