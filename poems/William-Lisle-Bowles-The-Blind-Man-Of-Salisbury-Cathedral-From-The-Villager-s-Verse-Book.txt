 There is a poor blind man, who, every day,
 In summer sunshine, or in winter's rain,
 Duly as tolls the bell, to the high fane
 Explores, with faltering footsteps, his dark way,
 To kneel before his Maker, and to hear
 The chaunted service, pealing full and clear.
 Ask why alone in the same spot he kneels
 Through the long year. Oh, the wide world is cold,
 As dark, to him! Here he no longer feels
 His sad bereavement. Faith and Hope uphold
 His heart; he feels not he is poor and blind,
 Amid the unpitying tumult of his mind.
 As through the aisles the choral anthems roll,
 His soul is in the choirs above the skies,
 And songs far off of angel companies,
 When this dim earth hath perished like a scroll.
 Oh! happy if the rich, the vain, the proud - 
 The plumed actors in life's motley crowd - 
 Since pride is dust, and life itself a span,
 Would learn one lesson from a poor blind man!
