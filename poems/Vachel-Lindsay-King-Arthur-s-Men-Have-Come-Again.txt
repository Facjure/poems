title: King Arthur's Men Have Come Again

[Written while a field-worker in the Anti-Saloon League of Illinois.]


King Arthur's men have come again.
They challenge everywhere
The foes of Christ's Eternal Church.
Her incense crowns the air.
The heathen knighthood cower and curse
To hear the bugles ring,
BUT SPEARS ARE SET, THE CHARGE IS ON,
WISE ARTHUR SHALL BE KING!

And Cromwell's men have come again,
I meet them in the street.
Stern but in this - no way of thorns
Shall snare the children's feet.
The reveling foemen wreak but waste,
A sodden poisonous band.
FIERCE CROMWELL BUILDS THE FLOWER-BRIGHT TOWNS,
AND A MORE SUNLIT LAND!

And Lincoln's men have come again.
Up from the South he flayed,
The grandsons of his foes arise
In his own cause arrayed.
They rise for freedom and clean laws
High laws, that shall endure.
OUR GOD ESTABLISHES HIS ARM
AND MAKES THE BATTLE SURE!
