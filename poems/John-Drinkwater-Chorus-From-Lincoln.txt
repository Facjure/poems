title: Chorus From 'Lincoln'
---

You who have gone gathering
 Cornflowers and meadowsweet,
Heard the hazels glancing down
 On September eves,
Seen the homeward rooks on wing
 Over fields of golden wheat,
And the silver cups that crown
 Water-lily leaves;

You who know the tenderness
 Of old men at eve-tide,
Coming from the hedgerows,
 Coming from the plough,
And the wandering caress
 Of winds upon the woodside,
When the crying yaffle goes
 Underneath the bough;

You who mark the flowing
 Of sap upon the May-time,
And the waters welling
 From the watershed,
You who count the growing
 Of harvest and hay-time,
Knowing these the telling
 Of your daily bread;

You who cherish courtesy
 With your fellows at your gate,
And about your hearthstone sit
 Under love's decrees,
You who know that death will be
 Speaking with you soon or late,
Kinsmen, what is mother-wit
 But the light of these?

Knowing these, what is there more
 For learning in your little years?
Are not these all gospels bright
 Shining on your day?
How then shall your hearts be sore
 With envy and her brood of fears,
How forget the words of light
 From the mountain-way ...

Blessed are the merciful ...
 Does not every threshold seek
Meadows and the flight of birds
 For compassion still?
Blessed are the merciful ...
 Are we pilgrims yet to speak
Out of Olivet the words
 Of knowledge and good-will?
