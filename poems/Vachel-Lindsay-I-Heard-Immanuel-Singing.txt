title: I Heard Immanuel Singing
---

(The poem shows the Master, with his work done, singing to free his heart in Heaven.)

This poem is intended to be half said, half sung, very softly, to the well-known tune: - 

 "Last night I lay a-sleeping,
 There came a dream so fair,
 I stood in Old Jerusalem
 Beside the temple there, - " etc.

Yet this tune is not to be fitted on, arbitrarily.It is here given to suggest the manner of handling rather than determine it.


 # To be sung. #
 I heard Immanuel singing
 Within his own good lands,
 I saw him bend above his harp.
 I watched his wandering hands
 Lost amid the harp-strings;
 Sweet, sweet I heard him play.
 His wounds were altogether healed.
 Old things had passed away.

 All things were new, but music.
 The blood of David ran
 Within the Son of David,
 Our God, the Son of Man.
 He was ruddy like a shepherd.
 His bold young face, how fair.
 Apollo of the silver bow
 Had not such flowing hair.

 # To be read very softly, but in spirited response. #
 I saw Immanuel singing
 On a tree-girdled hill.
 The glad remembering branches
 Dimly echoed still
 The grand new song proclaiming
 The Lamb that had been slain.
 New-built, the Holy City
 Gleamed in the murmuring plain.

 The crowning hours were over.
 The pageants all were past.
 Within the many mansions
 The hosts, grown still at last,
 In homes of holy mystery
 Slept long by crooning springs
 Or waked to peaceful glory,
 A universe of Kings.

 # To be sung. #
 He left his people happy.
 He wandered free to sigh
 Alone in lowly friendship
 With the green grass and the sky.
 He murmured ancient music
 His red heart burned to sing
 Because his perfect conquest
 Had grown a weary thing.

 No chant of gilded triumph - 
 His lonely song was made
 Of Art's deliberate freedom;
 Of minor chords arrayed
 In soft and shadowy colors
 That once were radiant flowers: - 
 The Rose of Sharon, bleeding
 In Olive-shadowed bowers: - 

 And all the other roses
 In the songs of East and West
 Of love and war and worshipping,
 And every shield and crest
 Of thistle or of lotus
 Or sacred lily wrought
 In creeds and psalms and palaces
 And temples of white thought: - 

 # To be read very softly, yet in spirited response. #
 All these he sang, half-smiling
 And weeping as he smiled,
 Laughing, talking to his harp
 As to a new-born child: - 
 As though the arts forgotten
 But bloomed to prophecy
 These careless, fearless harp-strings,
 New-crying in the sky.
 # To be sung. #
 "When this his hour of sorrow
 For flowers and Arts of men
 Has passed in ghostly music,"
 I asked my wild heart then - 
 What will he sing to-morrow,
 What wonder, all his own
 Alone, set free, rejoicing,
 With a green hill for his throne?
 What will he sing to-morrow
 What wonder all his own
 Alone, set free, rejoicing,
 With a green hill for his throne?
