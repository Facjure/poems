title: Below Her Window
---

Where she sleeps, no moonlight shines
 No pale beam unbidden creeps.
Darkest shade the place enshrines
Where she sleeps.

Like a diamond in the deeps
 Of the rich unopened mines
There her lovely rest she keeps.

Though the jealous dark confines
 All her beauty, Love's heart leaps.
His unerring thought divines
Where she sleeps.
