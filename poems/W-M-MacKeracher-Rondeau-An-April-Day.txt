title: Rondeau: An April Day.
---

An April day, when skies are blue,
And earth rejoices to renew
 Her vernal youth by lawn and lea,
 And sap mounts upward in the tree,
And ruddy buds come bursting through;

When violets of tender hue
And trilliums keep the morning dew
 Through all the sweet forenoon - give me
An April day;

When surly Winter's roystering crew
Have said the last of their adieux,
 And left the fettered river free,
 And buoyant hope and ecstasy
Of life awake, my wants are few -
An April day.
