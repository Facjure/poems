A Doll in the doll-maker�s house
Looks at the cradle and balls:
�That is an insult to us.�
But the oldest of all the dolls
Who had seen, being kept for show,
Generations of his sort,
Out-screams the whole shelf: �Although
There�s not a man can report
Evil of this place,
The man and the woman bring
Hither to our disgrace,
A noisy and filthy thing.�
Hearing him groan and stretch
The doll-maker�s wife is aware
Her husband has heard the wretch,
And crouched by the arm of his chair,
She murmurs into his ear,
Head upon shoulder leant:
�My dear, my dear, oh dear,
It was an accident.�
