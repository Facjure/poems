(To A.E.)


I hear a sudden cry of pain!
 There is a rabbit in a snare:
Now I hear the cry again,
 But I cannot tell from where.

But I cannot tell from where
 He is calling out for aid;
Crying on the frightened air,
 Making everything afraid.

Making everything afraid,
 Wrinkling up his little face,
As he cries again for aid;
 And I cannot find the place!

And I cannot find the place
 Where his paw is in the snare:
Little one! Oh, little one!
 I am searching everywhere.
