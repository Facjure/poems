One 's the pictur' of his Pa,
And the other of her Ma - 
Jes the bossest pair o' babies 'at a mortal ever saw!
And we love 'em as the bees
Loves the blossoms of the trees,
A-ridin' and a-rompin' in the breeze!

One's got her Mammy's eyes - 
Soft and blue as Apurl-skies - 
With the same sort of a smile, like - Yes,
and mouth about her size, - 
Dimples, too, in cheek and chin,
'At my lips jes wallers in,
A-goin' to work, er gittin' home agin.

And the other - Well, they say
That he's got his Daddy's way
O' bein' ruther soberfied, er ruther extry gay, - 
That he either cries his best,
Er he laughs his howlin'est - 
Like all he lacked was buttons and a vest!

Look at her! - and look at him! - 
Talk about yer "Cheru-bim!"
Roll 'em up in dreams together, rosy arm and chubby limb!
O we love 'em as the bees
Loves the blossoms of the trees,
A-ridin' and a-rompin' in the breeze!
