 He sits. Upon the kingly head doth rest
The round-balled wimple, and the heavy rings
Touch on the shoulders where the shadow clings.
 The downward garment shows the ambiguous breast;
 The face - that face one scarce can look on lest
One learn the secret of unspeakable things;
But the dread gaze descends with shudderings,
 To the veiled couched knees, the hands and thumbs close-pressed.
 O lidded, downcast eyes that bear the weight
Of all our woes and terrible wrong's increase:
Proud nostrils, lips proud-perfecter than these,
 With what a soul within you do you wait!
 Disdain and pity, love late-born of hate,
Passion eternal, patience, pain and peace!
