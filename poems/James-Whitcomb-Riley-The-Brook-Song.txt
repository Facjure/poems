Little brook! Little brook!
You have such a happy look -
Such a very merry manner, as you swerve and
 curve and crook -
 And your ripples, one and one,
 Reach each other's hands and run
Like laughing little children in the sun!

 Little brook, sing to me:
 Sing about a bumblebee
That tumbled from a lily-bell and grumbled
mumblingly,
 Because he wet the film
 Of his wings, and had to swim,
While the water-bugs raced round and
laughed at him!

 Little brook-sing a song
 Of a leaf that sailed along
Down the golden-braided centre of your current
 swift and strong,
 And a dragon-fly that lit
 On the tilting rim of it,
And rode away and wasn't scared a bit.

 And sing - how oft in glee
 Came a truant boy like me,
Who loved to lean and listen to your lilting
melody,
 Till the gurgle and refrain
 Of your music in his brain
Wrought a happiness as keen to him
 as pain.

Little brook-laugh and leap!
Do not let the dreamer weep:
Sing him all the songs of summer till he sink in
 softest sleep;
And then sing soft and low
Through his dreams of long ago -
 Sing back to him the rest he used to
 know!
