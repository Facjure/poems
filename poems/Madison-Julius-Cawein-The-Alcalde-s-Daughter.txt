The times they had kissed and parted
 That night were over a score;
Each time that the cavalier started,
 Each time she would swear him o'er,

"Thou art going to Barcelona! 
 To make Naxera thy bride!
Seduce the Lady Y�na! 
 And thy lips have lied! have lied!

"I love thee! I love thee, thou knowest!
 And thou shalt not give away
The love to my life thou owest;
 And my heart commands thee stay! 

"I say thou hast lied and liest! 
 For where is there war in the state? 
Thou goest, by Heaven the highest!
 To choose thee a fairer mate.

"Wilt thou go to Barcelona
 When thy queen in Toledo is?
To wait on the haughty Y�na,
 When thou hast these lips to kiss?"

And they stood in the balcony over
 The old Toledo square:
And weeping she took for her lover
 A red rose out of her hair.

And they kissed farewell; and higher
 The moon made amber the air:
And she drew for the traitor and liar
 A stiletto out of her hair....

When the night-watch lounged through the quiet
 With the stir of halberds and swords,
Not a bravo was there to defy it,
 Not a gallant to brave with words.

One man, at the corner's turning,
 Quite dead. And they stoop or stand 
In his heart a dagger burning,
 And a red rose crushed in his hand.
