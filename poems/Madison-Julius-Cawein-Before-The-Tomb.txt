 The way went under cedared gloom
 To moonlight, like a cactus bloom,
 Before the entrance of her tomb.

 I had an hour of night and thin
 Sad starlight; and I set my chin
 Against the grating and looked in.

 A gleam, like moonlight, through a square
 Of opening, I knew not where 
 Shone on her coffin resting there.

 And on its oval silver-plate
 I read her name and age and date,
 And smiled, soft-thinking on my hate.

 There was no insect sound to chirr;
 No wind to make a little stir.
 I stood and looked and thought on her.

 The gleam stole downward from her head,
 Till at her feet it rested red
 On Gothic gold, that sadly said: 

 "God to her love lent a weak reed
 Of strength: and gave no light to lead:
 Pray for her soul; for it hath need."

 There was no night-bird's twitter near,
 No low vague water I might hear
 To make a small sound in the ear.

 The gleam, that made a burning mark
 Of each dim word, died to a spark;
 Then left the tomb and coffin dark.

 I had a little while to wait;
 And prayed with hands against the grate,
 And heart that yearned and knew too late.

 There was no light below, above,
 To point my soul the way thereof, 
 The way of hate that led to love.
