 Was it for nothing in the years gone by,
O my love, O my friend,
 You thrilled me with your noble words of faith? - 
 Hope beyond life, and love, love beyond death!
 Yet now I shudder, and yet you did not die,
O my friend, O my love!

 Was it for nothing in the dear dead years,
O my love, O my friend,
 I kissed you when you wrung my heart from me,
 And gave my stubborn hand where trust might be?
 Yet then I smiled, and see, these bitter tears,
O my friend, O my love!

 No bitter words to say to you have I,
O my love, O my friend!
 That faith, that hope, that love was mine, not yours!
 And yet that kiss, that clasp endures, endures.
 I have no bitter words to say. Good-bye,
O my friend, O my love!
