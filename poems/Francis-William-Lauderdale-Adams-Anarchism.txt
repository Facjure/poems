 'Tis not when I am here,
In these homeless homes,
 Where sin and shame and disease
And foul death comes;

 'Tis not when heart and brain
Would be still and forget
 Men and women and children
Dragged down to the pit:

 But when I hear them declaiming
Of "liberty," "order," and "law,"
 The husk-hearted gentleman
And the mud-hearted bourgeois,

 That a sombre hateful desire
Burns up slow in my breast
 To wreck the great guilty temple,
And give us rest!
