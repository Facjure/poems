1

Hangs stormed with stars the night,
 Deep over deep,
A majesty, a might,
 To feel and keep.


2

Ah! what is such and such,
 Love, canst thou tell?
That shrinks - though 'tis not much - 
 To weep farewell.


3

That hates the dawn and lark;
 Would have the wail, - 
Sobbed through the ceaseless dark, - 
 O' the nightingale.


4

Yes, earth, thy life were worth
 Not much to me,
Were there not after earth
 Eternity.


5

God gave thee life to keep - 
 And what hath life? - 
Love, faith, and care, and sleep
 Where dreams are rife.


6

Death's sleep, whose shadows start
 The tears in eyes
Of love, that fill the heart
 That breaks and dies.


7

And faith is never given
 Without some care,
That leadeth us to heaven
 By ways of prayer.


8

The nightingale and dark
 Are thine then here;
Beyond, the light and lark
 Eternal there.
