TO MY LOST BROTHER


Ships the angry sea is lashing;
But I launch my little bark,
Though the thunder peals are crashing,
And the sea is pitchy dark!
See by lightning's vivid flashing
How to shift my tattered sail - 
Far across the billows dashing,
I am floating with the gale.

CHORUS

Floating, floating, floating ever
On the stormy deep blue sea,
Far from father and dear mother
And, true love, away from thee!
Go, ye zephyrs, sweetly laden,
Cheer my loved ones in their wail;
Tell my wee sweet bright-eyed maiden
I am floating with the gale!

When the siren maids are waking,
And are singing wild sea songs,
Dear, they start my heart to aching,
For its love to thee belongs.
Now my love-lorn soul is shaking
With a spell of bitter wail,
And my heart is sadly breaking,
For I'm floating with the gale!

CHORUS

Now my hopes are fading ever,
Gloom is chasing 'way the bliss;
Dear, I know that I can never
Come thy ruby lips to kiss!
But my heart will cling forever
To that love I oft did hail,
For those ties I can not sever,
Though I'm floating with the gale!

CHORUS

Dear, my heart is ever longing,
Longs surfmen my bark to save;
Through my brain these thoughts are thronging,
Of a grave beneath the wave;
Of loved ones my heart is wronging,
And the belly of the whale;
'Round my soul their ghosts are thronging,
As I'm floating with the gale!

CHORUS

Dear, I fain would be returning
To the cove just where thou art,
While my languid breast is burning
Light and love full out my heart!
But cruel Fate my hopes is spurning,
And winds blow against my sail;
While out Death my life is burning,
I'm still floating with the gale!

CHORUS
