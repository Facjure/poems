title: He Abjures Love

At last I put off love,
 For twice ten years
The daysman of my thought,
 And hope, and doing;
Being ashamed thereof,
 And faint of fears
And desolations, wrought
In his pursuing,

Since first in youthtime those
 Disquietings
That heart-enslavement brings
 To hale and hoary,
Became my housefellows,
 And, fool and blind,
I turned from kith and kind
 To give him glory.

I was as children be
 Who have no care;
I did not shrink or sigh,
 I did not sicken;
But lo, Love beckoned me,
 And I was bare,
And poor, and starved, and dry,
 And fever-stricken.

Too many times ablaze
 With fatuous fires,
Enkindled by his wiles
 To new embraces,
Did I, by wilful ways
 And baseless ires,
Return the anxious smiles
 Of friendly faces.

No more will now rate I
 The common rare,
The midnight drizzle dew,
 The gray hour golden,
The wind a yearning cry,
 The faulty fair,
Things dreamt, of comelier hue
 Than things beholden! . . .

 - I speak as one who plumbs
 Life's dim profound,
One who at length can sound
 Clear views and certain.
But - after love what comes?
 A scene that lours,
A few sad vacant hours,
 And then, the Curtain.

1883.
