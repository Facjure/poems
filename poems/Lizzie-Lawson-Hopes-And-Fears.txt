title: Hopes And Fears.
---

Like clouds that flit across the sky,
So follow hopes and fears.
What in these clouds see you and me
Dear Sweetheart, smiles or tears?

This little airy fleecy wing,
That flits across the blue,
What message Sweetheart does it bring
Of hope or fear to you?

Pray God it brings you sunny hours
And haply some few tears
To bless like showers your summer flowers
In the long coming years.
