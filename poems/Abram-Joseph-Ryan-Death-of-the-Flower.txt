I love my mother, the wildwood,
 I sleep upon her breast;
A day or two of childhood,
 And then I sink to rest.

I had once a lovely sister --
 She was cradled by my side;
But one Summer day I missed her --
 She had gone to deck a bride.

And I had another sister,
 With cheeks all bright with bloom;
And another morn I missed her --
 She had gone to wreathe a tomb.

And they told me they had withered,
 On the bride's brow and the grave;
Half an hour, and all their fragrance
 Died away, which heaven gave.

Two sweet-faced girls came walking
 Thro' my lonely home one day,
And I overheard them talking
 Of an altar on their way.

They were culling flowers around me,
 And I said a little prayer
To go with them -- and they found me --
 And upon an altar fair,

Where the Eucharist was lying
 On its mystical death-bed,
I felt myself a-dying,
 While the Mass was being said.

But I lived a little longer,
 And I prayed there all the day,
Till the evening Benediction,
 When my poor life passed away.
