The church bells were ringing, the devil sat singing
 On the stump of a rotting old tree;
'Oh faith it grows cold, and the creeds they grow old,
 And the world is nigh ready for me.'

The bells went on ringing, a spirit came singing,
 And smiled as he crumbled the tree;
'Yon wood does but perish new seedlings to cherish,
 And the world is too live yet for thee.'

Eversley, 1848.
