 Heigh-ho! Babyhood! Tell me where you linger:
Let's toddle home again, for we have gone astray;
 Take this eager hand of mine and lead me by the finger
Back to the Lotus lands of the far-away.

 Turn back the leaves of life; don't read the story, -
Let's find the pictures, and fancy all the rest: -
 We can fill the written pages with a brighter glory
Than Old Time, the story-teller, at his very best!

 Turn to the brook, where the honeysuckle, tipping
O'er its vase of perfume spills it on the breeze,
 And the bee and humming-bird in ecstacy are sipping
From the fairy flagons of the blooming locust trees.

 Turn to the lane, where we used to "teeter-totter,"
Printing little foot-palms in the mellow mold,
 Laughing at the lazy cattle wading in the water
Where the ripples dimple round the buttercups of gold:

 Where the dusky turtle lies basking on the gravel
Of the sunny sandbar in the middle-tide,
 And the ghostly dragonfly pauses in his travel
To rest like a blossom where the water-lily died.

 Heigh-ho! Babyhood! Tell me where you linger:
Let's toddle home again, for we have gone astray;
 Take this eager hand of mine and lead me by the finger
Back to the Lotus lands of the far-away.
