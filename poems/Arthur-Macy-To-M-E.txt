 We keep in step as years roll by;
You march behind and I before: - 
 The path is new to you; but I
Have passed the ground you're walking o'er.
 Yet I march on with measured tread,
And looking back, I smile and greet you: - 
 I fear the order, "Halt!" Instead,
Would I might countermarch and meet you.
