title: It All Will Come Out Right
---

Whatever is a cruel wrong,
 Whatever is unjust,
The honest years that speed along
 Will trample in the dust.
In restless youth I railed at fate
 With all my puny might,
But now I know if I but wait
 It all will come out right.

Though Vice may don the judge's gown
 And play the censor's part,
And Fact be cowed by Falsehood's frown
 And Nature ruled by art;
Though Labour toils through blinding tears
 And idle Wealth is might,
I know the honest, earnest years
 Will bring it all out right.

Though poor and loveless creeds may pass
 For pure religion's gold;
Though ignorance may rule the mass
 While truth meets glances cold,
I know a law complete, sublime,
 Controls us with its might,
And in God's own appointed time
 It all will come out right.
