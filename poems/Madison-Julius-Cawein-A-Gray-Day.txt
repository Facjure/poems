I.

 Long vollies of wind and of rain
And the rain on the drizzled pane,
And the eve falls chill and murk;
 But on yesterday's eve I know
 How a horned moon's thorn-like bow
 Stabbed rosy thro' gold and thro' glow,
Like a rich barbaric dirk.


II.

 Now thick throats of the snapdragons, - 
 Who hold in their hues cool dawns,
Which a healthy yellow paints, - 
 Are filled with a sweet rain fine
 Of a jaunty, jubilant shine,
 A faery vat of rare wine,
Which the honey thinly taints.


III.

 Now dabble the poppies shrink,
 And the coxcomb and the pink;
While the candytuft's damp crown
 Droops dribbled, low bowed i' the wet;
 And long spikes o' the mignonette
 Little musk-sacks open set,
Which the dripping o' dew drags down.


IV.

 Stretched taunt on the blades of grass,
 Like a gossamer-fibered glass,
Which the garden-spider spun,
 The web, where the round rain clings
 In its middle sagging, swings; - 
 A hammock for Elfin things
When the stars succeed the sun.


V.

 And mark, where the pale gourd grows
 Up high as the clambering rose,
How that tiger-moth is pressed
 To the wide leaf's underside. - 
 And I know where the red wasps hide,
 And the wild bees, - who defied
The first strong gusts, - distressed.


VI.

 Yet I feel that the gray will blow
 Aside for an afterglow;
And a breeze on a sudden toss
 Drenched boughs to a pattering show'r
 Athwart the red dusk in a glow'r,
 Big drops heard hard on each flow'r
On the grass and the flowering moss.


VII.

 And then for a minute, may be, - 
 A pearl - hollow worn - of the sea, - 
A glimmer of moon will smile;
 Cool stars rinsed clean on the dusk,
 A freshness of gathering musk
 O'er the showery lawns, as brusk
As spice from an Indian isle.
