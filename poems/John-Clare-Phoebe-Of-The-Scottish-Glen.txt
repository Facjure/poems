 Agen I'll take my idle pen
 And sing my bonny mountain maid--
 Sweet Phoebe of the Scottish glen,
 Nor of her censure feel afraid.
 I'll charm her ear with beauty's praise,
 And please her eye with songs agen--
 The ballads of our early days--
 To Phoebe of the Scottish glen.

 There never was a fairer thing
 All Scotland's glens and mountains through.
 The siller gowans of the Spring,
 Besprent with pearls of mountain dew,
 The maiden blush upon the brere,
 Far distant from the haunts of men,
 Are nothing half so sweet or dear
 As Phoebe of the Scottish glen.

 How handsome is her naked foot,
 Moist with the pearls of Summer dew:
 The siller daisy's nothing to 't,
 Nor hawthorn flowers so white to view,
 She's sweeter than the blooming brere,
 That blossoms far away from men:
 No flower in Scotland's half so dear
 As Phoebe of the Scottish glen.
