 It's slim and trim and bound in blue;
 Its leaves are crisp and edged with gold;
 Its words are simple, stalwart too;
 Its thoughts are tender, wise and bold.
 Its pages scintillate with wit;
 Its pathos clutches at my throat:
 Oh, how I love each line of it!
 That Little Book I Never Wrote.

 In dreams I see it praised and prized
 By all, from plowman unto peer;
 It's pencil-marked and memorized,
 It's loaned (and not returned, I fear);
 It's worn and torn and travel-tossed,
 And even dusky natives quote
 That classic that the world has lost,
 The Little Book I Never Wrote.

 Poor ghost! For homes you've failed to cheer,
 For grieving hearts uncomforted,
 Don't haunt me now. . . . Alas! I fear
 The fire of Inspiration's dead.
 A humdrum way I go to-night,
 From all I hoped and dreamed remote:
 Too late . . . a better man must write
 That Little Book I Never Wrote.
