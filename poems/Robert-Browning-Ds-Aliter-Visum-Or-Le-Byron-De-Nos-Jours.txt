I.
Stop, let me have the truth of that!
Is that all true? I say, the day
Ten years ago when both of us
Met on a morning, friends as thus
We meet this evening, friends or what?

II.
Did you because I took your arm
And sillily smiled, �A mass of brass
That sea looks, blazing underneath!�
While up the cliff-road edged with heath,
We took the turns nor came to harm

III.
Did you consider �Now makes twice
�That I have seen her, walked and talked
�With this poor pretty thoughtful thing,
�Whose worth I weigh: she tries to sing;
�Draws, hopes in time the eye grows nice;

IV.
�Reads verse and thinks she understands;
�Loves all, at any rate, that�s great,
�Good, beautiful; but much as we
�Down at the bath-house love the sea,
�Who breathe its salt and bruise its sands:

V.
�While . . . do but follow the fishing-gull
�That flaps and floats from wave to cave!
�There�s the sea-lover, fair my friend!
�What then? Be patient, mark and mend!
�Had you the making of your scull?�

VI.
And did you, when we faced the church
With spire and sad slate roof, aloof
From human fellowship so far,
Where a few graveyard crosses are,
And garlands for the swallows� perch,

VII.
Did you determine, as we stepped
O�er the lone stone fence, �Let me get
�Her for myself, and what�s the earth
�With all its art, verse, music, worth
�Compared with love, found, gained, and kept?

VIII.
�Schumann�s our music-maker now;
�Has his march-movement youth and mouth?
�Ingres�s the modern man that paints;
�Which will lean on me, of his saints?
�Heine for songs; for kisses, how?�

IX.
And did you, when we entered, reached
The votive frigate, soft aloft
Riding on air this hundred years,
Safe-smiling at old hopes and fears,
Did you draw profit while she preached?

X.
Resolving, �Fools we wise men grow!
�Yes, I could easily blurt out curt
�Some question that might find reply
�As prompt in her stopped lips, dropped eye,
�And rush of red to cheek and brow:

XI.
�Thus were a match made, sure and fast,
��Mid the blue weed-flowers round the mound
�Where, issuing, we shall stand and stay
�For one more look at baths and bay,
�Sands, sea-gulls, and the old church last

XII.
�A match �twixt me, bent, wigged and lamed,
�Famous, however, for verse and worse,
�Sure of the Fortieth spare Arm-chair
�When gout and glory seat me there,
�So, one whose love-freaks pass unblamed,

XIII.
�And this young beauty, round and sound
�As a mountain-apple, youth and truth
�With loves and doves, at all events
�With money in the Three per Cents;
�Whose choice of me would seem profound:

XIV.
�She might take me as I take her.
�Perfect the hour would pass, alas!
�Climb high, love high, what matter? Still,
�Feet, feelings, must descend the hill:
�An hour�s perfection can�t recur.

XV.
�Then follows Paris and full time
�For both to reason: �Thus with us!�
�She�ll sigh, �Thus girls give body and soul
��At first word, think they gain the goal,
��When �t is the starting-place they climb!

XVI.
��My friend makes verse and gets renown;
��Have they all fifty years, his peers?
�He knows the world, firm, quiet and gay;
��Boys will become as much one day:
��They�re fools; he cheats, with beard less brown.

XVII.
��For boys say, Love one or I die!
��He did not say, The truth is, youth
��I want, who am old and know too much;
��I�d catch youth: lend one sight and touch!
��Drop heart�s blood where life�s wheels grate dry!

XVIII.
�While I should make rejoinder� (then
It was, no doubt, you ceased that least
Light pressure of my arm in yours)
��I can conceive of cheaper cures
��For a yawning-fit o�er books and men.

XIX.
��What? All I am, was, and might be,
��All, books taught, art brought, life�s whole strife,
��Painful results since precious, just
��Were fitly exchanged, in wise disgust,
��For two cheeks freshened by youth and sea?

XX.
��All for a nosegay! what came first;
��With fields on flower, untried each side;
��I rally, need my books and men,
��And find a nosegay�: drop it, then,
��No match yet made for best or worst!�

XXI.
That ended me. You judged the porch
We left by, Norman; took our look
At sea and sky; wondered so few
Find out the place for air and view;
Remarked the sun began to scorch;

XXII.
Descended, soon regained the baths,
And then, good-bye! Years ten since then:
Ten years! We meet: you tell me, now,
By a window-seat for that cliff-brow,
On carpet-stripes for those sand-paths.

XXIII.
Now I may speak: you fool, for all
Your lore! WHO made things plain in vain?
What was the sea for? What, the grey
Sad church, that solitary day,
Crosses and graves and swallows� call?

XXIV.
Was there nought better than to enjoy?
No feat which, done, would make time break
And let us pent-up creatures through
Into eternity, our due?
No forcing earth teach heaven�s employ?

XXV.
No wise beginning, here and now,
What cannot grow complete (earth�s feat)
And heaven must finish, there and then?
No tasting earth�s true food for men,
Its sweet in sad, its sad in sweet?

XXVI.
No grasping at love, gaining a share
O� the sole spark from God�s life at strife
With death, so, sure of range above
The limits here? For us and love,
Failure; but, when God fails, despair.

XXVII.
This you call wisdom? Thus you add
Good unto good again, in vain?
You loved, with body worn and weak;
I loved, with faculties to seek:
Were both loves worthless since ill-clad?

XXVIII.
Let the mere star-fish in his vault
Crawl in a wash of weed, indeed,
Rose-jacynth to the finger-tips:
He, whole in body and soul, outstrips
Man, found with either in default.

XXIX.
But what�s whole, can increase no more,
Is dwarfed and dies, since here�s its sphere.
The devil laughed at you in his sleeve!
You knew not? That I well believe;
Or you had saved two souls: nay, four.

XXX.
For Stephanie sprained last night her wrist,
Ankle or something. �Pooh,� cry you?
At any rate she danced, all say,
Vilely; her vogue has had its day.
Here comes my husband from his whist.
