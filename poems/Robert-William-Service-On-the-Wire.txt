 O God, take the sun from the sky!
 It's burning me, scorching me up.
 God, can't You hear my cry?
 'Water! A poor, little cup!'
 It's laughing, the cursed sun!
 See how it swells and swells
 Fierce as a hundred hells!
 God, will it never have done?
 It's searing the flesh on my bones;
 It's beating with hammers red
 My eyeballs into my head;
 It's parching my very moans.
 See! It's the size of the sky,
 And the sky is a torrent of fire,
 Foaming on me as I lie
 Here on the wire . . . the wire. . . .

 Of the thousands that wheeze and hum
 Heedlessly over my head,
 Why can't a bullet come,
 Pierce to my brain instead,
 Blacken forever my brain,
 Finish forever my pain?
 Here in the hellish glare
 Why must I suffer so?
 Is it God doesn't care?
 Is it God doesn't know?
 Oh, to be killed outright,
 Clean in the clash of the fight!
 That is a golden death,
 That is a boon; but this . . .
 Drawing an anguished breath
 Under a hot abyss,
 Under a stooping sky
 Of seething, sulphurous fire,
 Scorching me up as I lie
 Here on the wire . . . the wire. . . .

 Hasten, O God, Thy night!
 Hide from my eyes the sight
 Of the body I stare and see
 Shattered so hideously.
 I can't believe that it's mine.
 My body was white and sweet,
 Flawless and fair and fine,
 Shapely from head to feet;
 Oh no, I can never be
 The thing of horror I see
 Under the rifle fire,
 Trussed on the wire . . . the wire. . . .

 Of night and of death I dream;
 Night that will bring me peace,
 Coolness and starry gleam,
 Stillness and death's release:
 Ages and ages have passed, - 
 Lo! it is night at last.
 Night! but the guns roar out.
 Night! but the hosts attack.
 Red and yellow and black
 Geysers of doom upspout.
 Silver and green and red
 Star-shells hover and spread.
 Yonder off to the right
 Fiercely kindles the fight;
 Roaring near and more near,
 Thundering now in my ear;
 Close to me, close . . . Oh, hark!
 Someone moans in the dark.
 I hear, but I cannot see,
 I hear as the rest retire,
 Someone is caught like me,
 Caught on the wire . . . the wire. . . .

 Again the shuddering dawn,
 Weird and wicked and wan;
 Again, and I've not yet gone.
 The man whom I heard is dead.
 Now I can understand:
 A bullet hole in his head,
 A pistol gripped in his hand.
 Well, he knew what to do, - 
 Yes, and now I know too. . . .

 Hark the resentful guns!
 Oh, how thankful am I
 To think my beloved ones
 Will never know how I die!
 I've suffered more than my share;
 I'm shattered beyond repair;
 I've fought like a man the fight,
 And now I demand the right
 (God! how his fingers cling!)
 To do without shame this thing.
 Good! there's a bullet still;
 Now I'm ready to fire;
 Blame me, God, if You will,
 Here on the wire . . . the wire. . . .
