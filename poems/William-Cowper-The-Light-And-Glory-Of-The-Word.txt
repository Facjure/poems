title: The Light And Glory Of The Word.
---

The Spirit breathes upon the Word,
And brings the truth to sight;
Precepts and promises afford
A sanctifying light.


A glory gilds the sacred page,
Majestic like the sun;
It gives a light to every age,
It gives, but borrows none.


The hand that gave it still supplies
The gracious light and heat:
His truths upon the nations rise,
They rise, but never set.


Let everlasting thanks be thine,
For such a bright display,
As makes a world of darkness shine
With beams of heavenly day.


My soul rejoices to pursue
The steps of him I love,
Till glory breaks upon my view
In brighter worlds above.
