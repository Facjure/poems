June 4th! Do you know what that date means?
June 4th! By this air and these pines!
Well, only you know how I hate scenes,
These might be my very last lines!
For perhaps, sir, you�ll kindly remember
If some other things you�ve forgot
That you last wrote the 4th of december,
Just six months ago! from this spot;

From this spot, that you said was �the fairest
For once being held in my thought.�
Now, really I call that the barest
Of well, I won�t say what I ought!
For here I am back from my �riches,�
My �triumphs,� my �tours,� and all that;
And you�re not to be found in the ditches
Or temples of Poverty Flat!

From Paris we went for the season
To London, when Pa wired, �Stop.�
Mama says �his health� was the reason.
(I�ve heard that some things took a �drop.�)
But she said if my patience I�d summon
I could go back with him to the Flat
Perhaps I was thinking of some one
Who of me well was not thinking that!

Of course you will say that I �never
Replied to the letter you wrote.�
That is just like a man! But, however,
I read it or how could I quote?
And as to the stories you�ve heard (No,
Don�t tell me you haven�t I know!),
You�ll not believe one blessed word, Joe;
But just whence they came, let them go!

And they came from Sade Lotski of Yolo,
Whose father sold clothes on the Bar
You called him Job-lotski, you know, Joe,
And the boys said her value was par.
Well, we met her in Paris just flaring
With diamonds, and lost in a hat
And she asked me �how Joseph was faring
In his love-suit on Poverty Flat!�

She thought it would shame me! I met her
With a look, Joe, that made her eyes drop;
And I said that your �love-suit fared better
Than any suit out of their shop!�
And I didn�t blush then as I�m doing
To find myself here, all alone,
And left, Joe, to do all the �sueing�
To a lover that�s certainly flown.

In this brand-new hotel, called �The Lily�
(I wonder who gave it that name?)
I really am feeling quite silly,
To think I was once called the same;
And I stare from its windows, and fancy
I�m labeled to each passer-by.
Ah! gone is the old necromancy,
For nothing seems right to my eye.

On that hill there are stores that I knew not;
There�s a street where I once lost my way;
And the copse where you once tied my shoe-knot
Is shamelessly open as day!
And that bank by the spring I once drank there,
And you called the place Eden, you know;
Now I�m banished like Eve though the bank there
Is belonging to �Adams and Co.�

There�s the rustle of silk on the sidewalk;
Just now there passed by a tall hat;
But there�s gloom in this �boom� and this wild talk
Of the �future� of Poverty Flat.
There�s a decorous chill in the air, Joe,
Where once we were simple and free;
And I hear they�ve been making a mayor, Joe,
Of the man who shot Sandy McGee.

But there�s still the �lap, lap� of the river;
There�s the song of the pines, deep and low.
(How my longing for them made me quiver
In the park that they call Fontainebleau!)
There�s the snow-peak that looked on our dances,
And blushed when the morning said, �Go!�
There�s a lot that remains which one fancies
But somehow there�s never a Joe!

Perhaps, on the whole, it is better,
For you might have been changed like the rest;
Though it�s strange that I�m trusting this letter
To papa, just to have it addressed.
He thinks he may find you, and really
Seems kinder now I�m all alone.
You might have been here, Joe, if merely
To look what I�m willing to own.

Well, well! that�s all past; so good-night, Joe;
Good-night to the river and Flat;
Good-night to what�s wrong and what�s right, Joe;
Good-night to the past, and all that
To Harrison�s barn, and its dancers;
To the moon, and the white peak of snow;
And good-night to the canyon that answers
My �Joe!� with its echo of �No!�

P.S.

I�ve just got your note. You deceiver!
How dared you how could you? Oh, Joe!
To think I�ve been kept a believer
In things that were six months ago!
And it�s you�ve built this house, and the bank, too,
And the mills, and the stores, and all that!
And for everything changed I must thank you,
Who have �struck it� on Poverty Flat!

How dared you get rich you great stupid!
Like papa, and some men that I know,
Instead of just trusting to Cupid
And to me for your money? Ah, Joe!
Just to think you sent never a word, dear,
Till you wrote to papa for consent!
Now I know why they had me transferred here,
And �the health of papa� what that meant!

Now I know why they call this �The Lily;�
Why the man who shot Sandy McGee
You made mayor! �Twas because oh, you silly!
He once �went down the middle� with me!
I�ve been fooled to the top of my bent here,
So come, and ask pardon you know
That you�ve still got to get my consent, dear!
And just think what that echo said Joe!
