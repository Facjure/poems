My boat is on the bounding tide,
 Away, away from surge and shore;
A waif upon the wave I ride,
 Without a rudder or an oar.

Blow as ye list, ye breezes, blow 
 The compass now is nought to me;
Flow as ye will, ye billows, flow,
 If but ye bear me out to sea.

Yon waving line of dusky blue,
 Where care and toil oppress the heart 
To thee I bid a long adieu,
 And smile to feel that thus we part.

There let the sweating ploughman toil,
 The yearning miser count his gain,
The fevered scholar waste his oil,
 But I am bounding o'er the main!

How fresh these breezes to the brow 
 How dear this freedom to the soul;
Bright ocean, I am with thee now,
 So let thy golden billows roll!

 * * * * *

But stay what means this throbbing brain 
 This heaving chest these pulses quick?
Oh, take me to the land again,
 For I am very, very sick!
