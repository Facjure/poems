title: Economy [A Valentine]

 I send,
 O sweetest friend,
 A kiss;
 Such as fair ladies gave
 Of old, when knights were brave,
 And smiles were won
 Through foes undone.
 And this will be
 For you to give again to me;
 And then, its present errand o'er,
 I'll give it unto you once more,
 Ere briefest time elapse,
 With interest, perhaps.
 Its mission spent,
 Again to me it may be lent.
 And thus, day after day,
 As we a simple law obey,
 Forever, to and fro,
 The selfsame kiss will go;
 A busy shuttle that shall weave
 A web of love, to soften and relieve
 Our daily care.
 And so,
 As thus we share,
 With lip to lip,
 Our frugal partnership,
 One kiss will always do
 For two.
 And, oh, how easy it will be
 To practice this economy!
