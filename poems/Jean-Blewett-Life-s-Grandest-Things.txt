title: Life's Grandest Things.
---

What is the greatest work of all?
The work that comes every day;
 The work that waits us on ev'ry hand
 Is work that, for us, is truly grand,
And the love of work is our pay.

What is the highest life of all?
It is living, day by day,
 True to ourselves and true to the right,
 Living the truth from dawn till the night,
And the love of truth for our pay.

What is the grandest thing of all - 
Is it winning Heaven some day?
 No, and a thousand times say no;
 'Tis making this old world thrill and glow
 With the sun of love till each shall know
 Something of Heaven here below,
And God's well done for our pay.
