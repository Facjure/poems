Raymond.

Dearest, that sit'st in dreams,
 Through the window look, this way.
How changed and desolate seems
 The world, Ida, to-day!
Heavy and low the sky is glooming:
 Winter is coming!

Ida.

My dreaming heart is stirr'd:
 Sadly the winter comes!
The wind is loud: how weird,
 Heard in these darken'd rooms!
Speak to me, Raymond; ease this dread:
 I am afraid, afraid.

Raymond.

Love, what is this? Like snow
 Thy cheeks feel, snow they wear.
What ails my darling so?
 What is it thou dost hear?
Close, close, thy soft arms cling to mine:
 Tears on thy lashes shine.

Ida.

Hark! love, the wind wails by
 The wet October trees,
Swaying them mournfully:
 The wet leaves shower and cease.
And hark! how blows the weary rain,
 Against the shaken pane.

Raymond.

Ah, yes, the world is drear
 Outside; there is no rest.
But what can Ida fear,
 Shelter'd upon my breast?
Heed not the storm-blast, beating wild,
 I love thee, love thee, child.

Ida.

Thy breath is in my hair,
 Thy kisses on my cheek;
Yet I scarce feel them there:
 Faintly I hear thee speak.
My heart is dreaming far away,
 In some sad, future day.

Raymond.

The future? In the mist
 Of years what dost thou see?
O let that dark land rest:
 Come back, come back to me!
Look up! How fix'd and vacant seem
 Thine eyes; so deep they dream.

Ida.

To leave the blessed light:
 Cold in the grave to lie!
No voice, no human sight:
 Darkness and apathy!
To die! 'tis hard, ere youth is o'er;
 But ah, to love no more!

Raymond.

What dream is this, alas!
 O, if but for my sake,
Wake, darling; let this pass:
 Ida, dear Ida, wake!
I cannot bear to see those tears:
 Thy sad tones hurt my ears.

Ida.

Will he forget me, then,
 When I am gone away?
'Twere best: to give him pain,
 Let not my memory stay.
But O, even there, in Hades dim,
 I would remember him.

Raymond.

Thou griev'st thyself in vain:
 Sweet love, be comforted.
Come, leave this world of rain;
 To the bright hearth turn thy head.
We have our fireside still, the same:
 How cheerful is the flame!

Though darkness round us press;
 Though wild, without, it blows;
Here sit thee, while thy face
 In the happy firelight glows:
Clasp'd in my arms, lie tranquil here;
 And listen, Ida dear.

As, from that outlook chill,
 The glad hearth meets our sight,
A charm for every ill
 We bear, a charm of might.
Ah, 'gainst its power not death shall stay!
 Know'st thou it, darling, say?

Thou smilest! Joy, I see,
 Dawns in thine eyes again:
Those cheeks of ivory
 Their own sweet bloom regain.
Thou know'st that heavenly charm; how well,
 Thy happy kisses tell!
