title: Twinkling Of An Eye
---

On twin tails of a comet
penguin men polka dot
the night --- 
waddle white suits
past pale the white Empress Night,
flickering graveyard stars
 - -a pitcher of inky black
upended in a choir and manger

II.
Lowing of the clouds
lowering overhead like bombardiers
rifling the Firmament,
black braying back.

III.
Millpond, satin and creamy,
then buttercup crush of waves
