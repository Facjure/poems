Its casements' diamond disks of glass
 Stare myriad on a terrace old,
Where urns, unkempt with ragged grass,
 Foam o'er with frothy cold.
The snow rounds o'er each stair of stone;
 The frozen fount is hooped with pearl;
Down desolate walks, like phantoms lone,
 Thin, powd'ry snow-wreaths whirl.

And to each rose-tree's stem that bends
 With silver snow-combs, glued with frost,
It seems each summer rosebud sends
 Its airy, scentless ghost.
The stiff Elizabethan pile
 Chatters with cold thro' all its panes,
And rumbling down each chimney file
 The mad wind shakes his reins.

*******

Lone in the Northern angle, dim
 With immemorial dust, it lay,
Where each gaunt casement's stony rim
 Stared lidless to the day.
Drear in the Northern angle, hung
 With olden arras dusky, where
Tall, shadowy Tristrams fought and sung
 For shadowy Isolds fair.

Lies by a dingy cabinet
 A tarnished lute upon the floor;
A talon-footed chair is set
 Grotesquely by the door.
A carven, testered bedstead stands
 With rusty silks draped all about;
And like a moon in murky lands
 A mirror glitters out.

Dark in the Northern angle, where
 In musty arras eats and clings
The drowsy moth; and frightened there
 The wild wind sighs and sings
Adown the roomy flue and takes
 And swings the ghostly mirror till
It shrieks and creaks, then pulls and shakes
 The curtains with a will.

A starving mouse forever gnaws
 Behind a polished panel dark,
And 'long the floor its shadow draws
 A poplar in the park.
I have been there when blades of light
 Stabbed each dull, stained, and dusty pane;
I have been there at dead of night,
 But never will again....

She grew upon my vision as
 Heat sucked from the dry summer sod;
In taffetas as green as grass
 Silent and faint she trod;
And angry jewels winked and frowned
 In serpent coils on neck and wrist,
And 'round her dainty waist was wound
 A zone of silver mist.

And icy fair as some bleak land
 Her pale, still face stormed o'er with night
Of raven tresses, and her hand
 Was beautiful and white.
Before the ebon mirror old
 Full tearfully she made her moan,
And then a cock crew far and cold;
 I looked and she was gone.

As if had come a sullying breath
 And from the limpid mirror passed,
Her presence past, like some near death
 Leaving my blood aghast.
Tho' I've been there when blades of light
 Stabbed each dull, stained, and dusty pane;
Tho' I've been there at dead of night,
 I never will again.
