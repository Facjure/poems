title: Paddy Malone In Australia

Och! my name�s Pat Malone, and I�m from Tipperary.
Sure, I don�t know it now I�m so bothered, Ohone!
And the gals that I danced with, light-hearted and airy,
It�s scarcely they�d notice poor Paddy Malone.
�Tis twelve months or more since our ship she cast anchor
In happy Australia, the Emigrant�s home,
And from that day to this there�s been nothing but canker,
And grafe and vexation for Paddy Malone.
Oh, Paddy Malone! Oh, Paddy, Ohone!
Bad luck to the agent that coaxed ye to roam.

Wid a man called a squatter I soon got a place, sure,
He�d a beard like a goat, and such whiskers, Ohone!
And he said�as he peeped through the hair on his faitures�
That he liked the appearance of Paddy Malone.
Wid him I agreed to go up to his station,
Saying abroad in the bush you�ll find yourself at home.
I liked his proposal, and �out hesitation
Signed my name wid a X that spelt Paddy Malone.
Oh, Paddy Malone, you�re no scholard, Ohone!
Sure, I made a cris-crass that spelt Paddy Malone.

A-herding my sheep in the bush, as they call it�
It was no bush at all, but a mighty great wood,
Wid all the big trees that were small bushes one time,
A long time ago, faith I �spose �fore the flood.
To find out this big bush one day I went further,
The trees grew so thick that I couldn�t, Ohone!
I tried to go back then, but that I found harder,
And bothered and lost was poor Paddy Malone.
Oh, Paddy Malone, through the bush he did roam
What a Babe in the Wood was poor Paddy Malone.

I was soon overcome, sure, wid grafe and vexation,
And camped, you must know, by the side of a log;
I was found the next day by a man from the station,
For I coo-ey�d and roared like a bull in a bog.
The man said to me, �Arrah, Pat! where�s the sheep now?�
Says I, �I dunno! barring one here at home,�
And the master began and kicked up a big row too,
And swore he�d stop the wages of Paddy Malone.
Arrah! Paddy Malone, you�re no shepherd, Ohone!
We�ll try you with bullocks now, Paddy Malone.

To see me dressed out with my team and my dray too,
Wid a whip like a flail and such gaiters, Ohone!
But the bullocks, as they eyed me, they seemed for to say too,
�You may do your best, Paddy, we�re blest if we go.�
�Gee whoa! Redman! come hither, Damper!
Hoot, Magpie! Gee, Blackbird! Come hither,
Whalebone!�

But the brutes turned round sharp, and away they did scamper,
And heels over head turned poor Paddy Malone.
Oh, Paddy Malone! you�ve seen some bulls at home,
But the bulls of Australia cows Paddy Malone.

I was found the next day where the brutes they did throw me
By a man passing by, upon hearing me groan,
And wiping the mud from my face that he knew me,
Says he, �Your name�s Paddy?� �Yes! Paddy Malone.�
I thin says to him, �You�re an angel sent down, sure!�
�No, faith, but I�m not; but a friend of your own!�
And by his persuasion, for home then I started,
And you now see before you poor Paddy Malone.
Arrah, Paddy Malone! you are now safe at home.
Bad luck to the agent that coaxed ye to roam.
