title: On A Crushed Hat
---

Brown was my friend, and faithful--but so fat!
 He came to see me in the twilight dim;
 I rose politely and invited him
To take a seat--how heavily he sat!

He sat upon the sofa, where my hat,
 My wanton Zephyr, rested on its rim;
 Its build, unlike my friend's, was rather slim,
And when he rose, I saw it, crushed and flat.

O Hat, that wast the apple of my eye,
 Thy brim is bent, six cracks are in thy crown,
And I shall never wear thee any more;
Upon a shelf thy loved remains shall lie,
 And with the years the dust will settle down
On thee, the neatest hat I ever wore!
