title: Written Upon Receiving A New Year's Gift.
---

I have a little Grandchild dear,
Who sends to me on each new year
A valuable present:
Not costly gift from store-house bought,
But one that her own hands have wrought,
Therefore to me more pleasant.

Accept, dear child, the wish sincere,
For you much happiness this year,
And length of days be given;
Here may you act well your part,
Serving the Lord with all your heart,
And find your rest in heaven.

Jan. 1852.
