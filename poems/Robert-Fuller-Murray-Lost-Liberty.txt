---

Of our own will we are not free,
 When freedom lies within our power.
 We wait for some decisive hour,
To rise and take our liberty.

Still we delay, content to be
 Imprisoned in our own high tower.
 What is it but a strong-built bower?
Ours are the warders, ours the key.

But we through indolence grow weak.
 Our warders, fed with power so long,
Become at last our lords indeed.
We vainly threaten, vainly seek
 To move their ruth.The bars are strong.
We dash against them till we bleed.
