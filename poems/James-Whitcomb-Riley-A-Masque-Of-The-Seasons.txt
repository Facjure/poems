title: A Masque Of The Seasons
---

Scene. - A kitchen. - Group of Children, popping corn. - The Fairy Queen of the Seasons discovered in the smoke of the corn-popper. - Waving her wand, and, with eerie, sharp, imperious ejaculations, addressing the bespelled auditors, who neither see nor hear her nor suspect her presence.


QUEEN

 Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall, - 
 Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE JASPER

 When I'm dressed warm as warm can be,
And with boots, to go
Through the deepest snow,
 Winter-time is the time for me!


QUEEN

 Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall, - 
 Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE MILDRED

 I like blossoms, and birds that sing;
 The grass and the dew,
 And the sunshine, too, - 
 So, best of all I like the Spring.


QUEEN

 Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall, - 
 Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE MANDEVILLE

 O little friends, I most rejoice
 When I hear the drums
 As the Circus comes, - 
 So Summer-time's my special choice.


QUEEN

 Summer or Winter or Spring or Fall, - 
 Which do you like the best of all?


LITTLE EDITH

 Apples of ruby, and pears of gold,
 And grapes of blue
 That the bee stings through. - 
 Fall - it is all that my heart can hold!


QUEEN

 Soh! my lovelings and pretty dears,
 You've each a favorite, it appears, - 
 Summer and Winter and Spring and Fall. - 
 That's the reason I send them all!
