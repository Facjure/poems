 Sometimes I keep
 From going to sleep,
 To hear the katydids "cheep-cheep!"
 And think they say
 Their prayers that way;
 But katydids don't have to pray!

 I listen when
 They cheep again
 And so, I think, they're singing then!
 But, no; I'm wrong, - 
 The sound's too long
 And all-alike to be a song!

 I think, "Well, there!
 I do declare,
 If it is neither song nor prayer,
 It's talk - and quite
 Too vain and light
 For me to listen to all night!"

 And so, I smile,
 And think, - "Now I'll
 Not listen for a little while!" - 
 Then, sweet and clear,
 Next "cheep" I hear
 'S a kiss.... Good morning, Mommy dear!
