 Section One

 "Give the engines room,
 Give the engines room."
 Louder, faster
 The little band-master
 Whips up the fluting,
 Hurries up the tooting.
 He thinks that he stands,
 # To be read, or chanted, with the heavy buzzing bass
of fire-engines pumping. #
 The reins in his hands,
 In the fire-chief's place
 In the night alarm chase.
 The cymbals whang,
 The kettledrums bang: - 
 # In this passage the reading or chanting
is shriller and higher. #
 "Clear the street,
 Clear the street,
 Clear the street - Boom, boom.
 In the evening gloom,
 In the evening gloom,
 Give the engines room,
 Give the engines room,
 Lest souls be trapped
 In a terrible tomb."
 The sparks and the pine-brands
 Whirl on high
 From the black and reeking alleys
 To the wide red sky.
 Hear the hot glass crashing,
 Hear the stone steps hissing.
 Coal black streams
 Down the gutters pour.
 There are cries for help
 From a far fifth floor.
 For a longer ladder
 Hear the fire-chief call.
 Listen to the music
 Of the firemen's ball.
 Listen to the music
 Of the firemen's ball.
 # To be read or chanted in a heavy bass. #
 "'Tis the
 NIGHT
 Of doom,"
 Say the ding-dong doom-bells.
 "NIGHT
 Of doom,"
 Say the ding-dong doom-bells.
 Faster, faster
 The red flames come.
 "Hum grum," say the engines,
 "Hum grum grum."
 # Shriller and higher. #
 "Buzz, buzz,"
 Says the crowd.
 "See, see,"
 Calls the crowd.
 "Look out,"
 Yelps the crowd
 And the high walls fall: - 
 Listen to the music
 Of the firemen's ball.
 Listen to the music
 Of the firemen's ball.
 # Heavy bass. #
 "'Tis the
 NIGHT
 Of doom,"
 Say the ding-dong doom-bells.
 "NIGHT
 Of doom,"
 Say the ding-dong doom-bells.
 Whangaranga, whangaranga,
 Whang, whang, whang,
 Clang, clang, clangaranga,
 # Bass, much slower. #
 Clang, clang, clang.
 Clang - a - ranga - 
 Clang - a - ranga - 
 Clang,
 Clang,
 Clang.
 Listen - to - the - music - 
 Of the firemen's ball - 


 Section Two

 "Many's the heart that's breaking
 If we could read them all
 After the ball is over."(An old song.)


 # To be read or sung slowly and softly,
in the manner of lustful, insinuating music. #
 Scornfully, gaily
 The bandmaster sways,
 Changing the strain
 That the wild band plays.
 With a red and royal intoxication,
 A tangle of sounds
 And a syncopation,
 Sweeping and bending
 From side to side,
 Master of dreams,
 With a peacock pride.
 A lord of the delicate flowers of delight
 He drives compunction
 Back through the night.
 Dreams he's a soldier
 Plumed and spurred,
 And valiant lads
 Arise at his word,
 Flaying the sober
 Thoughts he hates,
 Driving them back
 From the dream-town gates.
 How can the languorous
 Dancers know
 The red dreams come
 # To be read or chanted slowly and softly
in the manner of lustful insinuating music. #
 When the good dreams go?
 "'Tis the
 NIGHT
 Of love,"
 Call the silver joy-bells,
 "NIGHT
 Of love,"
 Call the silver joy-bells.
 "Honey and wine,
 Honey and wine.
 Sing low, now, violins,
 Sing, sing low,
 Blow gently, wood-wind,
 Mellow and slow.
 Like midnight poppies
 The sweethearts bloom.
 Their eyes flash power,
 Their lips are dumb.
 Faster and faster
 Their pulses come,
 Though softer now
 The drum-beats fall.
 Honey and wine,
 Honey and wine.
 'Tis the firemen's ball,
 'Tis the firemen's ball.

 # With a climax of whispered mourning. #
 "I am slain,"
 Cries true-love
 There in the shadow.
 "And I die,"
 Cries true-love,
 There laid low.
 "When the fire-dreams come,
 The wise dreams go."
 # Suddenly interrupting.To be read or sung in
a heavy bass.First eight lines as harsh as possible.
Then gradually musical and sonorous. #
 BUT HIS CRY IS DROWNED
 BY THE PROUD BAND-MASTER.
 And now great gongs whang,
 Sharper, faster,
 And kettledrums rattle
 And hide the shame
 With a swish and a swirk
 In dead love's name.
 Red and crimson
 And scarlet and rose
 Magical poppies
 The sweethearts bloom.
 The scarlet stays
 When the rose-flush goes,
 And love lies low
 In a marble tomb.
 "'Tis the
 NIGHT
 Of doom,"
 Call the ding-dong doom-bells.
 "NIGHT
 Of Doom,"
 Call the ding-dong doom-bells.
 # Sharply interrupting in a very high key. #
Hark how the piccolos still make cheer.
"'Tis a moonlight night in the spring of the year."
 # Heavy bass. #

 Section Three

In Which, contrary to Artistic Custom, the moral of the piece is placed before the reader.

(From the first Khandaka of the Mahavagga:"There Buddha thus addressed his disciples:'Everything, O mendicants, is burning. With what fire is it burning?I declare unto you it is burning with the fire of passion, with the fire of anger, with the fire of ignorance. It is burning with the anxieties of birth, decay and death, grief, lamentation, suffering and despair....A disciple,... becoming weary of all that, divests himself of passion. By absence of passion, he is made free.'")


 # To be intoned after the manner of a priestly service. #
 I once knew a teacher,
 Who turned from desire,
 Who said to the young men
 "Wine is a fire."
 Who said to the merchants: - 
 "Gold is a flame
 That sears and tortures
 If you play at the game."
 I once knew a teacher
 Who turned from desire
 Who said to the soldiers,
 "Hate is a fire."
 Who said to the statesmen: - 
 "Power is a flame
 That flays and blisters
 If you play at the game."
 I once knew a teacher
 Who turned from desire,
 Who said to the lordly,

 "Pride is a fire."
 Who thus warned the revellers: - 
 "Life is a flame.
 Be cold as the dew
 Would you win at the game
 With hearts like the stars,
 With hearts like the stars."
 # Interrupting very loudly for the last time. #
 SO BEWARE,
 SO BEWARE,
 SO BEWARE OF THE FIRE.
 Clear the streets,
 BOOM, BOOM,
 Clear the streets,
 BOOM, BOOM,
 GIVE THE ENGINES ROOM,
 GIVE THE ENGINES ROOM,
 LEST SOULS BE TRAPPED
 IN A TERRIBLE TOMB.
 SAYS THE SWIFT WHITE HORSE
 TO THE SWIFT BLACK HORSE: - 
 "THERE GOES THE ALARM,
 THERE GOES THE ALARM.
 THEY ARE HITCHED, THEY ARE OFF,
 THEY ARE GONE IN A FLASH,
 AND THEY STRAIN AT THE DRIVER'S IRON ARM."
