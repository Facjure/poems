 'Lady Jane, O Lady Jane!
 Your hound hath broken bounds again,
And chased my timorous deer, O;
 If him I see,
 That hour he'll dee;
My brakes shall be his bier, O.'

 'Lord A�rie, Lord A�rie,
 My hound, I trow, is fleet and free,
He's welcome to your deer, O;
 Shoot, shoot you may,
 He'll gang his way,
Your threats we nothing fear, O.'

 He's fetched him in, he's fetched him in,
 Gone all his swiftness, all his din,
White fang, and glowering eye, O:
 'Here is your beast,
 And now at least
My herds in peace shall lie, O.'

 "In peace!" my lord, O mark me well!
 For what my jolly hound befell
You shall sup twenty-fold, O!
 For every tooth
 Of his, i'sooth,
A stag in pawn I hold, O.

 'Huntsman and horn, huntsman and horn,
 Shall scare your heaths and coverts lorn,
Braying 'em shrill and clear, O;
 But lone and still
 Shall lift each hill,
Each valley wan and sere, O.

 'Ride up you may, ride down you may,
 Lonely or trooped, by night or day,
My hound shall haunt you ever:
 Bird, beast, and game
 Shall dread the same,
The wild fish of your river.'

 Her cheek is like the angry rose,
 Her eye with wrath and pity flows:
He gazes fierce and round, O, - 
 'Dear Lord!' he says,
 'What loveliness
To waste upon a hound, O.

 'I'd give my stags, my hills and dales,
 My stormcocks and my nightingales
To have undone this deed, O;
 For deep beneath
 My heart is death
Which for her love doth bleed, O.'

 Wanders he up, wanders he down,
 On foot, a-horse, by night and noon:
His lands are bleak and drear, O;
 Forsook his dales
 Of nightingales,
Forsook his moors of deer, O.

 Forsook his heart, ah me! of mirth;
 There's nothing lightsome left on earth:
Only one scene is fain, O,
 Where far remote
 The moonbeams gloat,
And sleeps the lovely Jane, O.

 Until an eve when lone he went,
 Gnawing his beard in dreariment,
Lo! from a thicket hidden,
 Lovely as flower
 In April hour,
Steps forth a form unbidden.

 'Get ye now down, Lord A�rie,
 I'm troubled so I'm like to dee,'
She cries, 'twixt joy and grief, O;
 'The hound is dead,
 When all is said,
But love is past belief, O.

 'Nights, nights I've lain your lands to see,
 Forlorn and still - and all for me,
All for a foolish curse, O;
 Now here am I
 Come out to die,
To live unlov'd is worse, O!'

 In faith, this lord, in that lone dale,
 Hears now a sweeter nightingale,
And lairs a tend'rer deer, O;
 His sorrow goes
 Like mountain snows
In waters sweet and clear, O!

 Let the hound bay in Shadowland,
 Tuning his ear to understand
What voice hath tamed this A�rie;
 Chafe, chafe he may
 The stag all day,
And never thirst nor weary.

 Now here he smells, now there he smells,
 Winding his voice along the dells,
Till grey flows up the morn, O;
 Then hies again
 To Lady Jane,
No longer now forlorn, O.

 Ay, as it were a bud, did break
 To loveliness for A�rie's sake,
So she in beauty moving
 Rides at his hand
 Across his land,
Beloved as well as loving.
