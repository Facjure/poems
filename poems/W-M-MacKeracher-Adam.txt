God made him, like the angels, innocent,
 And made a garden marvellously fair,
With arbors green, sun-kissed and dew-besprent,
 And fruits and flowers whose fragrance filled the air;
Where rivers four meandered with delight,
 And in the soil were gleaming treasures laid,
Good gold and bdellium and the onyx bright;
 And set therein the man whom He had made;

And proved to him by sad experience
 That not in bowers of indolence, supine
On beds of ease, could ev'n Omnipotence
 Work out in man His last and best design;
And in great love and wisdom drove him thence,
 And cursed him with a blessing most benign.
