 There is a haunting phantom called Regret,
 A shadowy creature robed somewhat like Woe,
 But fairer in the face, whom all men know
 By her sad mien and eyes forever wet.
 No heart would seek her; but once having met,
 All take her by the hand, and to and fro
 They wander through those paths of long ago - 
 Those hallowed ways 'twere wiser to forget.

 One day she led me to that lost land's gate
 And bade me enter; but I answered "No!
 I will pass on with my bold comrade, Fate;
 I have no tears to waste on thee - no time;
 My strength I hoard for heights I hope to climb:
 No friend art thou for souls that would be great."
