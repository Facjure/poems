1.
What are little boys made of?
What are little boys made of?
Frogs and snails and puppy-dog's tails,
And that are little boys made of.

2.
What are little girls made of?
What are little girls made of?
Sugar and spice and all that's nice,
And that are little girls made of.

3.
What are young men made of?
What are young men made of?
Sighs and leers, and crocodile tears,
And that are young men made of.

4.
What are young women made of?
What are young women made of?
Ribbons and laces, and sweet pretty faces,
And that are young women made of.
