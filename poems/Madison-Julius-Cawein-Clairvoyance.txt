 The sunlight that makes of the heaven
 A pathway for sylphids to throng;
 The wind that makes harps of the forests
 For spirits to smite into song,
 Are the image and voice of a vision
 That comforts my heart and makes strong.

 I look in one's face, and the shadows
 Are lifted: and, lo, I can see,
 Through windows of evident being,
 That open on eternity,
 The form of the essence of Beauty
 God clothes with His own mystery.

 I lean to one's voice, and the wrangle
 Of living hath pause: and I hear
 Through doors of invisible spirit,
 That open on light that is clear,
 The radiant raiment of Music
 In the hush of the heavens sweep near.
