Honour and happiness unite
To make the Christian�s name a praise;
How fair the scene, how clear the light,
That fills the remnant of his days!


A kingly character he bears,
No change his priestly office knows;
Unfading is the crown he wears,
His joys can never reach a close.


Adorn�d with glory from on high,
Salvation shines upon his face;
His robe is of the ethereal dye,
His steps are dignity and grace.


Inferior honours he disdains,
Nor stoops to take applause from earth:
The King of kings himself maintains
The expenses of his heavenly birth.


The noblest creature seen below,
Ordain�d to fill a throne above;
God gives him all he can bestow,
His kingdom of eternal love.


My soul is ravish�d at the thought!
Methinks from earth I see him rise!
Angels congratulate his lot,
And shout him welcome to the skies!
