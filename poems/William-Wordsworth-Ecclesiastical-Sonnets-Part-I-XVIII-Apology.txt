 Nor scorn the aid which Fancy oft doth lend
 The Soul's eternal interests to promote:
 Death, darkness, danger, are our natural lot;
 And evil Spirits 'may' our walk attend
 For aught the wisest know or comprehend;
 Then be 'good' Spirits free to breathe a note
 Of elevation; let their odours float
 Around these Converts; and their glories blend,
 The midnight stars outshining, or the blaze
 Of the noon-day. Nor doubt that golden cords
 Of good works, mingling with the visions, raise
 The Soul to purer worlds: and 'who' the line
 Shall draw, the limits of the power define,
 That even imperfect faith to man affords?
