A MEMORY OF WILLIAM BARNES



 Silently I footed by an uphill road
 That led from my abode to a spot yew-boughed;
Yellowly the sun sloped low down to westward,
 And dark was the east with cloud.

 Then, amid the shadow of that livid sad east,
 Where the light was least, and a gate stood wide,
Something flashed the fire of the sun that was facing it,
 Like a brief blaze on that side.

 Looking hard and harder I knew what it meant -
 The sudden shine sent from the livid east scene;
It meant the west mirrored by the coffin of my friend there,
 Turning to the road from his green,

 To take his last journey forth - he who in his prime
 Trudged so many a time from that gate athwart the land!
Thus a farewell to me he signalled on his grave-way,
 As with a wave of his hand.

WINTERBORNE-CAME PATH.
