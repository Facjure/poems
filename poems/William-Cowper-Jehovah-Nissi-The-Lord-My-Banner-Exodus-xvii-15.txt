By whom was David taught
To aim the deadly blow,
When he Goliath fought,
And laid the Gittite low?
Nor sword nor spear the stripling took,
But chose a pebble from the brook.


�Twas Israel�s God and King
Who sent him to the fight;
Who gave him strength to sling,
And skill to aim aright.
Ye feeble saints, your strength endures,
Because young David�s God is yours.


Who order�d Gideon forth,
To storm the invader�s camp,
With arms of little worth,
A pitcher and a lamp?[1]
The trumpets made his coming known,
And all the host was overthrown.


Oh! I have seen the day,
When, with a single word,
God helping me to say,
My trust is in the Lord,
My soul hath quell�d a thousand foes,
Fearless of all that could oppose.


But unbelief, self-will,
Self-righteousness, and pride,
How often do they steal
My weapon from my side!
Yet David�s Lord, and Gideon�s friend,
Will help his servant to the end.
