title: The Good-Night Or Blessing
---

Blessings in abundance come
To the bride and to her groom;
May the bed and this short night
Know the fullness of delight!
Pleasure many here attend ye,
And, ere long, a boy love send ye,
Curled and comely, and so trim,
Maids in time may ravish him.
Thus a dew of graces fall
On ye both; good-night to all.
