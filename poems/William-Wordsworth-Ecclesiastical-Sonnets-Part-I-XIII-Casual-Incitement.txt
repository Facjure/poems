title: Ecclesiastical Sonnets - Part I. - XIII - Casual Incitement
---

 A bright-haired company of youthful slaves,
 Beautiful strangers, stand within the pale
 Of a sad market, ranged for public sale,
 Where Tiber's stream the immortal City laves:
 Angli by name; and not an Angel waves
 His wing who could seem lovelier to man's eye
 Than they appear to holy Gregory;
 Who, having learnt that name, salvation craves
 For Them, and for their Land. The earnest Sire,
 His questions urging, feels, in slender ties
 Of chiming sound, commanding sympathies;
 De-Irians, he would save them from God's ire;
 Subjects of Saxon Aella, they shall sing
 Glad Halle-lujahs to the eternal King!
