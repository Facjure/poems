title: The Change
---

 Out of the past there rises a week -
 Who shall read the years O! -
 Out of the past there rises a week
 Enringed with a purple zone.
 Out of the past there rises a week
 When thoughts were strung too thick to speak,
And the magic of its lineaments remains with me alone.

 In that week there was heard a singing -
 Who shall spell the years, the years! -
 In that week there was heard a singing,
 And the white owl wondered why.
 In that week, yea, a voice was ringing,
 And forth from the casement were candles flinging
Radiance that fell on the deodar and lit up the path thereby.

 Could that song have a mocking note? -
 Who shall unroll the years O! -
 Could that song have a mocking note
 To the white owl's sense as it fell?
 Could that song have a mocking note
 As it trilled out warm from the singer's throat,
And who was the mocker and who the mocked when two felt all was well?

 In a tedious trampling crowd yet later -
 Who shall bare the years, the years! -
 In a tedious trampling crowd yet later,
 When silvery singings were dumb;
 In a crowd uncaring what time might fate her,
 Mid murks of night I stood to await her,
And the twanging of iron wheels gave out the signal that she was come.

 She said with a travel-tired smile -
 Who shall lift the years O! -
 She said with a travel-tired smile,
 Half scared by scene so strange;
 She said, outworn by mile on mile,
 The blurred lamps wanning her face the while,
"O Love, I am here; I am with you!" . . . Ah, that there should have come a change!

 O the doom by someone spoken -
 Who shall unseal the years, the years! -
 O the doom that gave no token,
 When nothing of bale saw we:
 O the doom by someone spoken,
 O the heart by someone broken,
The heart whose sweet reverberances are all time leaves to me.

Jan.-Feb. 1913.
