 All last night I had quiet
In a fragrant dream and warm: 
 She became my Sabbath,
And round my neck, her arm.

 I knew the warmth in my dreaming;
The fragrance, I suppose, 
 Was her hair about me,
Or else she wore a rose.

 Her hair I think; for likest
Woodruffe 'twas, when Spring 
 Loitering down the wet woodways
Treads it sauntering.

 No light, nor any speaking;
Fragrant only and warm. 
 Enough to know my lodging,
The white Sabbath of her arm.
