As I was walking
Alone by the sea,
"What is that whisper?"
Said Merlin to me.
"Only," I answered,
"The sigh of the wave"--
"Oh, no," replied Merlin,
"'Tis the grass on your grave."

As I lay dreaming
In churchyard ground
"Listen," said Merlin,
"What is that sound?"
"The green grass is growing,"
I answered; but he
Chuckled, "Oh, no!
'Tis the sound of the sea."

As I went homeward
At dusk by the shore,
"What is that crimson?"
Said Merlin once more.
"Only the sun," I said.
"Sinking to rest"--
"Sunset for East," he said,
"Sunrise for West."
