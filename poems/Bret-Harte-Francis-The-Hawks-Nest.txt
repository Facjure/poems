We checked our pace, the red road sharply rounding;
We heard the troubled flow
Of the dark olive depths of pines resounding
A thousand feet below.

Above the tumult of the canyon lifted,
The gray hawk breathless hung,
Or on the hill a winged shadow drifted
Where furze and thorn-bush clung;

Or where half-way the mountain side was furrowed
With many a seam and scar;
Or some abandoned tunnel dimly burrowed,
A mole-hill seen so far.

We looked in silence down across the distant
Unfathomable reach:
A silence broken by the guide�s consistent
And realistic speech.

�Walker of Murphy�s blew a hole through Peters
For telling him he lied;
Then up and dusted out of South Hornitos
Across the Long Divide.

�We ran him out of Strong�s, and up through Eden,
And �cross the ford below,
And up this canyon (Peters� brother leadin�),
And me and Clark and Joe.

�He fou�t us game: somehow I disremember
Jest how the thing kem round;
Some say �twas wadding, some a scattered ember
From fires on the ground.

�But in one minute all the hill below him
Was just one sheet of flame;
Guardin� the crest, Sam Clark and I called to him,
And, well, the dog was game!

�He made no sign: the fires of hell were round him,
The pit of hell below.
We sat and waited, but we never found him;
And then we turned to go.

�And then you see that rock that�s grown so bristly
With chapparal and tan
Suthin crep� out: it might hev been a grizzly
It might hev been a man;

�Suthin that howled, and gnashed its teeth, and shouted
In smoke and dust and flame;
Suthin that sprang into the depths about it,
Grizzly or man, but game!

�That�s all! Well, yes, it does look rather risky,
And kinder makes one queer
And dizzy looking down. A drop of whiskey
Ain�t a bad thing right here!�
