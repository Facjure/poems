Some starlit garden grey with dew,
Some chamber flushed with wine and fire,
What matters where, so I and you
 Are worthy our desire?

Behind, a past that scolds and jeers
For ungirt loin and lamp unlit;
In front the unmanageable years,
 The trap upon the pit;

Think on the shame of dreams for deeds,
The scandal of unnatural strife,
The slur upon immortal needs,
 The treason done to life:

Arise! no more a living lie
And with me quicken and control
A memory that shall magnify
 The universal Soul.
