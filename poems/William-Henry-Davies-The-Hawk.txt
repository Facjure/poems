---

Thou dost not fly, thou art not perched,
 The air is all around:
What is it that can keep thee set,
 From falling to the ground?
The concentration of thy mind
 Supports thee in the air;
As thou dost watch the small young birds,
 With such a deadly care.

My mind has such a hawk as thou,
 It is an evil mood;
It comes when there's no cause for grief,
 And on my joys doth brood.
Then do I see my life in parts;
 The earth receives my bones,
The common air absorbs my mind -
 It knows not flowers from stones.
