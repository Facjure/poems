Beyond M�gdalen and by the Bridge, on a place called there the Plain,
In Summer, in a burst of summertime
Following falls and falls of rain,
When the air was sweet-and-sour of the flown fineflower of
Those goldnails and their gaylinks that hang along a lime;
. . . . . . . .

The motion of that man's heart is fine
Whom want could not make p�ne, p�ne
That struggling should not sear him, a gift should cheer him
Like that poor pocket of pence, poor pence of mine.
