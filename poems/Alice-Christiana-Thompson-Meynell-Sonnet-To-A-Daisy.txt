title: Sonnet--To A Daisy
---

Slight as thou art, thou art enough to hide,
 Like all created things, secrets from me,
 And stand a barrier to eternity.
And I, how can I praise thee well and wide?

From where I dwell--upon the hither side?
 Thou little veil for so great mystery,
 When shall I penetrate all things and thee,
And then look back?For this I must abide,

Till thou shalt grow and fold and be unfurled
 Literally between me and the world.
Then I shall drink from in beneath a spring,

And from a poet's side shall read his book.
 O daisy mine, what will it be to look
From God's side even of such a simple thing?
