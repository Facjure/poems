I

When one is young and eager,
 A bejant and a boy,
Though his moustache be meagre,
 That cannot mar his joy
When at the Competition
He takes a fair position,
And feels he has a mission,
 A talent to employ.

With pride he goes each morning
 Clad in a scarlet gown,
A cap his head adorning
 (Both bought of Mr. Brown);
 He hears the harsh bell jangle,
And enters the quadrangle,
The classic tongues to mangle
 And make the ancients frown.

He goes not forth at even,
 He burns the midnight oil,
He feels that all his heaven
 Depends on ceaseless toil;
Across his exercises
A dream of many prizes
Before his spirit rises,
 And makes his raw blood boil.

II

Though he be green as grass is,
 And fresh as new-mown hay
Before the first year passes
 His verdure fades away.
 His hopes now faintly glimmer,
Grow dim and ever dimmer,
And with a parting shimmer
 Melt into 'common day.'

He cares no more for Liddell
 Or Scott; and Smith, and White,
And Lewis, Short, and Riddle
 Are 'emptied of delight.'
Todhunter and Colenso
(Alas, that friendships end so!)
He curses in extenso
 Through morning, noon, and night.

No more with patient labour
 The midnight oil he burns,
But unto some near neighbour
 His fair young face he turns,
 To share the harmless tattle
Which bejants love to prattle,
As wise as infant's rattle
 Or talk of coots and herns.

At midnight round the city
 He carols wild and free
Some sweet unmeaning ditty
 In many a changing key;
And each succeeding verse is
Commingled with the curses
Of those whose sleep disperses
 Like sal volatile.

He shaves and takes his toddy
 Like any fourth year man,
And clothes his growing body
 After another plan
 Than that which once delighted
When, in the days benighted,
Like some wild thing excited
 About the fields he ran.

III

A sweet life and an idle
 He lives from year to year,
Unknowing bit or bridle
 (There are no proctors here),
Free as the flying swallow
Which Ida's Prince would follow
If but his bones were hollow,
 Until the end draws near.

Then comes a Dies Irae,
 When full of misery
And torments worse than fiery
 He crams for his degree;
 And hitherto unvexed books,
Dry lectures, abstracts, text-books,
Perplexing and perplexed books,
 Make life seem vanity.

IV

Before admiring sister
 And mother, see, he stands,
Made Artium Magister
 With laying on of hands.
He gives his books to others
(Perchance his younger brothers),
And free from all such bothers
 Goes out into all lands.
