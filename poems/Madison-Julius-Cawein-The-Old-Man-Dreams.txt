The blackened walnut in its spicy hull
 Rots where it fell;
And, in the orchard, where the trees stand full,
 The pear's ripe bell
Drops; and the log-house in the bramble lane,
 From whose low door
Stretch yellowing acres of the corn and cane,
 He sees once more.

The cat-bird sings upon its porch of pine;
 And o'er its gate,
All slender-podded, twists the trumpet-vine,
 A leafy weight;
And in the woodland, by the spring, mayhap,
 With eyes of joy
Again he bends to set a rabbit-trap,
 A brown-faced boy.

Then, whistling, through the underbrush he goes,
 Out of the wood,
Where, with young cheeks, red as an Autumn rose,
 Beneath her hood,
His sweetheart waits, her school-books on her arm;
 And now it seems
Beside his chair he sees his wife's fair form - 
 The old man dreams.
