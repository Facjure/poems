Grown tired of mourning for my sins, 
And brooding over merits, 
The other night with bothered brow
I went amongst the spirits;
And I met one that I knew well:
�Oh, Scotty�s Ghost, is that you?
�And did you see the fearsome crowd
�At Robbie Burns�s statue?
�They hurried up in hansom cabs,
�Tall-hatted and frock-coated;
�They trained it in from all the towns,
�The weird and hairy-throated;
�They spoke in some outlandish tongue,
�They cut some comic capers,
�And ilka man was wild to get
�His name in all the papers.

�They showed no gleam of intellect,
�Those frauds who rushed before us;
�They knew one verse of �Auld Lang Syne, �
�The first one and the chorus:
�They clacked the clack o� Scotlan�s Bard,
�They glibly talked of �Rabby;�
�But what if he had come to them
�Without a groat and shabby?

�They drank and wept for Robbie�s sake,
�They stood and brayed like asses
�(The living bard�s a drunken rake,
�The dead one loved the lasses);
�If Robbie Burns were here, they�d sit
�As still as any mouse is;
�If Robbie Burns should come their way,
�They�d turn him out their houses.

�Oh, weep for bonny Scotland�s bard!
�And praise the Scottish nation,
�Who made him spy and let him die
�Heart-broken in privation:
�Exciseman, so that he might live
�Through northern winters� rigours, 
�Just as in southern lands they give
�The hard-up rhymer figures.

�We need some songs of stinging fun
�To wake the States and light �em;
�I wish a man like Robert Burns
�Were here to-day to write �em!
�But still the mockery shall survive
�Till the Day o� Judgment crashes, 
�The men we scorn when we�re alive
�With praise insult our ashes.�

And Scotty�s ghost said: �Never mind
�The fleas that you inherit;
�The living bard can flick them off, 
�They cannot hurt his spirit.
�The crawlers round the bardie�s name
�Shall crawl through all the ages;
�His work�s the living thing, and they
�Are fly-dirt on the pages.�
