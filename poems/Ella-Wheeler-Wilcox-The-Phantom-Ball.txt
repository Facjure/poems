You remember the hall on the corner?
 To-night as I walked down street
I heard the sound of music,
 And the rhythmic beat and beat,
In time to the pulsing measure
 Of lightly tripping feet.

And I turned and entered the doorway - 
 It was years since I had been there - 
Years, and life seemed altered:
 Pleasure had changed to care.
But again I was hearing the music
 And watching the dancers fair.

And then, as I stood and listened,
 The music lost its glee;
And instead of the merry waltzers
 There were ghosts of the Used-to-be - 
Ghosts of the pleasure-seekers
 Who once had danced with me.

Oh, 'twas a ghastly picture!
 Oh, 'twas a gruesome crowd!
Each bearing a skull on his shoulder,
 Each trailing a long white shroud,
As they whirled in the dance together,
 And the music shrieked aloud.

As they danced, their dry bones rattled
 Like shutters in a blast;
And they stared from eyeless sockets
 On me as they circled past;
And the music that kept them whirling
 Was a funeral dirge played fast.

Some of them wore their face-cloths,
 Others were rotted away.
Some had mould on their garments,
 And some seemed dead but a day.
Corpses all, but I knew them
 As friends, once blithe and gay.

Beauty and strength and manhood - 
 And this was the end of it all:
Nothing but phantoms whirling
 In a ghastly skeleton ball.
But the music ceased - and they vanished,
 And I came away from the hall.
