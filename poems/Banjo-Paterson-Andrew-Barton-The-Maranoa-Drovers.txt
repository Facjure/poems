 (Air: �Little Sally Waters.�)


The night is dark and stormy, and the sky is clouded o�er;
Our horses we will mount and ride away,
To watch the squatters� cattle through the darkness of the night,
And we�ll keep them on the camp till break of day.

Chorus

 For we�re going, going, going to Gunnedah so far,
 And we�ll soon be into sunny New South Wales;
 We shall bid farewell to Queensland, with its swampy coolibah�
 Happy drovers from the sandy Maranoa.


When the fires are burning bright through the darkness of the night,
And the cattle camping quiet, well, I�m sure
That I wish for two o�clock when I call the other watch�
This is droving from the sandy Maranoa.

Our beds made on the ground, we are sleeping all so sound
When we�re wakened by the distant thunder�s roar,
And the lightning�s vivid flash, followed by an awful crash-
It�s rough on drovers from the sandy Maranoa.

We are up at break of day, and we�re all soon on the way,
For we always have to go ten miles or more;
It don�t do to loaf about, or the squatter will come out�
He�s strict on drovers from the sandy Maranoa.

We shall soon be on the Moonie, and we�ll cross the Barwon, too;
Then we�ll be out upon the rolling plains once more;
We�ll shout �Hurrah! for old Queensland, with its swampy coolibah,
And the cattle that come off the Maranoa.�
