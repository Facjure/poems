[12]


 Aloft he guards the starry folds
 Who is the brother of the star;
 The bird whose joy is in the wind
 Exultleth in the war.

 No painted plume - a sober hue,
 His beauty is his power;
 That eager calm of gaze intent
 Foresees the Sibyl's hour.

 Austere, he crowns the swaying perch,
 Flapped by the angry flag;
 The hurricane from the battery sings,
 But his claw has known the crag.

 Amid the scream of shells, his scream
 Runs shrilling; and the glare
 Of eyes that brave the blinding sun
 The vollied flame can bear.

 The pride of quenchless strength is his - 
 Strength which, though chained, avails;
 The very rebel looks and thrills - 
 The anchored Emblem hails.

 Though scarred in many a furious fray,
 No deadly hurt he knew;
 Well may we think his years are charmed - 
 The Eagle of the Blue.
 
 12. Among the Northwestern regiments there would seem to have been more than one which carried a living eagle as an added ensign. The bird commemorated here was, according the the account, borne aloft on a perch beside the standard; went through successive battles and campaigns; was more than once under the surgeon's hands; and at the close of the contest found honorable repose in the capital of Wisconsin, from which state he had gone to the wars.
