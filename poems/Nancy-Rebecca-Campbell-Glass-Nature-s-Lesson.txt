title: Nature's Lesson
---

We traveled by a mountain's edge,
It was September calm and bright,
Nature had decked its rocky ledge
With flowers of varied hue and height.
It seemed a miracle that they
Should flourish in that meager soil,
As noble spirits oftenest may
Gleam forth through poverty and toil.

Below were rippling, sparkling streams
Through meadows kissed by shadowy hills,
Reflecting autumn's peaceful dreams
Within those swift, translucent rills.
This lesson should these scenes impart
As on the road of life we go,
To do our duty and take heart,
As flowers bloom and streamlets flow.

Perhaps in ages yet to be
May flowers wave here e'en as today,
These streams still rush in merry glee
To cheer and charm who here may stray;
But we upon Time's rapid tide
Like morning mists will disappear;
But if by faith to Christ allied,
Heaven's glory is both sure and clear.

We look from Nature to her God;
We feel his presence from above;
We know that when the earth he trod,
He preached through her his wondrous love.
What is there in our flitting years
With this pure treasure can compare?
His love can wipe away our tears,
His love can lighten every care.
