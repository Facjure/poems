title: O Radiance Of Life's Morning.

O Radiance of life's morning! O gold without alloy!
O love that lives through all the years! O full, O perfect joy!

The hills of earth touch heaven, the heaven of blue and gold,
And angel voices swell the song of love and peace untold!

O radiance of life's morning!
 The dew within the rose,
The fragrance fresh from Eden
 That freights each breeze that blows!

Dear Christ, the wine of Cana pour out in rich supply,
These hearts keep young with gladness while all the years go by!

O radiance of life's morning!
 O gold without alloy!
O love that lives through all the years,
 O full, O perfect joy!
