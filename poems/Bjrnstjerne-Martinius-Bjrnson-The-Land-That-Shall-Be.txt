(DEDICATED TO HERMAN ANKER AND M. ANKER ON THE OCCASION OF THEIR SILVER-WEDDING, SEPTEMBER 15, 1888)
(See Note 75)

 Land that shall be
Thither, when thwarted our longings, we sail, - 
Sighs to the clouds, that we breathe when we fail,
Form a mirage of rich valley and mead
 Over our need, - 
Visions revealing the future until
 Faith shall fulfil, - 
 The land that shall be.

 Land that shall be!
All of our labor to sow seeds of gain
Grows in the ages when our names shall wane,
Gathered with others', 't is stored in the true
 Will to renew.
This then shall carry our labor within,
 Safely within
 The land that shall be.

 Land that shall be!
Tears that are shed over evil's foul blight,
Blood-sweat in conflict to win higher right,
Hallow the will unto victory's cost.
 Let us be lost,
Rooting out wrong, that the good we may sow,
 Soon overgrow
 The land that shall be.

 Land that shall be!
Looming in beauty of colors and song,
Golden in sunlight that glad makes and strong,
Present in children's eyes, looking to-day
 Down when you pray.
Winning good victories gives us the power
 To own a brief hour
 The land that shall be.
