Oh lend me thy hand in the darkness,
Lead me once more to the light,
Bear with my folly and weakness,
Point me the way to do right.
Long have I groped in the shadow
Of error, temptation and doubt,
In the maze I've strayed hither and thither,
Vainly seeking to find a way out.

When I grasp thy firm hand in the darkness,
Courage takes place of my fear;
No more do I shudder and tremble,
When I know that my loved one is near.
From sorrow and trouble, oh, lead me; - 
From dangers that sorely affright,
Till at last every terror shall leave me,
And I rest in thine own loving light.

Rest! Aye, rest! If I have thy forgiveness,
If thy strong arm about me is twined;
Let the past, like a horrible vision,
Be for ever cast out of thy mind.
When I wilfully all my vows slighted,
And sought joy in a glittering sin,
I found but two lives that were blighted,
Two hearts filled with ruin within.

Oh, take me again to thy bosom,
With a kiss, tho' it be on my brow;
And forgive one who wayward and sinful,
Ne'er knew how she loved thee till now.
And keep me away from the darkness,
Let thy hand lead me on evermore,
Let me cling to thee, bless thee, and love thee,
As no loved one was e'er loved before.
