 Not ceaseless falls the heavy shower
That drenches deep the furrow'd lea;
 Nor do continual tempests pour
On the vex'd [2]Caspian's billowy sea;
 Nor yet the ice, in silent horror, stands
 Thro' all the passing months on pale [3]Armenia's Lands.

 Fierce storms do not for ever bend
The Mountain's vast and labouring oak,
 Nor from the ash its foliage rend,
With ruthless whirl, and widowing stroke;
 But, Valgius, thou, with grief's eternal lays
 Mournest thy vanish'd joys in MYSTES' shorten'd days.

 When [4]Vesper trembles in the west,
Or flies before the orient sun,
 Rise the lone sorrows of thy breast. - 
Not thus did aged Nestor shun
 Consoling strains, nor always sought the tomb,
 Where sunk his [5]filial Hopes, in life and glory's bloom.

 Not thus, the lovely Troilus slain,
His Parents wept the Princely Boy;
 Nor thus his Sisters mourn'd, in vain,
The blasted Flower of sinking Troy;
 Cease, then, thy fond complaints! - Augustus' fame,
 The new Cesarian wreaths, let thy lov'd voice proclaim!

 So shall the listening World be told
[6]Medus, and cold Niphates guide,
 With all their mighty Realms controul'd,
Their late proud waves in narrower tide;
 That in scant space their steeds the [7]Scythians rein,
 Nor dare transgress the bounds our Victor Arms ordain.
