Blow out the light: there is no oil to feed it:
 That dim blue light unworthy of the name.
Better to sit with folded hands, I say,
And wait for night to pass, and bring the day,
 Than to depend upon that flickering flame.

Take back your vow: there is no love to bind it:
 Take back this little shining, golden thing.
Better to walk on bravely all alone,
Than strive to hold up, or retain our own,
 By soulless pledge, or fetter of a ring.

When first the lamp was lit, too high you turned it;
 The oil was wasted in a blinding blaze.
Your passion was too ardent in the start -
Set by the lamp: farewell.God gird the heart
 Through darkened hours, and lone and loveless ways.
