 What a difference in the morning
When you try to raise your head;
 When your eyelids seem so heavy
You could swear they were of lead;
 When your tongue is thickly coated
And you have an awful thirst;
 When you drink so much cold water
That you feel about to burst;
 When you lift your hand towards heaven
And solemnly do say:
 "I'm going to 'cut out' drinking
And I'll swear off right to-day."
