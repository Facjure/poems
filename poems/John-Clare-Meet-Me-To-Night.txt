title: Meet Me To-Night
---

 O meet me to-night by the bright starlight,
 Now the pleasant Spring's begun.
 My own dear maid, by the greenwood shade,
 In the crimson set of the sun,
 Meet me to-night.

 The sun he goes down with a ruby crown
 To a gold and crimson bed;
 And the falling dew, from heaven so blue,
 Hangs pearls on Phoebe's head.
 Love, leave the town.

 Come thou with me; 'neath the green-leaf tree
 We'll crop the bonny sweet brere.
 O come, dear maid, 'neath the hazlewood shade,
 For love invites us there.
 Come then with me.

 The owl pops, scarce seen, from the ivy green,
 With his spectacles on I ween:
 See the moon's above and the stars twinkle, love;
 Better time was never seen.
 O come, my queen.

 The fox he stops, and down he drops
 His head beneath the grass.
 The birds are gone; we're all alone;
 O come, my bonny lass.
 Come, O come!
