I do not love my Empire�s foes,
Nor call �em angels; still,
What is the sense of �atin� those
�Oom you are paid to kill?
So, barrin� all that foreign lot
Which only joined for spite,
Myself, I�d just as soon as not
Respect the man I fight.
Ah there, Piet!, �is trousies to �is knees,
�Is coat-tails lyin� level in the bullet-sprinkled breeze;
�E does not lose �is rifle an� �e does not lose �is seat,
I�ve known a lot o� people ride a dam� sight worse than Piet.

I�ve �eard �im cryin� from the ground
Like Abel�s blood of old,
An� skirmished out to look, an� found
The beggar nearly cold.
I�ve waited on till �e was dead
(Which couldn�t �elp �im much),
But many grateful things �e �s said
To me for doin� such.
Ah there, Piet! whose time �as come to die,
�Is carcase past rebellion, but �is eyes inquirin� why.
Though dressed in stolen uniform with badge o� rank complete,
I�ve known a lot o� fellers go a dam� sight worse than Piet.

An� when there was n�t aught to do
But camp and cattle-guards,
I�ve fought with �im the �ole day through
At fifteen �undred yards;
Long afternoons o� lyin� still,
An� �earin� as you lay
The bullets swish from �ill to �ill
Like scythes among the �ay.
Ah there, Piet!-be�ind �is stony kop.
With �is Boer bread an� biltong, an� �is flask of awful Dop;
�Is Mauser for amusement an� �is pony for retreat,
I�ve known a lot o� fellers shoot a dam� sight worse than Piet.

He�s shoved �is rifle �neath my nose
Before I�d time to think,
An� borrowed all my Sunday clo�es
An� sent me �ome in pink;
An� I �ave crept (Lord, �ow I�ve crept!)
On �ands an� knees I�ve gone,
And spoored and floored and caught and kept
An� sent him to Ceylon!
Ah there, Piet!, you�ve sold me many a pup,
When week on week alternate it was you an� me ��ands up! �
But though I never made you walk man-naked in the �eat,
I�ve known a lot of fellows stalk a dam� sight worse than Piet.

From Plewman�s to Marabastad,
From Ookiep to De Aar,
Me an� my trusty friend �ave �ad,
As you might say, a war;
But seein� what both parties done
Before �e owned defeat,
I ain�t more proud of �avin� won,
Than I am pleased with Piet.
Ah there, Piet!, picked up be�ind the drive!
The wonder wasn�t �ow �e fought, but �ow �e kep� alive,
With nothin� in �is belly, on �is back, or to �is feet,
I�ve known a lot o� men behave a dam� sight worse than Piet.

No more I�ll �ear �is rifle crack
Along the block�ouse fence,
The beggar�s on the peaceful tack,
Regardless of expense;
For countin� what �e eats an� draws,
An� gifts an� loans as well,
�E�s gettin� �alf the Earth, because
�E didn�t give us �Ell!
Ah there, Piet! with your brand-new English plough,
Your gratis tents an� cattle, an� your most ungrateful frow,
You�ve made the British taxpayer rebuild your country seat,
I�ve known some pet battalions charge a dam� sight less than Piet.
