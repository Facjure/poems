title: I Meant To Do My Work To-Day
---

I meant to do my work to-day - 
But a brown bird sang in the apple-tree,
And a butterfly flitted across the field,
And all the leaves were calling me.

And the wind went sighing over the land,
Tossing the grasses to and fro,
And a rainbow held out its shining hand - 
So what could I do but laugh and go?
