title: Maid Of The Wilderness

 Maid of the wilderness,
 Sweet in thy rural dress,
 Fond thy rich lips I press
 Under this tree.

 Morning her health bestows,
 Sprinkles dews on the rose,
 That by the bramble grows:
 Maid happy be.
 Womanhood round thee glows,
 Wander with me.

 The restharrow blooming,
 The sun just a-coming,
 Grass and bushes illuming,
 And the spreading oak tree;

 Come hither, sweet Nelly,
 * * *
 The morning is loosing
 Its incense for thee.
 The pea-leaf has dews on;
 Love wander with me.

 We'll walk by the river,
 And love more than ever;
 There's nought shall dissever
 My fondness from thee.

 Soft ripples the water,
 Flags rustle like laughter,
 And fish follow after;
 Leaves drop from the tree.
 Nelly, Beauty's own daughter,
 Love, wander with me.
