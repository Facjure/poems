 He.

What can a man do when a woman's perverse,
 And determined to have her own way?

She.

At the altar you took me for better or worse:
 Am I worse than you took me for--say,
 Silly elf?--
 Am I worse than you took me for, say?

 He.

For an angel I took you in beauty and worth--
 The PRIEST a mere woman has given!

She.

A MAN would prefer a true woman on earth,
 To all the bright angels in heaven--
 Silly elf!--
 To all the bright angels in heaven!

 He.

You are ever ready my feelings to hurt
 At the veriest trifle, of course.

She.

Forgetting a button to sew on your shirt
 You deem a good ground for divorce--
 Silly elf!--
 You deem a good ground for divorce!

 He.

Well, marriage a lottery is, and a blank
 Some men surely draw all their lives.

She.

Such fellows as you, sir, themselves have to thank;
 Good husbands make always good wives--
 Silly elf!--
 GOOD HUSBANDS MAKE ALWAYS GOOD WIVES!
