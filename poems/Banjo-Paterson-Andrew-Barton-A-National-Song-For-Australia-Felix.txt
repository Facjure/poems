title: A National Song For Australia Felix
---

Dark over the face of Nature sublime!
Reign�d tyranny, warfare, and every crime;
The world a desert�no oasis green
A man-loving soul on its surface had seen;
Then mercy above a mandate sent forth
An Eden to form�a refuge for worth.
From the ocean it came, with halo so bright,
Want, strife, and oppression were lost in its sight.

 Chorus

 First isle of the sea�brightest gem of the earth
 In thee every virtue and joy shall have birth.
 A land of the just, the brave, and the free,
 Australia the happy, thou ever shalt be.

So earth in the flood no place for rest gave,
At length a green isle arose from the wave;
The dove o�er the waters the olive branch bore,
To show that one spot was cover�d no more;

Australia thus shall be sounded by fame,
And Europe shall echo the glorious name;
The brave, wise, and good, wherever oppress�d,
Shall fly to thy shores as a haven of rest.

 Chorus: First isle of the sea, &amp;c.

Land of the orange, fig, olive, and vine;
�Midst earth�s fairest daughters the chaplet is thine;
No sick�ning vapours are borne on thy air,
But fragrance and melody twine sweetly there;
Thy ever-green fields proclaim plenty and peace,
If man doth his part, heaven sends the increase;
No customs to fetter, no enemy near,
Independence thy sons for ever must cheer.

 Chorus: First isle of the sea, &amp;c.
