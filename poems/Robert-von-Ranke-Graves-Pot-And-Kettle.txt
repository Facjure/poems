title: Pot And Kettle.

 Come close to me, dear Annie, while I bind a lover's knot.
 A tale of burning love between a kettle and a pot.
 The pot was stalwart iron and the kettle trusty tin,
 And though their sides were black with smoke they bubbled love within.

 Forget that kettle, Jamie, and that pot of boiling broth,
 I know a dismal story of a candle and a moth.
 For while your pot is boiling and while your kettle sings
 My moth makes love to candle flame and burns away his wings.

 Your moth, I envy, Annie, that died by candle flame,
 But here are two more lovers, unto no damage came.
 There was a cuckoo loved a clock and found her always true.
 For every hour they told their hearts, "Ring! ting!Cuckoo!Cuckoo!"

 As the pot boiled for the kettle, as the kettle for the pot,
 So boils my love within me till my breast is glowing hot.
 As the moth died for the candle, so could I die for you.
 And my fond heart beats time with yours and cries, "Cuckoo!Cuckoo!"
