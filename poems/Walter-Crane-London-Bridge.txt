London Bridge is broken down,
Dance over my Ladye Lea;
London Bridge is broken down:
With a gay ladye.

How shall we build it up again?
Dance over my Ladye Lea;
How shall we build it up again?
With a gay ladye.

Silver and gold will be stole away,
Dance over my Ladye Lea;
Silver and gold will be stole away:
With a gay ladye.

Iron and steel will bend and bow,
Dance over my Ladye Lea;
Iron and steel will bend and bow:
With a gay ladye.

Wood and clay will wash away,
Dance over my Ladye Lea;
Wood and clay will wash away:
With a gay ladye.

Build it up with stone so strong,
Dance over my Ladye Lea;
Huzza! 'twill last for ages long.
With a gay ladye.
