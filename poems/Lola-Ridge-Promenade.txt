 Undulant rustlings,
 Of oncoming silk,
 Rhythmic, incessant,
 Like the motion of leaves...
 Fragments of color
 In glowing surprises...
 Pink inuendoes
 Hooded in gray
 Like buds in a cobweb
 Pearled at dawn...
 Glimpses of green
 And blurs of gold
 And delicate mauves
 That snatch at youth...
 And bodies all rosily
 Fleshed for the airing,
 In warm velvety surges
 Passing imperious, slow...

Women drift into the limousines
That shut like silken caskets
On gems half weary of their glittering...
Lamps open like pale moon flowers...
Arcs are radiant opals
Strewn along the dusk...
No common lights invade.
And spires rise like litanies - 
Magnificats of stone
Over the white silence of the arcs,
Burning in perpetual adoration.
