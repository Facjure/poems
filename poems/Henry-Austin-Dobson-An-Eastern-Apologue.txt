(To E. H. P.)


Melik the Sult�n, tired and wan,
Nodded at noon on his div�n.

Beside the fountain lingered near
JAM�L the bard, and the vizier--

Old Y�SUF, sour and hard to please;
Then JAM�L sang, in words like these.

Slim is Butheina--slim is she
As boughs of the Ar�ka tree!

"Nay," quoth the other, teeth between,
"Lean, if you will,--I call her lean."

Sweet is Butheina--sweet as wine,
With smiles that like red bubbles shine!

"True,--by the Prophet!" Y�SUF said,
"She makes men wander in the head!"

Dear is Butheina--ah! more dear
Than all the maidens of Kashmeer!

"Dear," came the answer, quick as thought,
"Dear ... and yet always to be bought."

So JAM�L ceased. But still Life's page
Shows diverse unto YOUTH and AGE:

And,--be the song of Ghouls or Gods,--
TIME, like the Sult�n, sits ... and nods.
