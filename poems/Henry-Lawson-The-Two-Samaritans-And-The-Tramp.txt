title: The Two Samaritans And The Tramp
---

A tramp was trampin� on the road,
The afternoon was warm an� muggy,
And by-and-by he chanced to meet
A parsin ridin� in a buggy.
Said he: �As follerers ov the Loard,
To do good offices we oughter!�
An� from a water-bag he poured,
An� guv the tramp, a drink er water.

The parsin he went rattlin� �ome
To ware his fam-i-lee was thrivin�,
The tramp went on until he met
A bullick-driver, bullick drivin�,
�It�s bilin� �ot,� the driver sed
As soon�s the dirty tramp drawed nearer,
And from a little keg he poured,
And giv the tramp a pint of beer, �ah!�

(P.S., The �ah� is meant to stand for the tramp a-drinking ov it.)

I ain�t agin the temperance cause,
Nor yet no advocate ov drinkin�,
I only tells the yarn because,
Well, at the time it somehow seemed
Ter kind ov set me thinkin�.
