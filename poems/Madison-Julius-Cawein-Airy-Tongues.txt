I.

 I hear a song the wet leaves lisp
 When Morn comes down the woodland way;
 And misty as a thistle-wisp
 Her gown gleams windy gray;
 A song, that seems to say,
 "Awake! 'tis day!"

 I hear a sigh, when Day sits down
 Beside the sunlight-lulled lagoon;
 While on her glistening hair and gown
 The rose of rest is strewn;
 A sigh, that seems to croon,
 "Come sleep! 'tis noon!"

 I hear a whisper, when the stars,
 Upon some evening-purpled height,
 Crown the dead Day with nenuphars
 Of dreamy gold and white;
 A voice, that seems t' invite,
 "Come love! 'tis night!"


II.

 Before the rathe song-sparrow sings
 Among the hawtrees in the lane,
 And to the wind the locust flings
 Its early clusters fresh with rain;
 Beyond the morning-star, that swings
 Its rose of fire above the spire,
 Between the morning's watchet wings,
 A voice that rings o'er brooks and boughs
 "Arouse! arouse!"

 Before the first brown owlet cries
 Among the grape-vines on the hill,
 And in the dam with half-shut eyes
 The lilies rock above the mill;
 Beyond the oblong moon, that flies
 Its pearly flower above the tower,
 Between the twilight's primrose skies,
 A voice that sighs from east to west
 "To rest! to rest!"
