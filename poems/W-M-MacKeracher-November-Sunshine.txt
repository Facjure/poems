O affluent Sun, unwilling to abate
 Thy bounteous hospitality benign,
Whenas we deemed the banquet o'er, thy great
 Gold flagon brims again with amber wine;
Whenas we thought t' have seen on plain and hill
 Thy euthanasia in October's haze,
The blessing of thy light, unstinted still,
 Irradiates the drear November days.

Naught can discourage thee, O thurifer
 Of gladness to the else benighted face
Of the misfeatured earth; fit minister
 Of Him whose love illumines every place,
Who pours His mercy forth without demur
 Over the sins and sorrows of our race.
