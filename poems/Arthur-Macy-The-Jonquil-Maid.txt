title: The Jonquil Maid
---

 A little Maid sat in a Jonquil Tree,
 Singing alone,
 In a low love-tone,
 And the wind swept by with a wistful moan;
 For he longed to stay
 With the Maid all day;
 But he knew
 As he blew
 It was true
 That the dew
 Would never, never dry
 If the wind should die;
 So he hurried away where the rosebuds grew.
 And while to the Land of the Rose went he,
 Singing alone,
 In a low love-tone,
 A Little Maid sat in a Jonquil Tree.

 The Little Maid's eyes had a rainbow hue,
 And her sunset hair
 Was woven with care
 In a knot that was fit for a Psyche to wear;
 And she pressed her lips
 With her finger tips,
 Threw a sly
 Kiss to try
 If he'd sigh
 In reply,
 And said with a laugh,
 "Oh, it's not one half
 As sweet as I give when there's Some One nigh."
 And while to the Rosebud Land went he,
 Singing alone,
 In a low love-tone,
 A Little Maid sat in a Jonquil Tree.

 The wind swept back to the Jonquil Tree
 At the close of day,
 In the twilight gray;
 But the sweet Little Maid had stolen away;
 And whither she's flown
 Will never be known
 Till the Rose
 As it blows
 Shall disclose
 All it knows
 Of the Maid so fair
 With the sunset hair.
 And the sad wind comes and sighs and goes,
 And dreams of the day when he blew so free,
 When singing alone,
 In a low love-tone,
 A Little Maid sat in a Jonquil Tree.
