title: To The Nightingale, Which The Author Heard Sing On New Year�s Day.
---

Whence is it that, amazed, I hear
From yonder wither�d spray,
This foremost morn of all the year,
The melody of May?


And why, since thousands would be proud
Of such a favour shown,
Am I selected from the crowd
To witness it alone?


Sing�st thou, sweet Philomel, to me,
For that I also long
Have practised in the groves like thee,
Though not like thee in song?


Or sing�st thou, rather, under force
Of some divine command,
Commission�d to presage a course
Of happier days at hand?


Thrice welcome then! for many a long
And joyless year have I,
As thou to-day, put forth my song
Beneath a wintry sky.


But thee no wintry skies can harm,
Who only need�st to sing
To make e�en January charm,
And every season spring.
