As thoï¿½ again, yea, even once again,
We should rewelcome to our stewardship
The rider with the loose-flung bridle-rein
And chance-plucked twig for whip,

The down-turned hat-brim, and the eyes beneath
Alert, devouring, and the imperious hand
Ordaining matters swiftly to bequeath
Perfect the work he planned.
