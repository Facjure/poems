O life has its seasons joyous and drear,
 Its summer sun and its winter snow,
But the fairest of all, I tell you, dear,
 Was the sweet old spring of the long ago - 
 The ever and ever so long ago - 

When we walked together among the flowers,
 When the world with beauty was all aglow.
O the rain and dew! O the shine and showers
 Of the sweet old spring of the long ago!
 The ever and ever so long ago.

A hunger for all of the past delight
 Is stirred by the winds that softly blow.
Can you spare me a thought from heaven to-night
 For the sweet old spring of the long ago? - 
 The ever and ever so long ago.
