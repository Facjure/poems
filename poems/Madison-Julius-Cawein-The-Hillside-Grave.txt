 Ten-hundred deep the drifted daisies break
 Here at the hill's foot; on its top, the wheat
 Hangs meagre-bearded; and, in vague retreat,
 The wisp-like blooms of the moth-mulleins shake.
 And where the wild-pink drops a crimson flake,
 And morning-glories, like young lips, make sweet
 The shaded hush, low in the honeyed heat,
 The wild-bees hum; as if afraid to wake
 One sleeping there; with no white stone to tell
 The story of existence; but the stem
 Of one wild-rose, towering o'er brier and weed,
 Where all the day the wild-birds requiem;
 Within whose shade the timid violets spell
 An epitaph, only the stars can read.
