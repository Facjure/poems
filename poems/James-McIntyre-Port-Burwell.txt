The following lines were given at a concert when Port Burwell was a busy port and there had been a race on the ice the day before.


In winter time who here resort,
To pay a visit to your busy port,
They must be clad in fur well,
For it blows cold at Burwell;
But when you wish to trot your horse
You make Lake Erie your race course,
And we believe at every heat
All other horses you do beat.
