 They who have seen the noble Roman's scorn
 Break forth at thought of laying down his head,
 When the blank day is over, garroted
 In his ancestral palace, where, from morn
 To night, the desecrated floors are worn
 By feet of purse-proud strangers; they who have read
 In one meek smile, beneath a peasant's shed,
 How patiently the weight of wrong is borne;
 They who have heard some learned Patriot treat
 Of freedom, with mind grasping the whole theme
 From ancient Rome, downwards through that bright dream
 Of Commonwealths, each city a star-like seat
 Of rival glory; they, fallen Italy
 Nor must, nor will, nor can, despair of Thee!
