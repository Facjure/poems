There�s a trade you all know well�
It�s bringing cattle over�
I�ll tell you all about the time
When I became a drover.
I made up my mind to try the spec,
To the Clarence I did wander,
And bought a mob of duffers there
To begin as an overlander.

 Chorus

 Pass the wine cup round, my boys;
 Don�t let the bottle stand there,
 For to-night we�ll drink the health
 Of every overlander.

Next morning counted the cattle
Saw the outfit ready to start,
Saw all the lads well mounted,
And their swags put in a cart.

All kinds of men I had
From France, Germany, and Flanders;
Lawyers, doctors, good and bad,
In the mob of overlanders.

Next morning I set out
When the grass was green and young;
And they swore they�d break my snout
If I did not move along.
I said, �You�re very hard;
Take care, don�t raise my dander,
For I�m a regular knowing card,
The Queensland overlander.�

�Tis true we pay no license,
And our run is rather large;
�Tis not often they can catch us,
So they cannot make a charge.
They think we live on store beef,
But no, I�m not a gander;
When a good fat stranger joins the mob,
�He�ll do,� says the overlander.

One day a squatter rode up.
Says he, �You�re on my run;
I�ve got two boys as witnesses.
Consider your stock in pound.�

I tried to coax, then bounce him,
But my tin I had to squander,
For he put threepence a head
On the mob of the overlander.

The pretty girls in Brisbane
Were hanging out their duds.
I wished to have a chat with them,
So steered straight for the tubs.
Some dirty urchins saw me,
And soon they raised my dander,
Crying, �Mother, quick! take in the clothes,
Here comes an overlander!�

In town we drain the wine cup,
And go to see the play,
And never think to be hard up
For how to pass the day.
Each has a sweetheart there,
Dressed out in all her grandeur�
Dark eyes and jet black flowing hair.
�She�s a plum,� says the overlander.
