O Heart of Three-in-the evening,
 You nestled the thorn-crowned head;
He leaned on you in His sorrow,
 And rested on you when dead.

Ah! Holy Three-in-the evening
 He gave you His richest dower;
He met you afar on Calvary,
 And made you "His own last hour".

O Brow of Three-in-the evening,
 Thou wearest a crimson crown;
Thou art Priest of the hours forever,
 And thy voice, as thou goest down

The cycles of time, still murmurs
 The story of love each day:
"I held in death the Eternal,
 In the long and the far-away."

O Heart of Three-in-the evening,
 Mine beats with thine to-day;
Thou tellest the olden story,
 I kneel -- and I weep and pray.
