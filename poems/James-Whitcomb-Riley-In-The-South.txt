 There is a princess in the South
About whose beauty rumors hum
 Like honey-bees about the mouth
Of roses dewdrops falter from;
 And O her hair is like the fine
 Clear amber of a jostled wine
 In tropic revels; and her eyes
 Are blue as rifts of Paradise.

 Such beauty as may none before
Kneel daringly, to kiss the tips
 Of fingers such as knights of yore
Had died to lift against their lips:
 Such eyes as might the eyes of gold
 Of all the stars of night behold
 With glittering envy, and so glare
 In dazzling splendor of despair.

 So, were I but a minstrel, deft
At weaving, with the trembling strings
 Of my glad harp, the warp and weft
Of rondels such as rapture sings, -
 I'd loop my lyre across my breast,
 Nor stay me till my knee found rest
 In midnight banks of bud and flower
 Beneath my lady's lattice-bower.

 And there, drenched with the teary dews,
I'd woo her with such wondrous art
 As well might stanch the songs that ooze
Out of the mockbird's breaking heart;
 So light, so tender, and so sweet
 Should be the words I would repeat,
 Her casement, on my gradual sight,
 Would blossom as a lily might.
