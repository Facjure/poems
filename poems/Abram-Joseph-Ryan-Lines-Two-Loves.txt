title: Lines (Two Loves)

Two loves came up a long, wide aisle,
 And knelt at a low, white gate;
One -- tender and true, with the shyest smile,
 One -- strong, true, and elate.

Two lips spoke in a firm, true way,
 And two lips answered soft and low;
In one true hand such a little hand lay
 Fluttering, frail as a flake of snow.

One stately head bent humbly there,
 Stilled were the throbbings of human love;
One head drooped down like a lily fair,
 Two prayers went, wing to wing, above.

God blest them both in the holy place,
 A long, brief moment the rite was done;
On the human love fell the heavenly grace,
 Making two hearts forever one.

Between two lengthening rows of smiles,
 One sweetly shy, one proud, elate,
Two loves passed down the long, wide aisles,
 Will they ever forget the low, white gate?
