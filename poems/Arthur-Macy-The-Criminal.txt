title: The Criminal

 Crime flourishes throughout the land,
And bids defiance to the law,
 And wicked deeds on every hand
O'erwhelm our souls with awe!

 I know one hardened criminal
Whose maidenhood with crime begins;
 Who, safe behind a prison wall,
Should expiate her sins.

 She is a thief whene'er she smiles,
For then she steals my heart from me,
 And keeps it with a maiden's wiles,
And never sets it free.

 She plunders sighs from humankind,
She pilfers tears I would not weep,
 She robs me of my peace of mind,
And she purloins my sleep.

 Of lawless ways she stands confessed,
And is a burglar bold whene'er
 She finds a weakness in my breast,
And slyly enters there.

 A gambler she, whose arts entrance,
Whose victims yield without demur;
 Content to play Love's game of chance
And lose their hearts to her.

 A graver crime is hers; for, when
Her matchless beauty I admire,
 Of arson she is guilty then,
And sets my heart on fire.

 A bandit, preying on mankind,
Her captives by the score increase;
 No hand can e'er their chains unbind,
No ransom bring release.

 She is a cruel murderess
Whene'er her eyes send forth a dart,
 And as she holds me in duress
It stabs me to the heart.

 Crime flourishes throughout the land,
And bids defiance to the law,
 And wicked deeds on every hand
O'erwhelm our souls with awe!
