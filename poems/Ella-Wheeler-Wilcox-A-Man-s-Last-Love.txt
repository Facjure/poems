title: A Man's Last Love
---

Like the tenth wave, that offers to the shore
Accumulated opulence and force,
So does my heart, which thought it loved of yore,
 Carry increasing passion down the course
Of time to proffer thee.
 Oh! not the faint
 First ripple of the sea should be its pride,
But the great climax of its unrestraint,
 Which culminates in one commanding tide.

The lesser billows of each crude emotion
 Break on life's strand, recede, and then unite
With love's large sea; and to some late devotion
 Unrecognised, they bring their lost delight.
So all the vanished fancies of my past
Live yet in this one passion, grand and vast.
