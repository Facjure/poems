By her white bed I muse a little space:
She fell asleep - not very long ago, - 
And yet the grass was here and not the snow - 
The leaf, the bud, the blossom, and - her face! - 
Midsummer's heaven above us, and the grace
Of Lovers own day, from dawn to afterglow;
The fireflies' glimmering, and the sweet and low
Plaint of the whip-poor-wills, and every place
In thicker twilight for the roses' scent.
Then night. - She slept - in such tranquility,
I walk atiptoe still, nor dare to weep,
Feeling, in all this hush, she rests content - 
That though God stood to wake her for me, she
Would mutely plead: "Nay, Lord!Let him so sleep."
