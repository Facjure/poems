 Sad o'er the hills the poppy sunset died.
 Slow as a fungus breaking through the crusts
 Of forest leaves, the waning half-moon thrusts,
 Through gray-brown clouds, one milky silver side;
 In her vague light the dogwoods, vale-descried,
 Seem nervous torches flourished by the gusts;
 The apple-orchards seem the restless dusts
 Of wind-thinned mists upon the hills they hide.
 It is a night of omens whom late May
 Meets, like a wraith, among her train of hours;
 An apparition, with appealing eye
 And hesitant foot, that walks a willowed way,
 And, speaking through the fading moon and flowers,
 Bids her prepare her gentle soul to die.
