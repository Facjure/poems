 We thank you for a noble work well done.
 There is a kindness - ('tis the truer one;
The better part the simpler heart doth know),
 The care to give the day a brighter sun

 To these, the nameless crowd that drags on slow
 The common toil, the common weary woe
The world cares nought for. But your work secures
 Thro' union strength and self-respect that grow.

 There is a courage that unflawed endures
 The sneer, the slander of earth's epicures.
And here are grateful women's hearts to show
 This kindness and this courage, both are yours!
