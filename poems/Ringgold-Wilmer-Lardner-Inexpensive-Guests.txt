I wonder how 'twould make you feel,
 My fellow food providers,
To have as guests at ev'ry meal
 Three - count 'em, three - outsiders.

Well, that's the case with me, but still
 I don't complain or holler,
For, strange to say, the groc'ry bill
 Has not gone up a dollar.

These guests of ours, to make it brief,
 Can't really chew or swallow;
They're merely dolls, called Indian Chief,
 And Funny Man, and Rollo.
