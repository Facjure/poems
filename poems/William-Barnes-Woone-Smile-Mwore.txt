title: Woone Smile Mwore
---

O! MARY, when the zun went down, 
Woone night in spring, w� viry rim, 
Behind the nap wi� woody crown, 
An� left your smilen face so dim; 
Your little sister there, inside,
Wi� bellows on her little knee, 
Did blow the vire, a-glearen wide 
Drough window-panes, that I could zee,
As you did stan� wi� me, avore 
The house, a-parten, woone smile mwore.
 
The chatt�ren birds, a-risen high, 
An� zinken low, did swiftly vlee 
Vrom shrinken moss, a-growen dry, 
Upon the lanen apple tree. 
An� there the dog, a-whippen wide
His hairy tail, an� comen near, 
Did fondly lay agan you zide 
His coal-black nose an� russet ear: 
To win what I �d a-won avore, 
Vrom your gay; face, his woone smile mwore.

An� while your mother bustled sprack, 
A-getten supper out in hall, 
An� cast her shade, a-whiv�ren black 
Avore the vire, upon the wall; 
Your brother come, wi� easy pace, 
In drough the slammen gate, along 
The path, wi� healthy-bloomen face, 
A-whis�len shrill his last new zong: 
An� when he come avore the door, 
He met vrom you his woone smile mwore. 
 
Now you that wer the daughter there, 
Be mother on a husband�s vloor, 
An� mid ye meet wi� less o� care 
Than what your harty mother bore; 
An� if abroad I have to rue 
The bitter tongue, or wrongvul deed, 
Mid I come hwome to share wi� you 
What �s needvul free o� pinchen need: 
An� vind that you ha� still in store 
My evenen meal, an� woone smile mwore.
