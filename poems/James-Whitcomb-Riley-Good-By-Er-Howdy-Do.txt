title: Good-By Er Howdy-Do
---

 Say good-by er howdy-do -
 What's the odds betwixt the two?
 Comin' - goin', ev'ry day -
 Best friends first to go away -
 Grasp of hands you'd ruther hold
 Than their weight in solid gold
 Slips their grip while greetin' you. -
 Say good-by er howdy-do!

 Howdy-do, and then, good-by -
 Mixes jes' like laugh and cry;
 Deaths and births, and worst and best,
 Tangled their contrariest;
 Ev'ry jinglin' weddin'-bell
 Skeerin' up some funer'l knell. -
 Here's my song, and there's your sigh. -
 Howdy-do, and then, good-by!

 Say good-by er howdy-do -
 Jes' the same to me and you;
 'Taint worth while to make no fuss,
 'Cause the job's put up on us!
 Some One's runnin' this concern
 That's got nothin' else to learn:
 Ef He's willin', we'll pull through -
 Say good-by er howdy-do!
