title: Grace And Providence.
---

Almighty King! whose wondrous hand
Supports the weight of sea and land,
Whose grace is such a boundless store,
No heart shall break that sighs for more.


Thy providence supplies my food,
And �tis thy blessing makes it good;
My soul is nourish�d by thy word,
Let soul and body praise the Lord.


My streams of outward comfort came
From him who built this earthly frame;
Whate�er I want his bounty gives,
By whom my soul for ever lives.


Either his hand preserves from pain,
Or, if I feel it, heals again;
From Satan�s malice shields my breast,
Or overrules it for the best.


Forgive the song that falls so low
Beneath the gratitude I owe!
It means thy praise, however poor;
An angel�s song can do no more.
