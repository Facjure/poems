title: An Impetuous Resolve
---

When little Dickie Swope's a man,
 He's go' to be a Sailor;
An' little Hamey Tincher, he's
 A-go' to be a Tailor:
Bud Mitchell, he's a-go' to be
 A stylish Carriage-Maker;
An' when I grow a grea'-big man,
 I'm go' to be a Baker!

An' Dick'll buy his sailor-suit
 O' Hame; and Hame'll take it
An' buy as fine a double-rigg
 As ever Bud can make it:
An' nen all three'll drive roun' fer me
 An' we'll drive off togevver,
A-slingin' pie-crust 'long the road
 Ferever an' ferever!
