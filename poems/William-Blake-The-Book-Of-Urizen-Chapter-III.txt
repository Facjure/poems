title: The Book Of Urizen: Chapter III
---

I

The voice ended, they saw his pale visage
Emerge from the darkness; his hand
On the rock of eternity unclasping
The Book of brass. Rage siez'd the strong

II

Rage, fury, intense indignation
In cataracts of fire blood &amp; gall
In whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke:
And enormous forms of energy;
All the seven deadly sins of the soul
In living creations appear'd
In the flames of eternal fury.

III

Sund'ring, dark'ning, thund'ring!
Rent away with a terrible crash
Eternity roll'd wide apart
Wide asunder rolling
Mountainous all around
Departing; departing; departing:
Leaving ruinous fragments of life
Hanging frowning cliffs &amp; all between
An ocean of voidness unfathomable.

IV

The roaring fires ran o'er the heav'ns
In whirlwinds &amp; cataracts of blood
And o'er the dark desarts of Urizen
Fires pour thro' the void on all sides
On Urizens self-begotten armies.

V

But no light from the fires. all was darkness
In the flames of Eternal fury

VI

In fierce anguish &amp; quenchless flames
To the desarts and rocks He ran raging
To hide, but He could not: combining
He dug mountains &amp; hills in vast strength,
He piled them in incessant labour,
In howlings &amp; pangs &amp; fierce madness
Long periods in burning fires labouring
Till hoary, and age-broke, and aged,
In despair and the shadows of death.

VII

And a roof, vast petrific around,
On all sides He fram'd: like a womb;
Where thousands of rivers in veins
Of blood pour down the mountains to cool
The eternal fires beating without
From Eternals; &amp; like a black globe
View'd by sons of Eternity, standing
On the shore of the infinite ocean
Like a human heart strugling &amp; beating
The vast world of Urizen appear'd.

VIII

And Los round the dark globe of Urizen,
Kept watch for Eternals to confine,
The obscure separation alone;
For Eternity stood wide apart,
As the stars are apart from the earth

IX

Los wept howling around the dark Demon:
And cursing his lot; for in anguish,
Urizen was rent from his side;
And a fathomless void for his feet;
And intense fires for his dwelling.

X

But Urizen laid in a stony sleep
Unorganiz'd, rent from Eternity

XI

The Eternals said: What is this? Death
Urizen is a clod of clay.

XII

Los howld in a dismal stupor,
Groaning! gnashing! groaning!
Till the wrenching apart was healed

XIII

But the wrenching of Urizen heal'd not
Cold, featureless, flesh or clay,
Rifted with direful changes
He lay in a dreamless night

XIV

Till Los rouz'd his fires, affrighted
At the formless unmeasurable death.
