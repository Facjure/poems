title: The Fairy In Winter
---

 There was a Fairy - flake of winter - 
 Who, when the snow came, whispering, Silence,
 Sister crystal to crystal sighing,
 Making of meadow argent palace,
Night a star-sown solitude,
 Cried 'neath her frozen eaves, "I burn here!"

 Wings diaphanous, beating bee-like,
 Wand within fingers, locks enspangled,
 Icicle foot, lip sharp as scarlet,
 She lifted her eyes in her pitch-black hollow - 
 Green as stalks of weeds in water - 
 Breathed: stirred.

 Rilled from her heart the ichor, coursing,
 Flamed and awoke her slumbering magic.
 Softlier than moth's her pinions trembled;
 Out into blackness, light-like, she flittered,
 Leaving her hollow cold, forsaken.

 In air, o'er crystal, rang twangling night-wind.
 Bare, rimed pine-woods murmured lament.
