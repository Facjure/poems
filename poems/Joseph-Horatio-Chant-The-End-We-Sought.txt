title: The End We Sought
---

The end we sought is not attained,
But wisdom has been won,
And thus a higher goal is gained.
That like the moon has sadly waned,
While this shines as the sun.

A shorter route to India's strand
Columbus failed to find.
That was an object truly grand,
But in the wealth of this fair land
Grandeur and good combine.
