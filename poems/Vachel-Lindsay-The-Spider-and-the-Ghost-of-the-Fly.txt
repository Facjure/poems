title: The Spider and the Ghost of the Fly
---

	 Once I loved a spider
	 When I was born a fly,
	 A velvet-footed spider
	 With a gown of rainbow-dye.
	 She ate my wings and gloated.
	 She bound me with a hair.
	 She drove me to her parlor
	 Above her winding stair.
	 To educate young spiders
	 She took me all apart.
	 My ghost came back to haunt her.
	 I saw her eat my heart.
