(See Note 37)

"Forward! forward!"
 Rang our fathers' battle-cry.
"Forward! forward!"
 Norsemen, be our watchword high!
All that fires the spirit and makes the heart's faith bright,
 For that we forward go with might
And faithful fight.

"Forward! forward!"
 Whoso loves a home that's free.
"Forward! forward!"
 Freedom's course must ever be.
Though it shall be tested by doubt and by defeat,
 Who will the losses' count repeat
When vict'ries greet?

"Forward! forward!"
 Whoso trusts in Norway's day.
"Forward! forward!"
 Whoso goes our fathers' way.
Hid in Northern mountains are spirit-treasures true
 They shall, when dawns the morning's blue,
Come forth anew.
