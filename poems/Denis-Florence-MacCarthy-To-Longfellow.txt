I.

Pensive within the Colosseum's walls
 I stood with thee, O Poet of the West! - 
 The day when each had been a welcome guest
 In San Clemente's venerable halls: - 
Ah, with what pride my memory now recalls
 That hour of hours, that flower of all the rest,
 When with thy white beard falling on thy breast - 
 That noble head, that well might serve as Paul's
In some divinest vision of the saint
 By Raffael dreamed, I heard thee mourn the dead - 
 The martyred host who fearless there, though faint,
Walked the rough road that up to Heaven's gate led:
 These were the pictures Calderon loved to paint
 In golden hues that here perchance have fled.


II.

Yet take the colder copy from my hand,
 Not for its own but for THE MASTER'S sake, - 
 Take it, as thou, returning home, wilt take
 From that divinest soft Italian land
Fixed shadows of the Beautiful and Grand
 In sunless pictures that the sun doth make - 
 Reflections that may pleasant memories wake
 Of all that Raffael touched, or Angelo planned: - 
As these may keep what memory else might lose,
 So may this photograph of verse impart
 An image, though without the native hues
Of Calderon's fire, and yet with Calderon's art,
 Of what Thou lovest through a kindred Muse
 That sings in heaven, yet nestles in the heart.
