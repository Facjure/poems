2. Help us, dear Lord God.
1. From all sins,
From all error,
From all evil,
2. Defend us, dear Lord God.
1. From the deceit and wiles of the devil,
From violent, sudden death,
From pestilence and famine,
From war and bloodshed,
From uproar and discord,
From fire and flood,
From hail and tempest,
From the eternal death,
2. Defend us, dear Lord God.
1. Through thy holy birth,
Through thy death-struggle and bloody sweat,
Through thy cross and death,
2. Help us, dear Lord God.
1. Through thy holy resurrection and ascension,
In our final distress,
At the last judgement,
2. Help us, dear Lord God.
1. We poor sinners pray
2. That thou wouldst hear us, dear Lord God!
1. And thy holy Church govern and lead.
All bishops, parsons, and clerks, keep in the wholesome word and holy life.
All factions and offences prevent.
All that wander and all that are led astray, bring back.
Tread Satan under our feet.
Into thy harvest send forth true labourers.
Give to the word thy spirit and power.
All that are troubled and faint-hearted help and comfort them.
To all kings and princes give peace and concord.
To our emperor grant constant victory over his enemies.
Our governors, and all their mighty ones, guide and defend.
Our council, school, and congregation, bless and protect.
To all in distress and on a journey, appear with help.
To all that are with child and that give suck, grant happy result and good success.
All children and sick persons foster and tend.
All prisoners loose and unburden.
All widows and orphans defend and provide for.
Take pity upon all men.
Our enemies, persecutors, and slanderers, forgive and convert.
The fruits of the earth give and preserve;
And graciously hear us.
2. Hear us, dear Lord God.
1. O Jesus Christ, God's Son,
2. Have pity upon us.
1. O thou Lamb of God, that bearest the sins of the world,
2. Have pity upon us.
1. O thou Lamb of God, that bearest the sins of the world,
2. Have pity upon us.
1. O thou Lamb of God, that bearest the sins of the world,
2. Grant us lasting peace.
1. Christ, 2. Hear us.
1. Lord,2. Have pity,
1. Christ, 2. Have pity,
 1. 2. Lord, have pity. Amen.
