The sky is like a blue jellyfish.
And all around are fields, rolling meadows - 
Peaceful world, you great mousetrap,
Would that I might finally escape from you..O if I had wings - 
One plays dice.Guzzles.Chatters about future countries.
Each person puts in his own two cents.
The earth is a succulent Sunday roast,
Nicely dunked into a sweet sun-sauce.
If only there were a wind... that ripped
The gentle world with iron claws.That would amuse me.
But if a storm comes...It would shred
The lovely blue eternal sky into a thousand pieces.
