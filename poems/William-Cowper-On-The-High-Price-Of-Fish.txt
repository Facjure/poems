title: On The High Price Of Fish.
---

Cocoa-nut naught,
Fish too dear,
None must be bought
For us that are here:


No lobster on earth,
That ever I saw,
To me would be worth
Sixpence a claw.


So, dear madam, wait
Till fish can be got
At a reasï¿½nable rate,
Whether lobster or not;


Till the French and the Dutch
Have quitted the seas,
And then send as much
And as oft as you please.
