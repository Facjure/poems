Obscured the sun, the world is dark;
Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc,
 Send down thy spark.

Let every heart in France be stirred,
By such an all-compelling word
 As thou once heard.

Say to each soul, 'Lo! I am near;
My voice still speaks in accents clear.
 Be still and hear.

'The France I saved can not be lost;
Though tempest-torn and terror-tossed,
 Count not the cost.

'Give as the maid of Domremy
Gave all - gave life itself to see
 Her country free.

'Back of great France my spirit towers
To aid her through the darkest hours
 With God's own powers!'

Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc,
Shine through the night, speak through the dark
 The while we hark.
