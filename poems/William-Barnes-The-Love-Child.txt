Where the bridge out at Woodley did stride,
Wi' his wide arches' cool she�ded bow,
Up above the clear brook that did slide
By the poppies, befoam'd white as snow;
As the gilcups did quiver among
The white de�sies, a-spread in a sheet.
There a quick-tripp�n ma�d come along,
Aye, a girl wi' her light-stepp�n veet.


An' she cried "I do pra�, is the road
Out to Lincham on here, by the me�d?"
An' "oh! ees," I me�de answer, an' show'd
Her the way it would turn an' would le�d:
"Goo along by the beech in the nook,
Where the children do pla� in the cool,
To the stepp�n stwones over the brook,
Aye, the grey blocks o' rock at the pool."


"Then you don't seem a-born an' a-bred,"
I spoke up, "at a place here about;"
And she answer'd wi' che�ks up so red
As a pi'ny le�te a-come out,
"No, I liv'd wi' my uncle that died
Back in E�pril, an' now I'm a-come
Here to Ham, to my mother, to bide,
Aye, to her house to vind a new hwome."


I'm ashe�med that I wanted know
Any more of her childhood or life
But then, why should so fe�ir a child grow
Where no father did bide wi' his wife;
Then wi' blushes of zunris�n morn,
She replied "that it midden be known,
"Oh! they zent me awa� to be born,
Aye, they hid me when some would be shown."


Oh! it me�de me a'most teary-ey'd,
An' I vound I a'most could ha' groan'd
What! so winn�n, an' still cast azide
What! so lovely, an' not to be own'd;
Oh! a God-gift a-treated wi' scorn
Oh! a child that a squier should own;
An' to zend her awa� to be born!
Aye, to hide her where others be shown!
