Upon her breast her hands and hair
 Were tangled all together.
The moon of June forbade me not - 
 The golden night time weather
In balmy sighs commanded me
 To kiss them like a feather.

Her looming hair, her burning hands,
 Were tangled black and white.
My face I buried there.I pray - 
 So far from her to-night - 
For grace, to dream I kiss her soul
 Amid the black and white.
