Didn�t know Flynn,
Flynn of Virginia,
Long as he�s been �yar?
Look �ee here, stranger,
Whar hev you been?

Here in this tunnel
He was my pardner,
That same Tom Flynn,
Working together,
In wind and weather,
Day out and in.

Didn�t know Flynn!
Well, that is queer;
Why, it�s a sin
To think of Tom Flynn,
Tom with his cheer,
Tom without fear,
Stranger, look �yar!

Thar in the drift,
Back to the wall,
He held the timbers
Ready to fall;
Then in the darkness
I heard him call:
�Run for your life, Jake!
Run for your wife�s sake!
Don�t wait for me.�
And that was all
Heard in the din,
Heard of Tom Flynn,
Flynn of Virginia.

That�s all about
Flynn of Virginia.
That lets me out.
Here in the damp,
Out of the sun,
That �ar derned lamp
Makes my eyes run.
Well, there, I�m done!

But, sir, when you�ll
Hear the next fool
Asking of Flynn,
Flynn of Virginia,
Just you chip in,
Say you knew Flynn;
Say that you�ve been �yar.
