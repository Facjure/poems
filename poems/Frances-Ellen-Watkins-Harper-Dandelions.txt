 Welcome children of the Spring,
 In your garbs of green and gold,
 Lifting up your sun-crowned heads
 On the verdant plain and wold.

 As a bright and joyous troop
 From the breast of earth ye came
 Fair and lovely are your cheeks,
 With sun-kisses all aflame.

 In the dusty streets and lanes,
 Where the lowly children play,
 There as gentle friends ye smile,
 Making brighter life's highway

 Dewdrops and the morning sun,
 Weave your garments fair and bright,
 And we welcome you to-day
 As the children of the light.

 Children of the earth and sun.
 We are slow to understand
 All the richness of the gifts
 Flowing from our Father's hand.


 Were our vision clearer far,
 In this sin-dimmed world of ours,
 Would we not more thankful be
 For the love that sends us flowers?

 Welcome, early visitants,
 With your sun-crowned golden hair,
 With your message to our hearts
 Of our Father's loving care.
