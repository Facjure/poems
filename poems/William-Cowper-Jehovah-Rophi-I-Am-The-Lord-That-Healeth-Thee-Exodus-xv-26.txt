Heal us, Emmanuel, here we are,
Waiting to feel thy touch:
Deep-wounded souls to thee repair,
And, Saviour, we are such.


Our faith is feeble, we confess,
We faintly trust thy word;
But wilt thou pity us the less?
Be that far from thee, Lord!


Remember him who once applied,
With trembling, for relief;
�Lord, I believe,� with tears he cried,[1]
�Oh, help my unbelief!�


She too, who touch�d thee in the press,
And healing virtue stole,
Was answer�d, �Daughter, go in peace,[2]
Thy faith hath made thee whole.�


Conceal�d amid the gathering throng,
She would have shunn�d thy view;
And if her faith was firm and strong,
Had strong misgivings too.


Like her, with hopes and fears we come,
To touch thee, if we may;
Oh! send us not despairing home,
Send none unheal�d away.
