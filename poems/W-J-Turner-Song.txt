Gently, sorrowfully sang the maid
 Sowing the ploughed field over,
And her song was only:
 'Come, O my lover!'

Strangely, strangely shone the light,
 Stilly wound the river:
'Thy love is a dead man,
 He'll come back never.'

Sadly, sadly passed the maid
The fading dark hills over;
 Still her song far, far away said:
 'Come, O my lover!'
