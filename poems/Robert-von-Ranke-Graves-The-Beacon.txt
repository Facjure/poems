 The silent shepherdess,
 She of my vows,
 Here with me exchanging love
 Under dim boughs.

 Shines on our mysteries
 A sudden spark, 
 "Dout the candle, glow-worm,
 Let all be dark.

 "The birds have sung their last notes,
 The Sun's to bed,
 Glow-worm, dout your candle."
 The glow-worm said:

 "I also am a lover;
 The lamp I display
 Is beacon for my true love
 Wandering astray.

 "Through the thick bushes
 And the grass comes she
 With a heartload of longing
 And love for me.

 "Sir, enjoy your fancy,
 But spare me harm,
 A lover is a lover,
 Though but a worm."
