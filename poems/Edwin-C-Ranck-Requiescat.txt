 Oh weep fair South, and bow thy head
For one is gone beyond recall!
 Cast flowers on the sainted dead
Who sleeps beneath a funeral pall.
To the sound of muffled drum,
To the sound of muffled drum.

 She saw a noble husband's fame
Grow more enduring with the years,
 And in the land his honored name
Loom brighter through a mist of tears,
But the sound of muffled drum!
O the sound of muffled drum!

 Our fate is but to meet and part
Upon Life's dark and troubled sea,
 Yet recollection stirs the heart,
Of men in gray who used to be,
But the sound of muffled drum!
O the sound of muffled drum!

 Brave South, 'tis but a moment's pause
E'er on that dim and distant shore,
 The heroes of thy Fallen Cause
Will meet again to part no more
To the sound of muffled drum.
To the sound of muffled drum.
