I

We work here together
 In blast and breeze;
He fills the earth in,
 I hold the trees.

He does not notice
 That what I do
Keeps me from moving
 And chills me through.

He has seen one fairer
 I feel by his eye,
Which skims me as though
 I were not by.

And since she passed here
 He scarce has known
But that the woodland
 Holds him alone.

I have worked here with him
 Since morning shine,
He busy with his thoughts
 And I with mine.

I have helped him so many,
 So many days,
But never win any
 Small word of praise!

Shall I not sigh to him
 That I work on
Glad to be nigh to him
 Though hope is gone?

Nay, though he never
 Knew love like mine,
I'll bear it ever
 And make no sign!

II

From the bundle at hand here
 I take each tree,
And set it to stand, here
 Always to be;
When, in a second,
 As if from fear
Of Life unreckoned
 Beginning here,
It starts a sighing
 Through day and night,
Though while there lying
 'Twas voiceless quite.

It will sigh in the morning,
 Will sigh at noon,
At the winter's warning,
 In wafts of June;
Grieving that never
 Kind Fate decreed
It should for ever
 Remain a seed,
And shun the welter
 Of things without,
Unneeding shelter
 From storm and drought.

Thus, all unknowing
 For whom or what
We set it growing
 In this bleak spot,
It still will grieve here
 Throughout its time,
Unable to leave here,
 Or change its clime;
Or tell the story
 Of us to-day
When, halt and hoary,
 We pass away.
