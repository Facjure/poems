Take a pair of sparkling eyes,
Hidden, ever and anon,
In a merciful eclipse 
Do not heed their mild surprise 
Having passed the Rubicon.
Take a pair of rosy lips;
Take a figure trimly planned 
Such as admiration whets
(Be particular in this);
Take a tender little hand,
Fringed with dainty fingerettes,
Press it in parenthesis; 
Take all these, you lucky man 
Take and keep them, if you can.

Take a pretty little cot 
Quite a miniature affair 
Hung about with trellised vine,
Furnish it upon the spot
With the treasures rich and rare
I've endeavored to define.
Live to love and love to live
You will ripen at your ease,
Growing on the sunny side 
Fate has nothing more to give.
You're a dainty man to please
If you are not satisfied.
Take my counsel, happy man:
Act upon it, if you can!
