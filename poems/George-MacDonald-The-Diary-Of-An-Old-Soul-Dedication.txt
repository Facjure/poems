title: The Diary Of An Old Soul. - Dedication

 Sweet friends, receive my offering. You will find
 Against each worded page a white page set:--
 This is the mirror of each friendly mind
 Reflecting that. In this book we are met.
 Make it, dear hearts, of worth to you indeed:--
 Let your white page be ground, my print be seed,
 Growing to golden ears, that faith and hope shall feed.

 YOUR OLD SOUL
