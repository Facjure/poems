 . . . So I walked among the willows very quietly all night;
 There was no moon at all, at all; no timid star alight;
 There was no light at all, at all; I wint from tree to tree,
 And I called him as his mother called, but he nivver answered me.

 Oh I called him all the night-time, as I walked the wood alone;
 And I listened and I listened, but I nivver heard a moan;
 Then I found him at the dawnin', when the sorry sky was red:
 I was lookin' for the livin', but I only found the dead.

 Sure I know that it was Shamus by the silver cross he wore;
 But the bugles they were callin', and I heard the cannon roar.
 Oh I had no time to tarry, so I said a little prayer,
 And I clasped his hands together, and I left him lyin' there.

 Now the birds are singin', singin', and I'm home in Donegal,
 And it's Springtime, and I'm thinkin' that I only dreamed it all;
 I dreamed about that evil wood, all crowded with its dead,
 Where I knelt beside me brother when the battle-dawn was red.

 Where I prayed beside me brother ere I wint to fight anew:
 Such dreams as these are evil dreams; I can't believe it's true.
 Where all is love and laughter, sure it's hard to think of loss . . .
 But mother's sayin' nothin', and she clasps - A SILVER CROSS.
