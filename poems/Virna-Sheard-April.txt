 April! April! April!
 With a mist of green on the trees - 
And a scent of the warm brown broken earth
 On every wandering breeze;
What, though thou be changeful,
 Though thy gold turns to grey again,
There's a robin out yonder singing,
 Singing in the rain.

 April! April! April!
 'Tis the Northland hath longed for thee,
She hath gazed toward the South with aching eyes
 Full long and patiently.
Come now - tell us, sweeting,
 Thou laggard so lovely and late,
Dost know there's no joy like the joy that comes
 When hearts have learned to wait?
