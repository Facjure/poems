(See Note 64)

 Molde, Molde,
 True as a song,
Billowy rhythms whose thoughts fill with love me,
Follow thy form in bright colors above me,
 Bear thy beauty along.
Naught is so black as thy fjord, when storm-lashes
Sea-salted scourge it and inward it dashes,
Naught is so mild as thy strand, as thine islands,
 Ah, as thine islands!
Naught is so strong as thy mountain-linked ring,
Naught is so sweet as thy summer-nights bring.
 Molde, Molde,
 True as a song,
Murm'ring memories throng.

 Molde, Molde,
 Flower-o'ergrown,
Houses and gardens where good friends wander!
Hundreds of miles away, - but I'm yonder
 'Mid the roses full-blown.
Strong shines the sun on that mountain-rimmed beauty,
Fast is the fight, let each man do his duty.
Friends, who your favor would never begrudge me,
 Gently now judge me! - 
Only with life ends the fight for the right.
Thought flees to you for a refuge in light.
 Molde, Molde,
 Flower-o'ergrown,
Childhood's memories' throne.

Oh, may at last
 In thine embrace, life's fleeting
Conflict past,
 Glad thine evening-glory greeting,
 - Where life let thought awaken, - 
 My thought by death be taken!
