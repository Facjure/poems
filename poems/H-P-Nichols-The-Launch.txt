Come, sister Ellen, get your hat
And come away with me;
My boat, all rigged with mast and sail,
I want you so to see!

Do you upon the landing stand,
While here I'll kneel and blow,
So that the little "Water-witch"
Beneath the arch may go.

There! there! she's off! how fast she goes
Across the river wide!
I'd love to sit in her myself,
And o'er the water glide.

When I'm a man I'll have a boat,
And every sunny day,
We'll take a long and pleasant sail,
Till daylight fades away.
