If I could see a little fish 
That is what I just now wish!
I want to see his great round eyes
Always open in surprise.

I wish a water rat would glide
Slowly to the other side;
Or a dancing spider sit
On the yellow flags a bit.

I think I'll get some stones to throw,
And watch the pretty circles show.
Or shall we sail a flower-boat,
And watch it slowly slowly float?

That's nice because you never know
How far away it means to go;
And when to-morrow comes, you see,
It may be in the great wide sea.
