 How dear to my heart are the scenes of my childhood
That now but in mem'ry I sadly review;
 The old meeting-house at the edge of the wildwood,
The rail fence, and horses all tethered thereto;
 The low, sloping roof, and the bell in the steeple,
The doves that came fluttering out overhead
 As it solemnly gathered the God-fearing people
To hear the old Bible my grandfather read.
 The old-fashioned Bible -
The dust-covered Bible -
The leathern-bound Bible my grandfather read.

 The blessed old volume! The face bent above it -
As now I recall it - is gravely severe,
 Though the reverent eye that droops downward to love it
Makes grander the text through the lens of a tear,
 And, as down his features it trickles and glistens,
The cough of the deacon is stilled, and his head
 Like a haloed patriarch's leans as he listens
To hear the old Bible my grandfather read.
 The old-fashioned Bible -
The dust-covered Bible -
The leathern-bound Bible my grandfather read.

 Ah! who shall look backward with scorn and derision
And scoff the old book though it uselessly lies
 In the dust of the past, while this newer revision
Lisps on of a hope and a home in the skies?
 Shall the voice of the Master be stifled and riven?
Shall we hear but a tithe of the words He has said,
 When so long He has, listening, leaned out of Heaven
To hear the old Bible my grandfather read?
 The old-fashioned Bible -
The dust-covered Bible -
The leathern-bound Bible my grandfather read.
