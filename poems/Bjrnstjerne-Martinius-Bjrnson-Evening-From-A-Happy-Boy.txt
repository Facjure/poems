title: Evening (From A Happy Boy)
---

Evening sun in beauty is shining,
Lazy puss on the step's reclining.
"Two small mice,
Cream that was so nice,
Four fine bits of fish,
Stolen from a dish,
And I'm so good and full,
And I'm so lazy and dull!"
Says the pussy.

Mother-hen her wings now is sinking,
Rooster stands on one leg a-thinking:
"That gray goose,
High he flies and loose;
But just watch, you must admit,
Naught he has of rooster-wit.
Chickens in! To the coop away!
Gladly dismiss we the sun for today!"
Says the rooster.

"Dear me, it is good to be living,
When life no labor is giving!"
Says the song-bird.
