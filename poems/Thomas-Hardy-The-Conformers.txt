 Yes; we'll wed, my little fay,
 And you shall write you mine,
And in a villa chastely gray
 We'll house, and sleep, and dine.
 But those night-screened, divine,
 Stolen trysts of heretofore,
We of choice ecstasies and fine
 Shall know no more.

 The formal faced cohue
 Will then no more upbraid
With smiting smiles and whisperings two
 Who have thrown less loves in shade.
 We shall no more evade
 The searching light of the sun,
Our game of passion will be played,
 Our dreaming done.

 We shall not go in stealth
 To rendezvous unknown,
But friends will ask me of your health,
 And you about my own.
 When we abide alone,
 No leapings each to each,
But syllables in frigid tone
 Of household speech.

 When down to dust we glide
 Men will not say askance,
As now: "How all the country side
 Rings with their mad romance!"
 But as they graveward glance
 Remark: "In them we lose
A worthy pair, who helped advance
 Sound parish views."
