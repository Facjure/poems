 La Gitanilla! tall dragoons
 In Andalusian afternoons,
 With ogling eye and compliment
 Smiled on you, as along you went
 Some sleepy street of old Seville;
 Twirled with a military skill
 Moustaches; buttoned uniforms
 Of Spanish yellow bowed your charms.

 Proud, wicked head and hair blue-black!
 Whence your mantilla, half thrown back,
 Discovered shoulders and bold breast
 Bohemian brown: and you were dressed - 
 In some short skirt of gipsy red
 Of smuggled stuff; thence stockings dead
 White silk exposed with many a hole
 Thro' which your plump legs roguish stole
 A fleshly look; and tiny toes
 In red morocco shoes with bows
 Of scarlet ribbons. Daintily
 You walked by me and I did see
 Your oblique eyes, your sensuous lip,
 That gnawed the rose you once did flip
 At bashful Jose's nose while loud
 Laughed the guant guards among the crowd.
 And, in your brazen chemise thrust,
 Heaved with the swelling of your bust,
 That bunch of white acacia blooms
 Whiffed past my nostrils hot perfumes.

 As in a cool neveria
 I ate an ice with M�rim�e,
 Dark Carmencita, you passed gay,
 All holiday bedizen�d,
 A new mantilla on your head;
 A crimson dress bespangled fierce;
 And crescent gold, hung in your ears,
 Shone wrought Morisco; and each shoe
 Cordovan leather, spangled blue,
 Glanced merriment; and from large arms
 To well-turned ancles all your charms
 Blew flutterings and glitterings
 Of satin bands and beaded strings;
 And 'round each arm's fair thigh one fold,
 And graceful wrists, a twisted gold
 Coiled serpents, tails fixed in the head,
 Convulsive-jeweled glossy red.
 In flowers and trimmings to the jar
 Of mandolin and low guitar
 You in the grated patio
 Danced; the curled coxcombs' flirting row
 Rang pleased applause. I saw you dance,
 With wily motion and glad glance
 Voluptuous, the wild romalis,
 Where every movement was a kiss
 Of elegance delicious, wound
 In your Basque tambourine's dull sound.
 Or as the ebon castanets
 Clucked out dry time in unctuous jets,
 Saw angry Jose thro' the grate
 Glare on us a pale face of hate,
 When some indecent colonel there
 Presumed too lewdly for his ear.

 Some still night in Seville; the street,
 Candilejo; two shadows meet - 
 Flash sabres; crossed within the moon, - 
 Clash rapidly - a dead dragoon.
