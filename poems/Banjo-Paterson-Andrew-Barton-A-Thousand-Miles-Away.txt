 (Air: �Ten Thousand Miles Away.�)


Hurrah for the Roma railway! Hurrah for Cobb and Co.,
And oh! for a good fat horse or two to carry me Westward Ho�
To carry me Westward Ho! my boys, that�s where the cattle stray
On the far Barcoo, where they eat nardoo, a thousand miles away.

Chorus

 Then give your horses rein across the open plain,
 We�ll ship our meat both sound and sweet, nor care what some folks say;
 And frozen we�ll send home the cattle that now roam
 On the far Barcoo and the Flinders too, a thousand miles away.

Knee-deep in grass we�ve got to pass�for the truth I�m bound to tell�
Where in three weeks the cattle get as fat as they can swell�

As fat as they can swell, my boys; a thousand pounds they weigh,
On the far Barcoo, where they eat nardoo, a thousand miles away.

 Chorus: Then give your horses rein, &amp;c.

No Yankee hide e�er grew outside such beef as we can freeze;
No Yankee pastures make such steers as we send o�er the seas�
As we send o�er the seas, my boys, a thousand pounds they weigh�
From the far Barcoo, where they eat nardoo, a thousand miles away.

 Chorus: Then give your horses rein, &amp;c.
