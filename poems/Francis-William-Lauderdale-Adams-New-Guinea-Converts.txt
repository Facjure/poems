 I saw them as they were born,
Erect and fearless and free,
 Facing the sun and the wind
Of the hills and the sea.

 I saw them naked, superb,
Like the Greeks long ago,
 With shield and spear and arrow
Ready to strike and throw.

 I saw them as they were made
By the Christianizing crows,
 Blinking, stupid, clumsy
In their greasy ill-cut clothes:

 I heard their gibbering cant,
And they sung those hymns that smell
 Of poor souls besotted, degraded
With the fear of "God" and "hell."

 And I thought if Jesus could see them,
He who loved the freedom, the light,
 And loathed those who compassed heaven
And earth for one proselyte,

 To make him, etcetera, etcetera, - 
Then this sight, as on me or you,
 Would act on him like an emetic,
And he'd have to go off and spue.

 O Jesus, O man of the People,
Who died to abolish all this - 
 The pharisee rank and respectable,
The scribe and the greedy priest - 

 O Jesus, O sacred Socialist,
You would die again of shame,
 If you were alive and could see
What things are done in your name.
