 Come hither, my dear one, my choice one, and rare one,
 And let us be walking the meadows so fair,
 Where on pilewort and daisies the eye fondly gazes,
 And the wind plays so sweet in thy bonny brown hair.

 Come with thy maiden eye, lay silks and satins by;
 Come in thy russet or grey cotton gown;
 Come to the meads, dear, where flags, sedge, and reeds appear,
 Rustling to soft winds and bowing low down.

 Come with thy parted hair, bright eyes, and forehead bare;
 Come to the whitethorn that grows in the lane;
 To banks of primroses, where sweetness reposes,
 Come, love, and let us be happy again.

 Come where the violet flowers, come where the morning showers
 Pearl on the primrose and speedwell so blue;
 Come to that clearest brook that ever runs round the nook
 Where you and I pledged our first love so true.
