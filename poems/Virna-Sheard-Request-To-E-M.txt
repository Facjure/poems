Sing me a song - a song to ease old sorrows,
 And dull the edge of care - 
A song of Hope to ring through all the morrows
 That be my share.

Unlock the doors where joy hath been in hiding,
 Though barred they be and strong,
And send black grief far down the wind a-riding - 
 Sing me a song.

Sing thou thy sky-lark song of sweetest daring,
 And April ecstasy,
That I may follow it and go a-faring
 To Arcady.

Charm sleep from out the shadows with thy singing,
 And when the light turns grey,
Leave me bright dreams until the dawn comes bringing
 The rose-edged day.

The wind of March taught thee his springtime madness,
 And then in undertone
Whispered the wonder-secret of his gladness
 To thee alone.

And thou hast learned from little brook and river
 Their tender melody - 
The notes that set the thrush's throat a-quiver
 Are known to thee.

Sing me a song - a song to ease old sorrows,
 And dull the edge of care - 
A song of Hope, to ring through all the morrows
 That be my share.
