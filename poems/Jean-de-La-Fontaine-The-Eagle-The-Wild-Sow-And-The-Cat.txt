[1]

 A certain hollow tree
 Was tenanted by three.
 An eagle held a lofty bough,
 The hollow root a wild wood sow,
 A female cat between the two.
 All busy with maternal labours,
 They lived awhile obliging neighbours.
 At last the cat's deceitful tongue
 Broke up the peace of old and young.
 Up climbing to the eagle's nest,
 She said, with whisker'd lips compress'd,
 'Our death, or, what as much we mothers fear,
 That of our helpless offspring dear,
 Is surely drawing near.
 Beneath our feet, see you not how
 Destruction's plotted by the sow?
 Her constant digging, soon or late,
 Our proud old castle will uproot.
 And then - O, sad and shocking fate! - 
 She'll eat our young ones, as the fruit!
 Were there but hope of saving one,
 'Twould soothe somewhat my bitter moan.'
 Thus leaving apprehensions hideous,
 Down went the puss perfidious
 To where the sow, no longer digging,
 Was in the very act of pigging.
 'Good friend and neighbour,' whisper'd she,
 'I warn you on your guard to be.
 Your pigs should you but leave a minute,
 This eagle here will seize them in it.
 Speak not of this, I beg, at all,
 Lest on my head her wrath should fall.'
 Another breast with fear inspired,
 With fiendish joy the cat retired.
 The eagle ventured no egress
 To feed her young, the sow still less.
 Fools they, to think that any curse
 Than ghastly famine could be worse!
 Both staid at home, resolved and obstinate,
 To save their young ones from impending fate, - 
 The royal bird for fear of mine,
 For fear of royal claws the swine.
 All died, at length, with hunger,
 The older and the younger;
 There staid, of eagle race or boar,
 Not one this side of death's dread door; - 
 A sad misfortune, which
 The wicked cats made rich.
 O, what is there of hellish plot
 The treacherous tongue dares not!
 Of all the ills Pandora's box[2] outpour'd,
 Deceit, I think, is most to be abhorr'd.
