 Even such the contrast that, where'er we move,
 To the mind's eye Religion doth present;
 Now with her own deep quietness content;
 Then, like the mountain, thundering from above
 Against the ancient pine-trees of the grove
 And the Land's humblest comforts. Now her mood
 Recalls the transformation of the flood,
 Whose rage the gentle skies in vain reprove;
 Earth cannot check. O terrible excess
 Of headstrong will! Can this be Piety?
 No, some fierce Maniac hath usurped her name;
 And scourges England struggling to be free:
 Her peace destroyed! her hopes a wilderness!
 Her blessings cursed, her glory turned to shame!
