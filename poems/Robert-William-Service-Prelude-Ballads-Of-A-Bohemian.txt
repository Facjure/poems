title: Prelude: Ballads Of A Bohemian
---

 Alas! upon some starry height,
 The Gods of Excellence to please,
 This hand of mine will never smite
 The Harp of High Serenities.
 Mere minstrel of the street am I,
 To whom a careless coin you fling;
 But who, beneath the bitter sky,
 Blue-lipped, yet insolent of eye,
 Can shrill a song of Spring;
 A song of merry mansard days,
 The cheery chimney-tops among;
 Of rolics and of roundelays
 When we were young . . . when we were young;
 A song of love and lilac nights,
 Of wit, of wisdom and of wine;
 Of Folly whirling on the Heights,
 Of hunger and of hope divine;
 Of Blanche, Suzette and Celestine,
 And all that gay and tender band
 Who shared with us the fat, the lean,
 The hazard of Illusion-land;
 When scores of Philistines we slew
 As mightily with brush and pen
 We sought to make the world anew,
 And scorned the gods of other men;
 When we were fools divinely wise,
 Who held it rapturous to strive;
 When Art was sacred in our eyes,
 And it was Heav'n to be alive. . . .

 O days of glamor, glory, truth,
 To you to-night I raise my glass;
 O freehold of immortal youth,
 Bohemia, the lost, alas!
 O laughing lads who led the romp,
 Respectable you've grown, I'm told;
 Your heads you bow to power and pomp,
 You've learned to know the worth of gold.
 O merry maids who shared our cheer,
 Your eyes are dim, your locks are gray;
 And as you scrub I sadly fear
 Your daughters speed the dance to-day.
 O windmill land and crescent moon!
 O Columbine and Pierrette!
 To you my old guitar I tune
 Ere I forget, ere I forget. . . .

 So come, good men who toil and tire,
 Who smoke and sip the kindly cup,
 Ring round about the tavern fire
 Ere yet you drink your liquor up;
 And hear my simple songs of earth,
 Of youth and truth and living things;
 Of poverty and proper mirth,
 Of rags and rich imaginings;
 Of cock-a-hoop, blue-heavened days,
 Of hearts elate and eager breath,
 Of wonder, worship, pity, praise,
 Of sorrow, sacrifice and death;
 Of lusting, laughter, passion, pain,
 Of lights that lure and dreams that thrall . . .
 And if a golden word I gain,
 Oh, kindly folks, God save you all!
 And if you shake your heads in blame . . .
 Good friends, God love you all the same.
