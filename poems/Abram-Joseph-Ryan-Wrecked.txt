title: Wrecked
---

The winds are singing a death-knell
 Out on the main to-night;
The sky droops low -- and many a bark
 That sailed from harbors bright,
Like many an one before,
Shall enter port no more:
And a wreck shall drift to some unknown shore
 Before to-morrow's light.

The clouds are hanging a death-pall
 Over the sea to-night;
The stars are veiled -- and the hearts that sailed
 Away from harbors bright,
Shall sob their last for their quiet home --
And, sobbing, sink 'neath the whirling foam
 Before the morning's light.

The waves are weaving a death-shroud
 Out on the main to-night;
Alas! the last prayer whispered there
 By lips with terror white!
Over the ridge of gloom,
Not a star will loom!
God help the souls that will meet their doom
 Before the dawn of light!

 *****

The breeze is singing a joy song
 Over the sea to-day;
The storm is dead and the waves are red
 With the flush of the morning's ray;
And the sleepers sleep, but beyond the deep
The eyes that watch for the ships shall weep
 For the hearts they bore away.
