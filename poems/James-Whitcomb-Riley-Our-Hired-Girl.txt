Our hired girl, she's 'Lizabuth Ann;
 An' she can cook best things to eat!
She ist puts dough in our pie-pan,
 An' pours in somepin' 'at's good and sweet,
An' nen she salts it all on top
With cinnamon; an' nen she'll stop
 An' stoop an' slide it, ist as slow,
In th' old cook-stove, so's 'twon't slop
 An' git all spilled; nen bakes it, so
 It's custard pie, first thing you know!
An' nen she'll say:
 "Clear out o' my way!
 They's time fer work, an' time fer play! -
Take yer dough, an' run, Child; run!
Er I cain't git no cookin' done!"

When our hired girl 'tends like she's mad,
 An' says folks got to walk the chalk
When she's around, er wisht they had,
 I play out on our porch an' talk
To th' Raggedy Man 'at mows our lawn;
An' he says "Whew!" an' nen leans on
 His old crook-scythe, and blinks his eyes
An' sniffs all around an' says, - "I swawn!
 Ef my old nose don't tell me lies,
 It 'pears like I smell custard-pies!"
An' nen he'll say, -
 "'Clear out' o' my way!
 They's time fer work an' time fer play!
Take yer dough, an' run, Child; run!
Er she cain't git no cookin' done!'"

Wunst our hired girl, one time when she
 Got the supper, an' we all et,
An' it was night, an' Ma an' me
 An' Pa went wher' the "Social" met, -
An' nen when we come home, an' see
A light in the kitchen-door, an' we
 Heerd a maccordeum, Pa says "Lan' -
O'Gracious! who can her beau be?"
 An' I marched in, an' 'Lizabuth Ann
 Wuz parchin' corn fer the Raggedy Man!
Better say
 "Clear out o' the way!
 They's time fer work, an' time fer play!
Take the hint, an' run, Child; run!
Er we cain't git no courtin' done!'"
