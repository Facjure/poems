To-day I had a burial of my dead.
 There was no shroud, no coffin, and no pall,
No prayers were uttered and no tears were shed -
 I only turned a picture to the wall.

A picture that had hung within my room
 For years and years; a relic of my youth.
It kept the rose of love in constant bloom
 To see those eyes of earnestness and truth.

At hours wherein no other dared intrude,
 I had drawn comfort from its smiling grace.
Silent companion of my solitude,
 My soul held sweet communion with that face.

I lived again the dream so bright, so brief,
 Though wakened as we all are by some Fate;
This picture gave me infinite relief,
 And did not leave me wholly desolate.

To-day I saw an item, quite by chance,
 That robbed me of my pitiful poor dole:
A marriage notice fell beneath my glance,
 And I became a lonely widowed soul.

With drooping eyes, and cheeks a burning flame,
 I turned the picture to the blank wall's gloom.
My very heart had died in me of shame,
 If I had left it smiling in my room.

Another woman's husband.So, my friend,
 My comfort, my sole relic of the past,
I bury thee, and, lonely, seek the end.
 Swift age has swept my youth from me at last.
