I saw the moon so broad and bright
Sailing high on a frosty night:

And the air swung far and far between
The silver disc and the orb of green:

While here and there a wisp of white
Cloud-film swam on the misty light:

And crusted thickly on the sky,
High and higher and yet more high,

Were golden star-points dusted through
The great, wide, silent vault of blue:

Then I said to me, God is good
And the world is fair, and where I stood

I knelt me down and bent my head,
And said my prayers, and went to bed.
