 A wild Pink nestled in a garden bed,
A rich Carnation flourished high above her,
 One day he chanced to see her pretty head
And leaned and looked again, and grew to love her.

 The Moss (her humble mother) saw with fear
The ardent glances of the princely stranger;
 With many an anxious thought and dewy tear
She sought to hide her darling from this danger.

 The gardener-guardian of this noble bud
A cruel trellis interposed between them.
 No common Pink should mate with royal blood,
He said, and sought in every way to wean them.

 The poor Pink pined and faded day by day:
Her restless lover from his prison bower
 Called in a priestly bee who passed that way,
And sent a message to the sorrowing flower.

 The fainting Pink wept as the bee drew near,
Droning his prayers, and begged him to confess her.
 Her weary mother, over-taxed by fear,
Slept, while the priest leaned low to shrive and bless her.

 But lo! ere long the tale went creeping out,
The rich Carnation and the Pink were married!
 The cunning bee had brought the thing about
While Mamma Moss in Slumber's arms had tarried.

 And proud descendants of that loving pair,
The offspring of that true and ardent passion,
 Are famous for their beauty everywhere,
And leaders in the floral world of fashion.
