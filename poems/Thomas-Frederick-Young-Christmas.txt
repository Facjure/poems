title: Christmas.

Old father Time, his cruel scythe
 Has swung full oft around,
Since last the merry Christmas, bells
 Rang out their cheerful sound.
With cruel vigor he has held
 His great, impartial sway,
And many thousands mown to earth,
 Who saw last Christmas day.

For some have left this world for aye,
 Who dwelt with us last year;
Glad voices heard amongst us then,
 We never more shall hear.
But still we'll build our Christmas fires,
 And sing our Christmas songs,
And for one day forget our griefs,
 Our failures and our wrongs.

Then ring, ye joyful bells, ring out;
 Ye crashing cymbals fall;
And for old Christmas, hale and stout,
 Sound up, ye harps and all.
Let music's loud and sweetest strain
 Beat from our hearts each ill;
Let thoughts of those assuage our pain,
 Who are around us still.

Oh, winsome maid, oh, hearty youth,
 I urge you on to glee,
For, in your innocence and truth,
 You all are dear to me.
Nor youth, nor age should cherish gloom,
 And voices oft should sing,
So give the gladsome voices room,
 And let the joy-bells ring.
