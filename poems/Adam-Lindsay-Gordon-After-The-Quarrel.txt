Laurence Raby�s Chamber. LAURENCE enters, a little the worse for liquor.

Laurence:
He never gave me a chance to speak,
And he call�d her, worse than a dog,
The girl stood up with a crimson cheek,
And I fell�d him there like a log.

I can feel the blow on my knuckles yet,
He feels it more on his brow.
In a thousand years we shall all forget
The things that trouble us now.
