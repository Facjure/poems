Ay ban tenking lots of yu,
 Little Steena Yohnson,
Ay ban sure yu love me true,
 Little Steena Yohnson.
Oder geezers lak to play
In yure yard, but yu skol say,
"Ay don't lak yu fallers, nay!"
 Little Steena Yohnson.

Some day yu skol be my vife,
 Little Steena Yohnson:
Ay ban glad, yu bet yure life,
 Little Steena Yohnson.
Ay ban vork lak nigger, tu,
Yumping 'round vith treshing crew;
Ay skol building home for yu,
 Little Steena Yohnson.

Maybe ve skol saving dough,
 Little Steena Yohnson;
Back to Norvay ve skol go,
 Little Steena Yohnson - 
Back var dis har midnight sun
Shining lak a son of a gun;
Ant yu tenk dis har ban fun,
 Little Steena Yohnson?
