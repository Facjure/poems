 Mrs. Mulligatawny said, "I'm sure it's going to rain."
 Mr. Mulligatawny said, "To me it's very plain."
 William Mulligatawny said, "It must rain, anyhow."
 Mary Mulligatawny said, "I feel it raining now."
And yet there were no clouds in sight, and 'twas a pleasant day,
But Mrs. Mulligatawny always liked to have her way.
With Mrs. Mulligatawny the family all agreed,
For all the Mulligatawnys feared her very much indeed,
 And did, whenever they were bid,
 As Mrs. Mulligatawny did,
 And tried to think, as they were taught,
 As Mrs. Mulligatawny thought.

 Mrs. Mulligatawny said, "Now two and two are three."
 Mr. Mulligatawny said, "I'm sure they ought to be."
 William Mulligatawny said, "Arithmetic is wrong."
 Mary Mulligatawny said, "It's been so all along."
Now two and two do not make three, and three they never were;
But Mrs. Mulligatawny said 'twas near enough for her.
With Mrs. Mulligatawny the family all agreed,
For all the Mulligatawnys feared her very much indeed,
 And did, whenever they were bid,
 As Mrs. Mulligatawny did,
 And tried to think, as they were taught,
 As Mrs. Mulligatawny thought.

 Mrs. Mulligatawny fell out of the world one day.
 Mr. Mulligatawny said, "I don't know what to say."
 William Mulligatawny said, "I don't know what to do."
 Mary Mulligatawny said, "I feel the same as you."
Mrs. Mulligatawny left the family sitting there.
They couldn't think, they couldn't move, because they didn't dare;
For Mrs. Mulligatawny had always thought for them,
And all the Mulligatawnys thought the same as Mrs. M.,
 And did, whenever they were bid,
 As Mrs. Mulligatawny did,
 And tried to think, as they were taught,
 As Mrs. Mulligatawny thought.
