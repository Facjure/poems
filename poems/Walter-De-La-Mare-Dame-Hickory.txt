 'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
 Here's sticks for your fire,
 Furze-twigs, and oak-twigs,
 And beech-twigs, and briar!'
 But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
 She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.

 'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
 Here's meat for your broth,
 Goose-flesh, and hare's flesh,
 And pig's trotters both!'
 But when old Dame Hickory came for to see,
 She found 'twas the voice of the false faerie.

 'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
 Here's a wolf at your door,
 His teeth grinning white,
 And his tongue wagging sore!'
 'Nay!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie!'
 But a wolf 'twas indeed, and famished was he.

 'Dame Hickory, Dame Hickory,
 Here's buds for your tomb,
 Bramble, and lavender,
 And rosemary bloom!'
 'Hush!' said Dame Hickory, 'ye false faerie,
 Ye cry like a wolf, ye do, and trouble poor me.'
