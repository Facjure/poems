I


In the jolly winters
 Of the long-ago,
It was not so cold as now -
 O! No! No!
Then, as I remember,
 Snowballs to eat
Were as good as apples now.
 And every bit as sweet!


II


In the jolly winters
 Of the dead-and-gone,
Bub was warm as summer,
 With his red mitts on, -
Just in his little waist-
 And-pants all together,
Who ever hear him growl
 About cold weather?


III


In the jolly winters
 Of the long-ago -
Was it HALF so cold as now?
 O! No! No!
Who caught his death o' cold,
 Making prints of men
Flat-backed in snow that now's
 Twice as cold again?


IV


In the jolly winters
 Of the dead-and-gone,
Startin' out rabbit-huntin' -
 Early as the dawn, -
Who ever froze his fingers,
 Ears, heels, or toes, -
Or'd 'a' cared if he had?
 Nobody knows!


V


Nights by the kitchen-stove,
 Shellin' white and red
Corn in the skillet, and
 Sleepin' four abed!
Ah! the jolly winters
 Of the long-ago!
We were not as old as now -
 O! No! No!
