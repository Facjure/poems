1.
"Oh, what have you got for dinner, Mrs. Bond?"
"There's beef in the larder, and ducks in the pond;"
"Dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come to be killed,
For you must be stuffed, and my customers filled!"

2.
"John Ostler, go fetch me a duckling or two,
John Ostler go fetch me a duckling or two;
Cry dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed,
For you must be stuffed, and my customers filled!"

3.
"I have been to the ducks that are swimming in the pond,
And they won't come to be killed, Mrs. Bond;
I cried dilly, dilly, dilly, dilly, come and be killed,
For you must be stuffed, and the customers filled!"

4.
Mrs. Bond she went down to the pond in a rage,
With plenty of onions, and plenty of sage;
She cried, "Come, little wag-tails, come, and be killed.
For you shall be stuffed, and my customers filled!"
