 Argument Of The Twenty-Second Book.


 Achilles slays Hector.



 Thus they, throughout all Troy, like hunted fawns
 Dispersed, their trickling limbs at leisure cool'd,
 And, drinking, slaked their fiery thirst, reclined
 Against the battlements. Meantime, the Greeks
 Sloping their shields, approach'd the walls of Troy,
 And Hector, by his adverse fate ensnared,
 Still stood exposed before the Sc�an gate.
 Then spake Apollo thus to Peleus' son.
 Wherefore, thyself mortal, pursuest thou me
 Immortal? oh Achilles! blind with rage,
 Thou know'st not yet, that thou pursuest a God.
 Unmindful of thy proper task, to press
 The flying Trojans, thou hast hither turn'd
 Devious, and they are all now safe in Troy;
 Yet hope me not to slay; I cannot die.
 To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift,
 Indignant. Oh, of all the Powers above
 To me most adverse, Archer of the skies!
 Thou hast beguiled me, leading me away
 From Ilium far, whence intercepted, else,
 No few had at this moment gnaw'd the glebe.
 Thou hast defrauded me of great renown,
 And, safe thyself, hast rescued them with ease.
 Ah--had I power, I would requite thee well.
 So saying, incensed he turned toward the town
 His rapid course, like some victorious steed
 That whirls, at stretch, a chariot to the goal.
 Such seem'd Achilles, coursing light the field.
 Him, first, the ancient King of Troy perceived
 Scouring the plain, resplendent as the star
 Autumnal, of all stars in dead of night
 Conspicous most, and named Orion's dog;
 Brightest it shines, but ominous, and dire
 Disease portends to miserable man;[1]
 So beam'd Achilles' armor as he flew.
 Loud wail'd the hoary King; with lifted hands
 His head he smote, and, uttering doleful cries
 Of supplication, sued to his own son.
 He, fixt before the gate, desirous stood
 Of combat with Achilles, when his sire
 With arms outstretch'd toward him, thus began.
 My Hector! wait not, oh my son! the approach
 Of this dread Chief, alone, lest premature
 Thou die, this moment by Achilles slain,
 For he is strongest far. Oh that the Gods
 Him loved as I! then, soon should vultures rend
 And dogs his carcase, and my grief should cease.
 He hath unchilded me of many a son,
 All valiant youths, whom he hath slain or sold
 To distant isles, and even now, I miss
 Two sons, whom since the shutting of the gates
 I find not, Polydorus and Lycaon,
 My children by Laoth�e the fair.
 If they survive prisoners in yonder camp,
 I will redeem them with gold and brass
 By noble Eltes to his daughter given,
 Large store, and still reserved. But should they both,
 Already slain, have journey'd to the shades,
 We, then, from whom they sprang have cause to mourn
 And mourn them long, but shorter shall the grief
 Of Ilium prove, if thou escape and live.
 Come then, my son! enter the city-gate
 That thou may'st save us all, nor in thy bloom
 Of life cut off, enhance Achilles' fame.
 Commiserate also thy unhappy sire
 Ere yet distracted, whom Saturnian Jove
 Ordains to a sad death, and ere I die
 To woes innumerable; to behold
 Sons slaughter'd, daughters ravish'd, torn and stripp'd
 The matrimonial chamber, infants dash'd
 Against the ground in dire hostility,[2]
 And matrons dragg'd by ruthless Grecian hands.
 Me, haply, last of all, dogs shall devour
 In my own vestibule, when once the spear
 Or falchion of some Greek hath laid me low.
 The very dogs fed at my table-side,
 My portal-guards, drinking their master's blood
 To drunkenness, shall wallow in my courts.
 Fair falls the warlike youth in battle slain,
 And when he lies torn by the pointed steel,
 His death becomes him well; he is secure,
 Though dead, from shame, whatever next befalls:
 But when the silver locks and silver beard
 Of an old man slain by the sword, from dogs
 Receive dishonor, of all ills that wait
 On miserable man, that sure is worst.
 So spake the ancient King, and his grey hairs
 Pluck'd with both hands, but Hector firm endured.
 On the other side all tears his mother stood,
 And lamentation; with one hand she bared,
 And with the other hand produced her breast,
 Then in wing'd accents, weeping, him bespake.
 My Hector! reverence this, and pity me
 If ever, drawing forth this breast, thy griefs
 Of infancy I soothed, oh now, my son!
 Acknowledge it, and from within the walls
 Repulse this enemy; stand not abroad
 To cope with him, for he is savage-fierce,
 And should he slay thee, neither shall myself
 Who bore thee, nor thy noble spouse weep o'er
 Thy body, but, where we can never come,
 Dogs shall devour it in the fleet of Greece.
 So they with prayers importuned, and with tears
 Their son, but him sway'd not; unmoved he stood,
 Expecting vast Achilles now at hand.
 As some fell serpent in his cave expects
 The traveller's approach, batten'd with herbs
 Of baneful juice to fury,[3] forth he looks
 Hideous, and lies coil'd all around his den,
 So Hector, fill'd with confidence untamed,
 Fled not, but placing his bright shield against
 A buttress, with his noble heart conferr'd.
 [4]Alas for me! should I repass the gate,
 Polydamas would be the first to heap
 Reproaches on me, for he bade me lead
 The Trojans back this last calamitous night
 In which Achilles rose to arms again.
 But I refused, although to have complied,
 Had proved more profitable far; since then
 By rash resolves of mine I have destroy'd
 The people, how can I escape the blame
 Of all in Troy? The meanest there will say--
 By his self-will he hath destroy'd us all.
 So shall they speak, and then shall I regret
 That I return'd ere I had slain in fight
 Achilles, or that, by Achilles slain,
 I died not nobly in defence of Troy.
 But shall I thus? Lay down my bossy shield,
 Put off my helmet, and my spear recline
 Against the city wall, then go myself
 To meet the brave Achilles, and at once
 Promise him Helen, for whose sake we strive
 With all the wealth that Paris in his fleet
 Brought home, to be restored to Atreus' sons,
 And to distribute to the Greeks at large
 All hidden treasures of the town, an oath
 Taking beside from every senator,
 That he will nought conceal, but will produce
 And share in just equality what stores
 Soever our fair city still includes?
 Ah airy speculations, questions vain!
 I may not sue to him: compassion none
 Will he vouchsafe me, or my suit respect.
 But, seeing me unarm'd, will sate at once
 His rage, and womanlike I shall be slain.
 It is no time from oak or hollow rock
 With him to parley, as a nymph and swain,
 A nymph and swain[5] soft parley mutual hold,
 But rather to engage in combat fierce
 Incontinent; so shall we soonest learn
 Whom Jove will make victorious, him or me.
 Thus pondering he stood; meantime approach'd
 Achilles, terrible as fiery Mars,
 Crest-tossing God, and brandish'd as he came
 O'er his right shoulder high the Pelian spear.
 Like lightning, or like flame, or like the sun
 Ascending, beam'd his armor. At that sight
 Trembled the Trojan Chief, nor dared expect
 His nearer step, but flying left the gates
 Far distant, and Achilles swift pursued.
 As in the mountains, fleetest fowl of air,
 The hawk darts eager at the dove; she scuds
 Aslant, he screaming, springs and springs again
 To seize her, all impatient for the prey,
 So flew Achilles constant to the track
 Of Hector, who with dreadful haste beneath
 The Trojan bulwarks plied his agile limbs.
 Passing the prospect-mount where high in air
 The wild-fig waved,[6] they rush'd along the road,
 Declining never from the wall of Troy.
 And now they reach'd the running rivulets clear,
 Where from Scamander's dizzy flood arise
 Two fountains,[7] tepid one, from which a smoke
 Issues voluminous as from a fire,
 The other, even in summer heats, like hail
 For cold, or snow, or crystal-stream frost-bound.
 Beside them may be seen the broad canals
 Of marble scoop'd, in which the wives of Troy
 And all her daughters fair were wont to lave
 Their costly raiment,[8] while the land had rest,
 And ere the warlike sons of Greece arrived.
 By these they ran, one fleeing, one in chase.
 Valiant was he who fled, but valiant far
 Beyond him he who urged the swift pursuit;
 Nor ran they for a vulgar prize, a beast
 For sacrifice, or for the hide of such,
 The swift foot-racer's customary meed,
 But for the noble Hector's life they ran.
 As when two steeds, oft conquerors, trim the goal
 For some illustrious prize, a tripod bright
 Or beauteous virgin, at a funeral game,
 So they with nimble feet the city thrice
 Of Priam compass'd. All the Gods look'd on,
 And thus the Sire of Gods and men began.
 Ah--I behold a warrior dear to me
 Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve
 For Hector, who the thighs of fatted bulls
 On yonder heights of Ida many-valed
 Burn'd oft to me, and in the heights of Troy:[9]
 But him Achilles, glorious Chief, around
 The city walls of Priam now pursues.
 Consider this, ye Gods! weigh the event.
 Shall we from death save Hector? or, at length,
 Leave him, although in battle high renown'd,
 To perish by the might of Peleus' son?
 Whom answer'd thus Pallas cerulean-eyed.
 Dread Sovereign of the storms! what hast thou said?
 Wouldst thou deliver from the stroke of fate
 A mortal man death-destined from of old?
 Do it; but small thy praise shall be in heaven.
 Then answer thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.
 Fear not, Tritonia, daughter dear! that word
 Spake not my purpose; me thou shalt perceive
 Always to thee indulgent. What thou wilt
 That execute, and use thou no delay.
 So roused he Pallas of herself prepared,
 And from the heights Olympian down she flew.
 With unremitting speed Achilles still
 Urged Hector. As among the mountain-height
 The hound pursues, roused newly from her lair
 The flying fawn through many a vale and grove;
 And though she trembling skulk the shrubs beneath,
 Tracks her continual, till he find the prey,
 So 'scaped not Hector Peleus' rapid son.
 Oft as toward the Dardan gates he sprang
 Direct, and to the bulwarks firm of Troy,
 Hoping some aid by volleys from the wall,
 So oft, outstripping him, Achilles thence
 Enforced him to the field, who, as he might,
 Still ever stretch'd toward the walls again.
 As, in a dream,[10] pursuit hesitates oft,
 This hath no power to fly, that to pursue,
 So these--one fled, and one pursued in vain.
 How, then, had Hector his impending fate
 Eluded, had not Phoebus, at his last,
 Last effort meeting him, his strength restored,
 And wing'd for flight his agile limbs anew?
 The son of Peleus, as he ran, his brows
 Shaking, forbad the people to dismiss
 A dart at Hector, lest a meaner hand
 Piercing him, should usurp the foremost praise.
 But when the fourth time to those rivulets.
 They came, then lifting high his golden scales,
 Two lots the everlasting Father placed
 Within them, for Achilles one, and one
 For Hector, balancing the doom of both.
 Grasping it in the midst, he raised the beam.
 Down went the fatal day of Hector, down
 To Ades, and Apollo left his side.
 Then blue-eyed Pallas hasting to the son
 Of Peleus, in wing'd accents him address'd.
 Now, dear to Jove, Achilles famed in arms!
 I hope that, fierce in combat though he be,
 We shall, at last, slay Hector, and return
 Crown'd with great glory to the fleet of Greece.
 No fear of his deliverance now remains,
 Not even should the King of radiant shafts,
 Apollo, toil in supplication, roll'd
 And roll'd again[11] before the Thunderer's feet.
 But stand, recover breath; myself, the while,
 Shall urge him to oppose thee face to face.
 So Pallas spake, whom joyful he obey'd,
 And on his spear brass-pointed lean'd. But she,
 (Achilles left) to noble Hector pass'd,
 And in the form, and with the voice loud-toned
 Approaching of Deiphobus, his ear
 In accents, as of pity, thus address'd.
 Ah brother! thou art overtask'd, around
 The walls of Troy by swift Achilles driven;
 But stand, that we may chase him in his turn.[12]
 To whom crest-tossing Hector huge replied.
 Deiphobus! of all my father's sons
 Brought forth by Hecuba, I ever loved
 Thee most, but more than ever love thee now,
 Who hast not fear'd, seeing me, for my sake
 To quit the town, where others rest content.
 To whom the Goddess, thus, cerulean-eyed.
 Brother! our parents with much earnest suit
 Clasping my knees, and all my friends implored me
 To stay in Troy, (such fear hath seized on all)
 But grief for thee prey'd on my inmost soul.
 Come--fight we bravely--spare we now our spears
 No longer; now for proof if Peleus' son
 Slaying us both, shall bear into the fleet
 Our arms gore-stain'd, or perish slain by thee.
 So saying, the wily Goddess led the way.
 They soon, approaching each the other, stood
 Opposite, and huge Hector thus began.
 Pelides! I will fly thee now no more.
 Thrice I have compass'd Priam's spacious walls
 A fugitive, and have not dared abide
 Thy onset, but my heart now bids me stand
 Dauntless, and I will slay, or will be slain.
 But come. We will attest the Gods; for they
 Are fittest both to witness and to guard
 Our covenant. If Jove to me vouchsafe
 The hard-earn'd victory, and to take thy life,
 I will not with dishonor foul insult
 Thy body, but, thine armor stripp'd, will give
 Thee to thy friends, as thou shalt me to mine.
 To whom Achilles, lowering dark, replied.
 Hector! my bitterest foe! speak not to me
 Of covenants! as concord can be none
 Lions and men between, nor wolves and lambs
 Can be unanimous, but hate perforce
 Each other by a law not to be changed,
 So cannot amity subsist between
 Thee and myself; nor league make I with thee
 Or compact, till thy blood in battle shed
 Or mine, shall gratify the fiery Mars.
 Rouse all thy virtue; thou hast utmost need
 Of valor now, and of address in arms.
 Escape me more thou canst not; Pallas' hand
 By mine subdues thee; now will I avenge
 At once the agonies of every Greek
 In thy unsparing fury slain by thee.
 He said, and, brandishing the Pelian ash,
 Dismiss'd it; but illustrious Hector warn'd,
 Crouched low, and, overflying him, it pierced
 The soil beyond, whence Pallas plucking it
 Unseen, restored it to Achilles' hand,
 And Hector to his godlike foe replied.
 Godlike Achilles! thou hast err'd, nor know'st
 At all my doom from Jove, as thou pretend'st,
 But seek'st, by subtlety and wind of words,
 All empty sounds, to rob me of my might.
 Yet stand I firm. Think not to pierce my back.
 Behold my bosom! if the Gods permit,
 Meet me advancing, and transpierce me there.
 Meantime avoid my glittering spear, but oh
 May'st thou receive it all! since lighter far
 To Ilium should the toils of battle prove,
 Wert thou once slain, the fiercest of her foes.
 He said, and hurling his long spear with aim
 Unerring, smote the centre of the shield
 Of Peleus' son, but his spear glanced away.
 He, angry to have sent it forth in vain,
 (For he had other none) with eyes downcast
 Stood motionless awhile, then with loud voice
 Sought from Deiphobus, white-shielded Chief,
 A second; but Deiphobus was gone.
 Then Hector understood his doom, and said.
 Ah, it is plain; this is mine hour to die.
 I thought Deiphobus at hand, but me
 Pallas beguiled, and he is still in Troy.
 A bitter death threatens me, it is nigh,
 And there is no escape; Jove, and Jove's son
 Apollo, from the first, although awhile
 My prompt deliverers, chose this lot for me,
 And now it finds me. But I will not fall
 Inglorious; I will act some great exploit
 That shall be celebrated ages hence.
 So saying, his keen falchion from his side
 He drew, well-temper'd, ponderous, and rush'd
 At once to combat. As the eagle darts
 Right downward through a sullen cloud to seize
 Weak lamb or timorous hare, so brandishing
 His splendid falchion, Hector rush'd to fight.
 Achilles, opposite, with fellest ire
 Full-fraught came on; his shield with various art
 Celestial form'd, o'erspread his ample chest,
 And on his radiant casque terrific waved
 The bushy gold of his resplendent crest,
 By Vulcan spun, and pour'd profuse around.
 Bright as, among the stars, the star of all
 Most radiant, Hesperus, at midnight moves,
 So, in the right hand of Achilles beam'd
 His brandish'd spear, while, meditating wo
 To Hector, he explored his noble form,
 Seeking where he was vulnerable most.
 But every part, his dazzling armor torn
 From brave Patroclus' body, well secured,
 Save where the circling key-bone from the neck
 Disjoins the shoulder; there his throat appear'd,
 Whence injured life with swiftest flight escapes;
 Achilles, plunging in that part his spear,
 Impell'd it through the yielding flesh beyond.
 The ashen beam his power of utterance left
 Still unimpair'd, but in the dust he fell,
 And the exulting conqueror exclaim'd.
 But Hector! thou hadst once far other hopes,
 And, stripping slain Patroclus, thought'st thee safe,
 Nor caredst for absent me. Fond dream and vain!
 I was not distant far; in yonder fleet
 He left one able to avenge his death,
 And he hath slain thee. Thee the dogs shall rend
 Dishonorably, and the fowls of air,
 But all Achaia's host shall him entomb.
 To whom the Trojan Chief languid replied.
 By thy own life, by theirs who gave thee birth,
 And by thy knees,[13] oh let not Grecian dogs
 Rend and devour me, but in gold accept
 And brass a ransom at my father's hands,
 And at my mother's an illustrious price;
 Send home my body, grant me burial rites
 Among the daughters and the sons of Troy.
 To whom with aspect stern Achilles thus.
 Dog! neither knees nor parents name to me.
 I would my fierceness of revenge were such,
 That I could carve and eat thee, to whose arms
 Such griefs I owe; so true it is and sure,
 That none shall save thy carcase from the dogs.
 No, trust me, would thy parents bring me weigh'd
 Ten--twenty ransoms, and engage on oath
 To add still more; would thy Dardanian Sire
 Priam, redeem thee with thy weight in gold,
 Not even at that price would I consent
 That she who bare should place thee on thy bier
 With lamentation; dogs and ravening fowls
 Shall rend thy body while a scrap remains.
 Then, dying, warlike Hector thus replied.
 Full well I knew before, how suit of mine
 Should speed preferr'd to thee. Thy heart is steel.
 But oh, while yet thou livest, think, lest the Gods
 Requite thee on that day, when pierced thyself
 By Paris and Apollo, thou shalt fall,
 Brave as thou art, before the Sc�an gate.
 He ceased, and death involved him dark around.
 His spirit, from his limbs dismiss'd, the house
 Of Ades sought, mourning in her descent
 Youth's prime and vigor lost, disastrous doom!
 But him though dead, Achilles thus bespake.
 Die thou. My death shall find me at what hour
 Jove gives commandment, and the Gods above.
 He spake, and from the dead drawing away
 His brazen spear, placed it apart, then stripp'd
 His arms gore-stain'd. Meantime the other sons
 Of the Achaians, gathering fast around,
 The bulk admired, and the proportion just
 Of Hector; neither stood a Grecian there
 Who pierced him not, and thus the soldier spake.
 Ye Gods! how far more patient of the touch
 Is Hector now, than when he fired the fleet!
 Thus would they speak, then give him each a stab.
 And now, the body stripp'd, their noble Chief
 The swift Achilles standing in the midst,
 The Grecians in wing'd accents thus address'd.
 Friends, Chiefs and Senators of Argos' host!
 Since, by the will of heaven, this man is slain
 Who harm'd us more than all our foes beside,
 Essay we next the city, so to learn
 The Trojan purpose, whether (Hector slain)
 They will forsake the citadel, or still
 Defend it, even though of him deprived.
 But wherefore speak I thus? still undeplored,
 Unburied in my fleet Patroclus lies;
 Him never, while alive myself, I mix
 With living men and move, will I forget.
 In Ades, haply, they forget the dead,
 Yet will not I Patroclus, even there.
 Now chanting p�ans, ye Achaian youths!
 Return we to the fleet with this our prize;
 We have achieved great glory,[14] we have slain
 Illustrious Hector, him whom Ilium praised
 In all her gates, and as a God revered.
 He said; then purposing dishonor foul
 To noble Hector, both his feet he bored
 From heel to ancle, and, inserting thongs,
 Them tied behind his chariot, but his head
 Left unsustain'd to trail along the ground.
 Ascending next, the armor at his side
 He placed, then lash'd the steeds; they willing flew
 Thick dust around the body dragg'd arose,
 His sable locks all swept the plain, and all
 His head, so graceful once, now track'd the dust,
 For Jove had given it into hostile hands
 That they might shame it in his native soil.[15]
 Thus, whelm'd in dust, it went. The mother Queen
 Her son beholding, pluck'd her hair away,
 Cast far aside her lucid veil, and fill'd
 With shrieks the air. His father wept aloud,
 And, all around, long, long complaints were heard
 And lamentations in the streets of Troy,
 Not fewer or less piercing, than if flames
 Had wrapt all Ilium to her topmost towers.
 His people scarce detain'd the ancient King
 Grief-stung, and resolute to issue forth
 Through the Dardanian gates; to all he kneel'd
 In turn, then roll'd himself in dust, and each
 By name solicited to give him way.
 Stand off, my fellow mourners! I would pass
 The gates, would seek, alone, the Grecian fleet.
 I go to supplicate the bloody man,
 Yon ravager; he may respect, perchance,
 My years, may feel some pity of my age;
 For, such as I am, his own father is,
 Peleus, who rear'd him for a curse to Troy,
 But chiefly rear'd him to myself a curse,
 So numerous have my sons in prime of youth
 Fall'n by his hand, all whom I less deplore
 (Though mourning all) than one; my agonies
 For Hector soon shall send me to the shades.
 Oh had he but within these arms expired,
 The hapless Queen who bore him, and myself
 Had wept him, then, till sorrow could no more!
 So spake he weeping, and the citizens
 All sigh'd around; next, Hecuba began
 Amid the women, thus, her sad complaint.
 Ah wherefore, oh my son! wretch that I am,
 Breathe I forlorn of thee? Thou, night and day,
 My glory wast in Ilium, thee her sons
 And daughters, both, hail'd as their guardian God,
 Conscious of benefits from thee received,
 Whose life prolong'd should have advanced them all
 To high renown. Vain boast! thou art no more.
 So mourn'd the Queen. But fair Andromache
 Nought yet had heard, nor knew by sure report
 Hector's delay without the city gates.
 She in a closet of her palace sat,
 A twofold web weaving magnificent,
 With sprinkled flowers inwrought of various hues,
 And to her maidens had commandment given
 Through all her house, that compassing with fire
 An ample tripod, they should warm a bath
 For noble Hector from the fight return'd.
 Tenderness ill-inform'd! she little knew
 That in the field, from such refreshments far,
 Pallas had slain him by Achilles' hand.
 She heard a cry of sorrow from the tower;
 Her limbs shook under her, her shuttle fell,
 And to her bright-hair'd train, alarm'd, she cried.
 Attend me two of you, that I may learn
 What hath befallen. I have heard the voice
 Of the Queen-mother; my rebounding heart
 Chokes me, and I seem fetter'd by a frost.
 Some mischief sure o'er Priam's sons impends.
 Far be such tidings from me! but I fear
 Horribly, lest Achilles, cutting off
 My dauntless Hector from the gates alone,
 Enforce him to the field, and quell perhaps
 The might, this moment, of that dreadful arm
 His hinderance long; for Hector ne'er was wont
 To seek his safety in the ranks, but flew
 First into battle, yielding place to none.
 So saying, she rush'd with palpitating heart
 And frantic air abroad, by her two maids
 Attended; soon arriving at the tower,
 And at the throng of men, awhile she stood
 Down-looking wistful from the city-wall,
 And, seeing him in front of Ilium, dragg'd
 So cruelly toward the fleet of Greece,
 O'erwhelm'd with sudden darkness at the view
 Fell backward, with a sigh heard all around.
 Far distant flew dispersed her head-attire,
 Twist, frontlet, diadem, and even the veil
 By golden Venus given her on the day
 When Hector led her from E�tion's house
 Enrich'd with nuptial presents to his home.
 Around her throng'd her sisters of the house
 Of Priam, numerous, who within their arms
 Fast held her[16] loathing life; but she, her breath
 At length and sense recovering, her complaint
 Broken with sighs amid them thus began.
 Hector! I am undone; we both were born
 To misery, thou in Priam's house in Troy,
 And I in Hypoplacian Thebes wood-crown'd
 Beneath E�tion's roof. He, doom'd himself
 To sorrow, me more sorrowfully doom'd,
 Sustain'd in helpless infancy, whom oh
 That he had ne'er begotten! thou descend'st
 To Pluto's subterraneous dwelling drear,
 Leaving myself destitute, and thy boy,
 Fruit of our hapless loves, an infant yet,
 Never to be hereafter thy delight,
 Nor love of thine to share or kindness more.
 For should he safe survive this cruel war,
 With the Achaians penury and toil
 Must be his lot, since strangers will remove
 At will his landmarks, and possess his fields.
 Thee lost, he loses all, of father, both,
 And equal playmate in one day deprived,
 To sad looks doom'd, and never-ceasing-tears.
 He seeks, necessitous his father's friends,
 One by his mantle pulls, one by his vest,
 Whose utmost pity yields to his parch'd lips
 A thirst-provoking drop, and grudges more;
 Some happier child, as yet untaught to mourn
 A parent's loss, shoves rudely from the board
 My son, and, smiting him, reproachful cries--
 Away--thy father is no guest of ours--
 Then, weeping, to his widow'd mother comes
 Astyanax, who on his father's lap
 Ate marrow only, once, and fat of lambs,[17]
 And when sleep took him, and his crying fit
 Had ceased, slept ever on the softest bed,
 Warm in his nurse's arms, fed to his fill
 With delicacies, and his heart at rest.
 But now, Astyanax (so named in Troy
 For thy sake, guardian of her gates and towers)
 His father lost, must many a pang endure.
 And as for thee, cast naked forth among
 Yon galleys, where no parent's eye of thine
 Shall find thee, when the dogs have torn thee once
 Till they are sated, worms shall eat thee next.
 Meantime, thy graceful raiment rich, prepared
 By our own maidens, in thy palace lies;
 But I will burn it, burn it all, because
 Useless to thee, who never, so adorn'd,
 Shalt slumber more; yet every eye in Troy
 Shall see, how glorious once was thy attire.[18]
 So, weeping, she; to whom the multitude
 Of Trojan dames responsive sigh'd around.
