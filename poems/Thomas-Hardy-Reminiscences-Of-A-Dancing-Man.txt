I

Who now remembers Almack's balls -
 Willis's sometime named -
In those two smooth-floored upper halls
 For faded ones so famed?
Where as we trod to trilling sound
The fancied phantoms stood around,
 Or joined us in the maze,
Of the powdered Dears from Georgian years,
Whose dust lay in sightless sealed-up biers,
 The fairest of former days.

II

Who now remembers gay Cremorne,
 And all its jaunty jills,
And those wild whirling figures born
 Of Jullien's grand quadrilles?
With hats on head and morning coats
There footed to his prancing notes
 Our partner-girls and we;
And the gas-jets winked, and the lustres clinked,
And the platform throbbed as with arms enlinked
 We moved to the minstrelsy.

III

Who now recalls those crowded rooms
 Of old yclept "The Argyle,"
Where to the deep Drum-polka's booms
 We hopped in standard style?
Whither have danced those damsels now!
Is Death the partner who doth moue
 Their wormy chaps and bare?
Do their spectres spin like sparks within
The smoky halls of the Prince of Sin
 To a thunderous Jullien air?
