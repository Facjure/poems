 Boy, not in these Autumnal bowers
 Shalt thou the Persian Vest dispose,
 Of artful fold, and rich brocade;
 Nor tie in gaudy knots the sprays and flowers.
 Ah! search not where the latest rose
 Yet lingers in the sunny glade;
 Plain be the vest, and simple be the braid!
 I charge thee with the myrtle wreath
 Not one resplendent bloom entwine;
 We both become that modest band,
 As stretch'd my vineyard's ample shade beneath,
 Jocund I quaff the rosy wine;
 While near me thou shalt smiling stand,
 And fill the sparkling cup with ready hand.
