Others may need new life in Heaven,
Man, Nature, Art, made new, assume!
Man with new mind old sense to leaven,
Nature, new light to clear old gloom,
Art that breaks bounds, gets soaring-room.

I shall pray: �Fugitive as precious,
Minutes which passed, return, remain!
Let earth�s old life once more enmesh us,
You with old pleasure, me, old, pain,
So we but meet nor part again!�
