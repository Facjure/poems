title: Keep Tryin'.

 When you're feelin' blue as ink
An' your spirits 'gin to sink,
 Don't be weak an' take a drink
But
 Keep Tryin'.

 There are times when all of us
Get riled up and start a muss,
 But there ain't no use to cuss,
Just
 Keep Tryin'.

 When things seem to go awry,
And the sun deserts your sky,
 Don't sit down somewhere and cry,
But
 Keep Tryin'.

 Everybody honors grit,
Men who never whine a bit--
 Men who tell the world, "I'm IT"
And
 Keep Tryin'.

 Get a hustle on you NOW,
Make a great, big solemn vow
 That you'll win out anyhow,
And
 Keep Tryin'.

 All the world's a battlefield
Where the true man is revealed,
 But the ones who never yield
 Keep Tryin'.
