 Dainty little Love came tripping
 Down the hill,
 Smiling as he thought of sipping
 Sweets at will.
SHE said, "No,
Love must go."
 Dainty little Love came tripping
 Down the hill.

 Dainty little Love went sighing
 Up the hill,
 All his little hopes were dying - 
 Love was ill.
Vain he tried
Tears to hide.
 Dainty little Love went sighing
 Up the hill.
