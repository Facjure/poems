 Thy glance is the brightest,
 Thy voice is the sweetest,
 Thy step is the lightest,
 Thy shape the completest:
 Thy waist I could span, dear,
 Thy neck's like a swan's, dear,
 And roses the sweetest
 On thy cheeks do appear.

 The music of Spring
 Is the voice of my charmer.
 When the nightingales sing
 She's as sweet; who would harm her?
 Where the snowdrop or lily lies
 They show her face, but her eyes
 Are the dark clouds, yet warmer,
 From which the quick lightning flies
 O'er the face of my charmer.

 Her faith is the snowdrop,
 So pure on its stem;
 And love in her bosom
 She wears as a gem;
 She is young as Spring flowers,
 And sweet as May showers,
 Swelling the clover buds, and bending the stem,
 She's the sweetest of blossoms, she love's favourite gem.
