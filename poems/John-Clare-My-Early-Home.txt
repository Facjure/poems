title: My Early Home
---

 Here sparrows build upon the trees,
 And stockdove hides her nest;
 The leaves are winnowed by the breeze
 Into a calmer rest;
 The black-cap's song was very sweet,
 That used the rose to kiss;
 It made the Paradise complete:
 My early home was this.

 The red-breast from the sweetbriar bush
 Drop't down to pick the worm;
 On the horse-chestnut sang the thrush,
 O'er the house where I was born;
 The moonlight, like a shower of pearls,
 Fell o'er this "bower of bliss,"
 And on the bench sat boys and girls:
 My early home was this.

 The old house stooped just like a cave,
 Thatched o'er with mosses green;
 Winter around the walls would rave,
 But all was calm within;
 The trees are here all green agen,
 Here bees the flowers still kiss,
 But flowers and trees seemed sweeter then:
 My early home was this.
