I here engage
Upon this page
A picture to portray,
Of two of an age
Yet neither a sage,
But right honest hearts have they.
Each loves to play
And have his own way,
Yet I'm happy to say
They quarrel, if ever, but seldom.
Though competent quite
To maintain their own right,
And even to fight,
Yet peace to their bosom is welcome.
Both go to school,
And learn by rule
That in neither a dunce we may find;
Both read and spell
And like it well;
Thus with pleasure is profit combined.
One's eyes are black,
The other's blue;
They both have honest hearts and true,
And love each other dearly:
One's father, is brother
To the other one's mother,
So cousins german are they most clearly;
Each has a father,
And each has a mother,
And both do dearly love him;
But neither a sister,
And neither a brother,
To play with, or to plague him.
And here I propose,
Ere I come to a close,
A little advice to give;
To which if they heed,
They'll be better indeed,
And happier as long as they live.
Be sure to mind
Your parents kind,
And do nothing to vex or tease them;
But through each day
Heed what they say,
And strive to obey and please them.
Take not in vain
God's holy name,
Do not work,
Do not play
On God's holy day,
Nor from church stay away;
Always bear it in mind
To be gentle and kind,
And friends you will find,
And hearts to you bind,
I am sure I may venture to say.
And when you're men,
Who sees you then
I hope in you models will see,
Of good and great,
In Church and State,
Whose lips with your lives agree.

Weston, Feb. 1852.
