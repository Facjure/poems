title: To One I Love.

Oh, let me plead with thee to have a nook,
 A garden nook, not far from thy domain,
That there, with harp, and voice, and poet-book,
 I may be true to thee, and, passion-fain,
 Rehearse the songs of nature once again: -
The songs of Cynthia wandering by the brook
 To soothe the raptures of a lover's pain,
And those of Phyllis with her shepherd's crook!
I die to serve thee, and for this alone, -
 To be thy bard-elect, from day to day, -
I would forego the right to fill a throne.
 I would consent to be the famine-prey
Of some fierce pard, if ere the night were flown
 I could subdue thy spirit to my sway.
