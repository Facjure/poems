I

 Winter without
And warmth within;
 The winds may shout
And the storm begin;
 The snows may pack
At the window pane,
 And the skies grow black,
And the sun remain
 Hidden away
The livelong day -
But here - in here is the warmth of May!

II

 Swoop your spitefullest
 Up the flue,
 Wild Winds - do!
What in the world do I care for you?
 O delightfullest
 Weather of all,
 Howl and squall,
And shake the trees till the last leaves fall!

III

 The joy one feels,
 In an easy chair,
 Cocking his heels
 In the dancing air
That wreathes the rim of a roaring stove
Whose heat loves better than hearts can love,
 Will not permit
 The coldest day
 To drive away
The fire in his blood, and the bliss of it!

IV

Then blow, Winds, blow!
 And rave and shriek,
And snarl and snow
 Till your breath grows weak -
While here in my room
 I'm as snugly shut
As a glad little worm
 In the heart of a nut!
