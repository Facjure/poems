title: A Lament
---

Over thy head, in joyful wanderings
 Through heaven's wide spaces, free,
Birds fly with music in their wings;
 And from the blue, rough sea
 The fishes flash and leap;
There is a life of loveliest things
 O'er thee, so fast asleep.

In the deep West the heavens grow heavenlier,
 Eve after eve; and still
The glorious stars remember to appear;
 The roses on the hill
 Are fragrant as before:
Only thy face, of all that's dear,
 I shall see nevermore!
