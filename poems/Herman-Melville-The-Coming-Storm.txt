 A Picture by S.R. Gifford, and owned by E.B.
 Included in the N.A. Exhibition, April, 1865.


 All feeling hearts must feel for him
 Who felt this picture. Presage dim - 
 Dim inklings from the shadowy sphere
 Fixed him and fascinated here.

 A demon-cloud like the mountain one
 Burst on a spirit as mild
 As this urned lake, the home of shades.
 But Shakspeare's pensive child

 Never the lines had lightly scanned,
 Steeped in fable, steeped in fate;
 The Hamlet in his heart was 'ware,
 Such hearts can antedate.

 No utter surprise can come to him
 Who reaches Shakspeare's core;
 That which we seek and shun is there - 
 Man's final lore.
