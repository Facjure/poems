title: On The Road To Gundagai
---

Oh, we started down from Roto when the sheds had all cut out.
We�d whips and whips of Rhino as we meant to push about,
So we humped our blues serenely and made for Sydney town,
With a three-spot cheque between us, as wanted knocking down.

 Chorus

But we camped at Lazy Harry�s, on the road to Gundagai
The road to Gundagai!Not five miles from Gundagai!
Yes, we camped at Lazy Harry�s, on the road to Gundagai.

Well, we struck the Murrumbidgee near the Yanko in a week,
And passed through old Narrandera and crossed the Burnet Creek.
And we never stopped at Wagga, for we�d Sydney in our eye.


But we camped at Lazy Harry�s, on the road to Gundagai.
Chorus: But we camped, &amp;c.

Oh, I�ve seen a lot of girls, my boys, and drunk a lot of beer,
And I�ve met with some of both, chaps, as has left me mighty queer;
But for beer to knock you sideways, and for girls to make you sigh,
You must camp at Lazy Harry�s, on the road to Gundagai.

Well, we chucked our blooming swags off, and we walked into the bar,
And we called for rum-an�-raspb�ry and a shilling each cigar.
But the girl that served the pizen, she winked at Bill and I�
And we camped at Lazy Harry�s,not five miles from Gundagai.

In a week the spree was over and the cheque was all knocked down,
So we shouldered our �Matildas,� and we turned our backs on town,
And the girls they stood a nobbler as we sadly said �Good bye,�
And we tramped from Lazy Harry�s, not five miles from Gundagai;

Chorus: And we tramped, &amp;c.
