 You, whose dull spirits feel not the fine glow
Enthusiasm breathes, no more of light
Perceive ye in rapt POESY, tho' bright
In Fancy's richest colouring, than can flow
 From jewel'd treasures in the central night
Of their deep caves. - You have no Sun to show
Their inborn radiance pure. - Go, Snarlers, go;
Nor your defects of feeling, and of sight,
 To charge upon the POET thus presume,
Ye lightless minds, whate'er of title proud,
Scholar, or Sage, or Critic, ye assume,
 Arraigning his high claims with censure loud,
Or sickly scorn; yours, yours is all the cloud,
Gems cannot sparkle in the midnight Gloom.
