[W.S.]


 With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho rhyme!
 O the shepherd lad
 He is ne'er so glad
 As when he pipes, in the blossom-time,
 So rare!
 While Kate picks by, yet looks not there.
 So rare! so rare!
 With a hey! and a hi! and a ho!
 The grasses curdle where the daisies blow!

 With a hey! and a hi! and a hey-ho vow!
 Then he sips her face
 At the sweetest place - 
 And ho! how white is the hawthorn now! - 
 So rare! - 
 And the daisied world rocks round them there.
 So rare! so rare!
 With a hey! and a hi! and a ho!
 The grasses curdle where the daisies blow!
