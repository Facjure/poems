title: A Song Of Republics
---

Fair Freedom's ship, too long adrift -
 Of every wind the sport -
Now rigged and manned, her course well planned,
 Sails proudly out of port;
And fluttering gaily from the mast
 This motto is unfurled,
Let all men heed its truth who read:
 "Republics rule the World!"

The universe is high as God!
 Good is the final goal;
The world revolves and man evolves
 A purpose and a soul.
No church can bind, no crown forbid
 Thought's mighty upward course -
Let kings give way before its sway,
 For God inspires its force.

The hero of a vanished age
 Was one who bathed in gore;
Who best could fight was noblest knight
 In savage days of yore;
Now warrior chiefs are out of date,
 The times have changed.To-day
We call men great who arbitrate
 And keep war's hounds at bay.

The world no longer looks to priest
 Or prince to know its needs;
Earth's human throng has grown too strong
 To rule with courts and creeds.
We want no kings but kings of toil -
 No crowns but crowns of deeds;
Not royal birth but sterling worth
 Must mark the man who leads.

Proud monarchies are out of step
 With modern thought to-day,
For Brotherhood is understood,
 And thrones may pass away.
Men dare to think.Concerted thought
 Contains more power than swords:
The force that binds united minds
 Defeats mere savage hordes.

Man needs no arbitrary hand
 To keep him in control;
He feels the power grow hour by hour
 Of his expanding soul:
In God's stupendous scheme of worlds
 He knows he has a place;
He is no slave to cringe, and crave
 Some worthless monarch's grace.

As ocean billows undermine
 The haughty shores each hour,
Time's sea has brought its waves of thought
 To crumble thrones of power;
And one by one shall kingdoms fall
 Like leaves before the blast,
As man with man combines to plan
 Republics formed to last.

Columbia baulked a tyrant king,
 And built upon a rock,
In Freedom's name, a shrine whose fame
 Outlived the century's shock.
Now France within our port has set
 Her symbol of re-birth;
Her lifted hand tells sea and land
 Republics light the earth.

One mighty church for all the world
 Would make men far more kind;
One government would bring content
 To many a restless mind.
Sail on, fair ship of Freedom, sail
 The wide sea's breadth and length.
'Till worlds unite to make the might
 Of "One Republic's" strength.
