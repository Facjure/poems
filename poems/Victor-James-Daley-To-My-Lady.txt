title: To My Lady

When the tender hand of Night
Like a rose-leaf falls
Softly on your starry eyes;
When the Sleep-God calls,
And the gate of dreams is wide,
Wide the painted halls,
Dream the dream I send to you
Through your spiritï¿½s walls!

Dream a lowly lover came,
Lady fair to woo;
Dream that I the lover was,
And the lady, you;
Dream your answer was a kiss,
Warm as summer dew,
Waking, in the rosy dawn,
Let the dream be true!
