title: Lines On The Death Of Sir William Russel.
---

Doom�d, as I am, in solitude to waste
The present moments, and regret the past;
Deprived of every joy I valued most,
My friend torn from me, and my mistress lost;
Call not this gloom I wear, this anxious mien,
The dull effect of humour, or of spleen!
Still, still I mourn, with each returning day,
Him[1] snatch�d by fate in early youth away;
And her�thro� tedious years of doubt and pain,
Fix�d in her choice, and faithful�but in vain!
O prone to pity, generous, and sincere,
Whose eye ne�er yet refused the wretch a tear;
Whose heart the real claim of friendship knows;
Nor thinks a lover�s are but fancied woes;
See me�ere yet my destined course half done,
Cast forth a wand�rer on a world unknown!
See me neglected on the world�s rude coast,
Each dear companion of my voyage lost!
Nor ask why clouds of sorrow shade my brow,
And ready tears wait only leave to flow!
Why all that soothes a heart from anguish free,
All that delights the happy�palls with me!
