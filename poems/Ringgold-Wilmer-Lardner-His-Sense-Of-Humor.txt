title: His Sense Of Humor

Perhaps in some respects it's true
 That you resemble dad;
To be informed I look like you
 Would never make me mad.
But one thing I am sure of, son,
 You have a different line
Of humor, your idea of fun
 Is not a bit like mine.

You drop my slippers in the sink
 And leave them there to soak.
That's very laughable, you think
 But I can't see the joke
You take my hat outdoors with you
 And fill it full of earth;
You seem to think that's witty, too,
 But I'm not moved to mirth.

You open up the chicken-yard;
 Its inmates run a mile;
You giggle, but I find it hard
 To force one-half a smile.
No, kid, I fear your funny stuff,
 Though funny it may be,
Is not quite delicate enough
 To make a hit with me.
