(Two who became a story)



 By the Runic Stone
 They sat, where the grass sloped down,
And chattered, he white-hatted, she in brown,
 Pink-faced, breeze-blown.

 Rapt there alone
 In the transport of talking so
In such a place, there was nothing to let them know
 What hours had flown.

 And the die thrown
 By them heedlessly there, the dent
It was to cut in their encompassment,
 Were, too, unknown.

 It might have strown
 Their zest with qualms to see,
As in a glass, Time toss their history
 From zone to zone!
