 When first I looked upon the face of Pain
 I shrank repelled, as one shrinks from a foe
 Who stands with dagger poised, as for a blow.
 I was in search of Pleasure and of Gain;
 I turned aside to let him pass: in vain;
 He looked straight in my eyes and would not go.
 "Shake hands," he said; "our paths are one, and so
 We must be comrades on the way, 'tis plain."

 I felt the firm clasp of his hand on mine;
 Through all my veins it sent a strengthening glow.
 I straightway linked my arm in his, and lo!
 He led me forth to joys almost divine;
 With God's great truths enriched me in the end:
 And now I hold him as my dearest friend.
