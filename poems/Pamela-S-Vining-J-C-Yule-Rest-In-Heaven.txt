title: Rest In Heaven
---

When tossed on time's tempestuous tide,
By angry storms resistless driven,
One hope can bid our fears subside - 
It is the hope of rest in Heaven.

With trusting heart we lift our eyes
Above the dark clouds, tempest-driven,
And view, beyond those troubled skies,
The peaceful, stormless rest of Heaven.

No more to shed the exile's tears, - 
No more the heart by anguish riven, - 
No longer bent 'neath toilful years, - 
How sweet will be the rest of Heaven
