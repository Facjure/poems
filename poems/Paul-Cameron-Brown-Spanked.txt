Buying up egg rolls at 50ï¿½ a kick,
they royally entered our bloodstream
 - a riot of sensation
akin to dynamite caps
kicked off in the brain.

Later, sitting in the booth
a chocolate brown wall
to aid the digestion;
a frumpy waitress
plunks water down
to complete the feast.

Taken back, the surcharge
at such festivities exorbitant,
we squander in exact change
the full price to do it again.
