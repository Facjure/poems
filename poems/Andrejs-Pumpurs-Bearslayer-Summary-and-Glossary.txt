title: Bearslayer - Summary and Glossary
---

	It is the turn of the 13th century, 800 years ago in Latvia. The
	Baltic gods have gathered to consult the Father of Destiny about
	their own fate and that of the Latvian people. Both are under threat
	from invading German knights, who have been sent by the Pope to
	christianize the Baltic region, under the command of Bishop
	Albert. Perkons, the God of Thunder, calls on all the gods to guard
	and nurture the Latvians, and they promise to do so, each in his or
	her own way.

	As the council is breaking up the Goddess Staburadze reveals that
	she has rescued a young man from the River Daugava, where he was
	cast down by two witches. She has taken him to her Crystal Palace
	beneath the river in the whirlpool of Staburags, from which no human
	can emerge alive. Perkons reveals that this youth is Bearslayer, who
	will become a noble warrior under the protection of Perkons, and
	will strive mightily against the forces of evil.

	At the beginning of Canto II the action goes back in time to the
	Castle of Lielvarde, shortly before the Council of the Gods
	described in the previous canto. The son of the Lord of Lielvarde
	reveals mighty strength, killing a bear with his bare hands. This
	first heroic deed wins him the name "Bearslayer." (This young man is
	the hero that Perkons revealed to the other gods in Canto I.) The
	youth is not the true son of the Lord of Lielvarde, but a foundling
	suckled by a female bear in the forest. (Although it is not directly
	explained until almost the end of the poem, it is important to know
	that Bearslayer has bear's ears, and that if these are cut off he
	will lose his bearlike strength.) Bearslayer was brought to
	Lielvarde as a baby by Vaidelots, a Messenger of the Gods, to be
	raised until he reached manhood. After killing the bear he is sent
	to study for seven years in the Castle of Burtnieks, in order to
	learn the ancient wisdom of the Latvian race.Accompanied by the
	good advice of his foster father, he sets off.

	On the way to Burtnieks's Castle, Bearslayer visits the castle of
	the Latvian Lord Aizkrauklis, where he is stunned by the beauty of
	Aizkrauklis's daughter, Spidala. However, he watches her and
	discovers that she is a witch. He follows her by hiding in a hollow
	log on which she flies to the Devil's Pit, and witnesses evil rites,
	as well as seeing the false holy man, Kangars, promise to serve the
	Devil by working against the ancient gods and supporting
	Christianity, because Christians are easier prey for the Devil. On
	the journey back to Aizkraukle Bearslayer is cast down into the
	whirlpool of Staburags in the River Daugava by Spidala and another
	witch. From here he is rescued by Staburadze, as we already know
	from Canto I, and taken to her Crystal Palace beneath the whirlpool.

	With the help of the beautiful and virtuous maiden, Laimdota,
	Staburadze nurses Bearslayer back to health. She reveals to him that
	he has been chosen by the gods to fight against evil, especially
	Spidala and Kangars, who are plotting in secret. Staburadze gives
	him a talisman, a magic mirror, and Laimdota gives him a ribbon
	decorated with an oak-leaf pattern. He leaves the Crystal Palace and
	is duly turned to stone, as are all mortals, but is restored to life
	by Perkons. He performs a second heroic deed, saving a boat that is
	sinking in the raging River Perse by rowing with his bare hands, and
	is befriended by a powerful youth, Koknesis. Together they ride to
	Burtnieks, accompanied by the curses of Spidala.

	Canto III opens with Spidala hurrying to the hut of Kangars to warn
	him that Bearslayer was present in the Devil's Pit and saw the
	shameful deeds. To prevent Bearslayer revealing that he and Spidala
	are in league with the Devil, Kangars decides to lure the young hero
	into a trap by provoking a war against the Estonian Giant,
	Kalapuisis, certain that Bearslayer will rush into battle against
	the invincible foeman and be killed. As Kangars explains this plot
	to Spidala a terrible storm arises, and Spidala is unable to return
	home.

	The storm was sent by Perkons to destroy a ship just arriving at the
	mouth of the River Daugava from Germany, in order to kill the German
	missionaries it is carrying. Led by the priest, Dietrich, they have
	come with the intention of forcing the Baltic people to accept
	Christianity. However, the Livian fisher-folk of the Daugava estuary
	rescue the passengers from the ship. Thus, they thwart the will of
	Perkons, who had planned to drown the newcomers, and save the very
	people who will eventually become their conquerors. The morning
	after the storm, a fisherman brings Dietrich to Kangars, and an
	alliance is forged, since both want to introduce Christianity,
	although for differing reasons.

	Years pass. Bearslayer and Koknesis study hard in the Castle of
	Burtnieks. Bearslayer has a special reason to seek perfection:
	Laimdota is the daughter of Burtnieks and has returned home to the
	castle from Staburadze's Crystal Palace, where she and Bearslayer
	met. They fall in love, but just as Bearslayer is about to ask for
	her hand news arrives that Kalapuisis has entered Latvia and is
	killing and laying waste.Burtnieks offers Laimdota's hand to any
	warrior who can rid them of Kalapuisis, and Bearslayer rides out to
	face him: The plot seems to be succeeding!

	Bearslayer faces Kalapuisis in single combat, and defeats
	him. However, just as Bearslayer is about to kill him, Kalapuisis
	reveals a prophecy told him by his mother that a bear cub from the
	Daugava, who is of noble rank and equal to Kalapuisis as a warrior,
	will come and save the Latvians from their conquerors. The two
	warriors realize that Bearslayer is this bear cub, and that they
	have a common enemy-the Germans-and make peace, so that they can
	work together against the invaders.

	Successful in the Estonian war, Bearslayer returns to Burtnieks's
	Castle with the other Latvian warriors, and they are greeted in song
	by the local maidens. Laimdota places an oak-leaf wreath on
	Bearslayer's head and sings of his might, promising to make him a
	true and virtuous wife.Bearslayer replies in song that he will
	live and die for Laimdota. Amid great joy and feelings of
	brotherhood the warriors toast Bearslayer, and conclude that the
	gods personally intervened on his behalf. This divine intervention
	gives Bearslayer legendary status so that, instead of destroying
	him, the plot added to his fame.

	Once again, time passes while Bearslayer studies at the Castle of
	Burtnieks. One night he notices in the fortress's undercroft a
	trapdoor, left half-open to reveal a stone staircase leading
	below. He goes down and follows a tunnel until he enters a large
	chamber that he judges to be beneath the centre of the lake. He is
	in the Sunken Castle that Laimdota had told him about.He discovers
	Laimdota reading an ancient book.She explains to him that if a
	mortal remains in the Sunken Castle overnight and survives until
	morning, the castle will rise once more into the light of
	day. Bearslayer resolves to carry out this heroic task and Laimdota
	leaves him.

	Midnight passes and the Sunken Castle grows cold. Bearslayer lights
	a fire from broken wood lying around. Suddenly seven evil spirits
	enter the room carrying an open coffin, in which an old man with
	huge sharp teeth and long nails is lying. He begins to groan
	horribly and complain that he is cold. Bearslayer cannot bear the
	sound and hauls the man from the coffin to the fire, but the old man
	tries to bite off Bearslayer's ears, knowing that without them
	Bearslayer is weak.Bearslayer fights back and holds the old man in
	the fire, saying that he will only let him go if the Sunken Castle
	is raised to the surface.

	At this, a whirlwind springs up and the seven evil spirits return,
	led by Spidala. They attack Bearslayer and he is about to be
	defeated when he remembers the mirror that Staburadze gave him. He
	pulls it out and holds it in Spidala's face. A howling fills the air
	and all the evil spirits turn to dust and are whirled round the room
	in the whirlwind.The spirit of Viduveds, a wise man of ancient
	times, appears in human form and greets Bearslayer, saying that the
	young hero will save the Latvian people. Viduveds's handmaidens make
	a bed for Bearslayer, and he falls into a deep sleep.

	Next morning the people are amazed to see a castle standing on an
	island in the middle of the lake. Laimdota tells Burtnieks that
	Bearslayer has spent the night in the castle, and the old man
	realizes at once that Bearslayer has broken the magic spell and
	saved the Sunken Castle. Laimdota and Burtnieks enter the castle and
	wake Bearslayer. He claims Laimdota as his bride, and Burtnieks
	gives his blessing, saying that the union of the two clans
	(Burtnieks and Lielvarde) will save the Latvians.

	One evening, later, Laimdota reads to Bearslayer from the ancient
	books found in the Sunken Castle. She reads how the ancient Latvians
	were led to the Baltic Sea from a land far to the east by
	Perkons. With the favour of the gods, they settled in a valley,
	built a castle, and established a golden age on Earth.

	However, this made the Devil jealous, and he commanded a whirlwind
	to suck up a lake and deposit it in the valley.This was done and
	the valley, including the castle, was drowned. The people would have
	died too, but Liga, the Goddess of Song, saved them by using the
	music of her kokle to open up under the lake a tunnel that led them
	to safety.The castle is the one Bearslayer raised, and the tunnel
	the one he used to enter the castle.

	On another occasion, Laimdota reads to Bearslayer the story of the
	creation. In eternal space there was once nothing except a celestial
	light. In it lived God and a second mighty spirit-the Devil. At that
	time the Devil still obeyed God, although he was already growing
	rebellious. God decided to create the Earth and sent the Devil to
	fetch a handful of slime. The Devil was curious and kept a second
	handful for himself, hiding it in his mouth. When he brought the
	slime to God, God commanded the slime to form the Earth, throwing it
	down.The slime began to grow, and formed the level plains of the
	Earth. However, the slime in the Devil's mouth also obeyed God and
	grew until the Devil could no longer hold it in his mouth. He spat
	it out and it fell to the newly created Earth, forming the
	mountains.

	From His own substance God created the Sun and Moon. He was so
	pleased with the Earth and Sun He had just created that He also
	created the first living creatures: the Sons of the Gods and the
	Daughters of the Sun. The Moon took a gigantic Daughter of the Sun
	as his wife, and the stars are their thousands of children. The Sons
	of the Gods divided up the Earth among themselves.

	The Devil grew more rebellious and began to defy God. A great
	rivalry grew up between them, and the Devil tried in vain to outdo
	God, who, however, always had the upper hand. Eventually, God
	created humans and made them capable only of good, but the Devil
	interfered and gave them the power to be evil as well as good. God
	grew furiously angry at seeing His creation ruined, and banished the
	Devil to Hell. There the Devil created evil demons and with them
	rose up from Hell and fought against God and all good
	spirits. Eventually, the Devil was defeated and driven back to Hell,
	after Perkons intervened in the fight

	Later Laimdota reads from the teachings of the guardian of the
	Latvian race, in which he listed the tasks of worthy human beings:
	to seek perfection of the human race, to fight against evil by
	obeying the ancient teachings, to make just laws and drive out bad
	rulers, and to love nature.

	All Souls' Eve comes. The people of Burtnieks's Castle celebrate
	this in the traditional Latvian way. Next morning, however, Laimdota
	and Koknesis have vanished, and Bearslayer sets off to find them,
	vowing never to return unless he is successful.Meanwhile, a German
	ship has arrived at the mouth of the Daugava, and Dietrich and
	Kangars persuade the the local Latvian Lord, Kaupa, to return in it
	to Rome with Dietrich.Kangars stays behind, but knows that the
	Germans' friendship is only a trick to gain control of Latvia.

	The ship sails. Just then Bearslayer rides up. He knows full well
	that Kangars and Spidala have kidnapped Laimdota, and demands that
	they give her back. Spidala tells him that she is on the ship just
	vanishing over the horizon. Kangars says that she and Koknesis are
	lovers. Bearslayer does not believe this lie, although he
	experiences some doubts, and rides off in deep despair. Spidala
	gloats over his sorrow. She has her revenge, and Bearslayer's life
	is worse than death.

	Bearslayer returns to Lielvarde, his home. He is greeted warmly, but
	his father sees that something is wrong. Bearslayer tells him all,
	and his father consoles him with wise words of hope: Perhaps
	Laimdota loves him still and will yet be saved. Bearslayer spends
	his days roaming the cliffs above the Daugava brooding, and longing
	to go with the waters down to the sea to fight against the North
	Wind and meet the North Wind's Daughter. One day he vanishes, and
	no-one knows where he has gone.

	Canto IV opens with Kaupa in Rome. He is seduced by the wealth and
	power he sees, doubts the old gods, and decides to embrace
	Christianity and convert the Latvians. Back in Latvia, the people
	labour long building a walled city for the Germans, who are now
	present in large numbers-Riga. Once they have their fortress the
	Germans begin to plunder everything they can get their hands on, to
	pillage and to destroy. Full of bitterness, the Latvians realize
	that they have been tricked.

	Meanwhile, in Germany Laimdota is being held captive in a convent.
	Spidala had tricked her into leaving her father's castle back in
	Latvia by pretending to be her mother. Laimdota was then seized by
	Spidala's minions, brought to Riga, and placed on the ship to
	Germany as a prisoner. During the journey Dietrich tries to calm her
	and tells her that she will soon be the Bride of Christ. Laimdota
	replies that she loves Bearslayer, will not be forced to become
	anyone else's bride and is, in any case, a mortal and not fit to
	become the bride of Christ. Although hardened and without pangs of
	conscience, Dietrich blushes at her virtuous answer, and leaves
	her. Kaupa refuses to help her on the grounds that it is the will of
	Destiny that she go to Germany. Soon both Dietrich and Kaupa forget
	about her.

	The convent prioress tries to persuade Laimdota to accept
	Christianity and threatens to allow her to be seized by a local
	count and used as a concubine. To escape this fate Laimdota pretends
	to accept Christianity but, despite this, one night armed men break
	into the convent and seize her. As they are about to carry her off
	an unknown warrior appears and fights all the kidnappers on his
	own. He kills all except one, and rescues Laimdota. She recognizes
	him as Koknesis and they flee into the mountains. Along the way
	Koknesis explains how he too was tricked into going on the ship to
	Germany. Once in Germany, he heard that a Baltic woman was being
	held in the convent and decided to rescue her, without knowing that
	it was Laimdota.

	The action turns to the Northern Sea, where Bearslayer is wandering
	in a ship, lost on the way to Germany to seek Laimdota. The North
	Wind's Daughter hears the sailors calling upon her in song, and she
	comes to them in her own ship. She says that it would be best if
	they came to her island to rest, before continuing their journey,
	and Bearslayer agrees. They avoid the Castle of the North Wind,
	where he is sleeping, perhaps for another month. Once he is awake,
	the winter will set in and they will not be able to escape because
	of the ice and storms.

	The island is warmed by fires from the centre of the Earth, and the
	sailors enjoy a pleasant stay. Eventually the North Wind's Daughter
	tells them that her father is about to wake up and that they must
	leave. She warns them not to return by the route that they came by,
	because Bearslayer's enemies now know that he is using that route
	and may be too strong for him. She describes an alternative route,
	but warns of its great dangers, including the land of the dog-snout
	ogres, the Kingdom of Dreams, the Hill of Diamonds, and the
	Enchanted Isle. The sailors set off in the nick of time: The North
	Wind has woken up and they are involved in a fearsome storm, from
	which they barely escape.

	They reach the island of the Dog-Snout Ogres, where they tie up.
	Bearslayer goes ashore with a party of men to cut up and share the
	meat of some deer he has already killed. They are at work when
	suddenly the Dog-Snouts pour out of a cave and attack them. They
	tear the men apart with their teeth and even Bearslayer is scarcely
	able to save himself.He is wounded and seems doomed, until he
	notices that no more Dog-Snouts are coming out of their cave. He
	slips in to the cave and is able to defend himself with his spear in
	its narrow opening. The Dog-Snouts then bring up large boulders and
	block the entrance, trapping Bearslayer inside.

	Back at the ship the sailors wait in vain for their comrades. Their
	orders forbid them to go ashore and search for them. At the last
	moment Bearslayer appears and tells them to disembark at once. They
	do so, and escape the Land of the Dog-Snouts. At sea Bearslayer
	explains what happened. He got out of the cave by digging a hole at
	the rear with his spear. This took several days, but he found some
	raw meat in the cave, and lived on that. The Dog-Snouts were busy
	watching the front of the cave, and thus did not see Bearslayer as
	he escaped at the rear.

	They sail away, and reach the Kingdom of Dreams. This is where
	Heaven and Earth come together, the gates of Paradise standing
	alongside the entrance to Hell. This land is the location of the
	Gardens of the Sun, where the Sun returns at dusk and rests at night
	before setting off each morning. Under the protection of the Sons of
	the Gods and the Daughters of the Sun they stay in the pleasant
	Kingdom of Dreams for some time, but eventually set off again.

	They travel in pitch darkness at first, but later see a tiny glint
	of light, towards which they sail. They come closer and sight the
	Hill of Diamonds, its peak glowing brilliantly. The ship docks and
	the sailors rush on shore. Despite Bearslayer's warning, a sailor
	climbs to the peak and vanishes. A second does the same. A third
	ties himself to a rope and is pulled back by his comrades as he is
	vanishing. He is saved, but never speaks again.

	They sail away and encounter fair winds and weather. Fog obscures
	the course and they suddenly emerge close to a beautiful
	island. Bearslayer realizes that this is the Enchanted Isle the
	North Wind's Daughter warned against, from which no ship can
	escape. They try to sail away but are drawn to the island until the
	ship runs up on its shore.

	Canto V continues on the Enchanted Isle. There is no sign of life,
	except for a track leading from the forest to a bridge and, at the
	seaward end of the bridge, a beautiful palace. Inside is a sumptuous
	meal, and in a second room soft beds for all. The sailors fall upon
	the food and then all go to bed. Bearslayer arms himself and stands
	guard at the end of the bridge.

	At midnight a rider comes out of the forest. It is the Three-Headed
	Demon. He speaks aloud, revealing that he hates Bearslayer, but
	believes that his enemy is far away, trapped on the Northern Sea. At
	this Bearslayer roars that he is there. The demon challenges
	Bearslayer to fight and show his strength. They ride into the thick
	forest where the demon blows down the trees, so that they will have
	a clearing in which to fight: One breath clears an area three miles
	across! They fight and the demon's blows drive Bearslayer into the
	ground up to his knees.None the less, Bearslayer prevails. He then
	returns to the palace at the bridge and lies down to sleep.Nothing
	further disturbs their rest that night.

	The next night Bearslayer again stands guard.Again, at midnight a
	rider comes out of the forest. This time it is the Six-Headed Demon,
	who also hates Bearslayer and believes that he is lost on the
	Northern Sea. Again Bearslayer challenges the demon, who clears the
	forest by blowing down trees, this time six miles around.They
	fight and Bearslayer is driven into the ground to his hips, but
	still wins with some difficulty.

	The third night, before going on guard, Bearslayer tells the others
	that he may need their help. He places Staburadze's mirror on a
	table alongside a bowl of water, and tells them that if, during the
	night, the water turns to blood, they must bring the mirror to his
	aid. At midnight the Nine-Headed Demon appears at the
	bridge. Bearslayer and the demon fight in a clearing nine miles
	across, and Bearslayer is driven into the ground to his armpits. He
	looks in vain for help from his shipmates, and is about to be
	defeated. Desperate, he throws his club three miles through the
	window of the palace where the others are sleeping. This wakes them,
	they see that the water has turned to blood, and they hasten to
	bring Bearslayer the mirror. In the nick of time he shows the demon
	the mirror, and it falls down frozen. Bearslayer climbs out of the
	ground and kills it.

	To be sure that the island is safe they search it, and discover a
	beautiful valley in which is a well of clear water, alongside it a
	leafy apple tree with magnificent fruit. The men want to drink, but
	first Bearslayer thrusts his sword into the water, marking a
	triangle.There are screams and the water turns to blood, but soon
	clears and they drink in safety. After this, the men want to eat
	apples, but Bearslayer grows angry, saying that they are not there
	to pick fruit.He threatens to cut down the tree with his sword,
	but suddenly a voice from the tree begs for mercy.Bearslayer steps
	back in surprise and the tree turns into a beautiful young woman. To
	Bearslayer's horror, it is Spidala.

	Spidala throws herself at his feet and begs for mercy. She swears to
	make good all her wicked deeds, and never to do evil again.
	Bearslayer grants her her life - he fights demons and giants, not
	women!Spidala tells him that Laimdota and Koknesis are loyal and
	pure, and reveals how she and Kangars tricked them into going to
	Germany. She also reveals how the Old Witch cast a spell on the
	island to draw in ships. Once trapped on the island's shore the
	ships' crews sink into a deep sleep. This is the spell that drew
	Bearslayer's ship to the island, where the witch intended to trap
	him. The three demons were her sons. On hearing of their death the
	Old Witch set a trap by changing herself into the well and Spidala
	into the apple tree.However, when Bearslayer plunged his sword
	into the well he killed the witch, and thus broke the spell on
	Spidala.

	Spidala reminds Bearslayer that it is his duty to return to Latvia
	and drive out the marauding Germans. She yearns to help, but is
	trapped in a pact with the Devil. Bearslayer realizes that she is
	truly repentant and wants to help her. Suddenly he remembers the
	little package that he brought with him as a souvenir of the Devil's
	Pit, and orders some sailors to fetch it and give it to her. When
	Spidala sees it she is overjoyed: It is her contract with the Devil,
	and she is now free! They go to the beach, where Spidala releases
	the ships and sailors trapped on the shore. Suddenly, among the
	people released, Bearslayer sees Koknesis and Laimdota!

	Koknesis and Laimdota tell the story of their escape from
	Germany. They too were drawn on shore on the Enchanted Isle by the
	Old Witch, and put into a long sleep. Spidala hangs back, but
	Bearslayer tells the others that it was she who broke the spell on
	them: They thank her, and the four swear eternal friendship.
	Spidala shows them around the island, which she knows well, and some
	of the awakened people decide to live there for good. Eventually,
	however Bearslayer, Koknesis, Laimdota and Spidala decide to leave.

	The evening before they depart, Koknesis wanders back to the well in
	the valley. He sees Spidala burn her pact with the Devil.She asks
	him to keep this a secret.He agrees, but in turn tells her his
	secret: He loves her and wants her to marry him. She eventually
	agrees. The four set off back to Latvia on Bearslayer's ship, and on
	the way Koknesis and Spidala tell Bearslayer and Laimdota about
	their love. These two are overjoyed. After a long journey they sight
	Latvian shores, and eventually sail into the mouth of the Daugava.

	Canto VI opens with Midsummer's Eve in Latvia. The people are called
	together by the Midsummer Priests. They bring offerings for the gods
	and gifts for each other, and gather around fires on the Azure
	Mountain. They pray for blessings for the coming year, and pay
	respect to the spirits of their ancestors. The oldest priest calls
	on them to live together in harmony, and many grudges are settled
	with a handshake. The young men and women begin to dance together.

	While the young people celebrate, the Clan Chieftains meet in
	council on the Azure Mountain. They are concerned because the
	prophetic writings kept in the Sacred Grove on the mountainside
	predict calamity.Lielvardis arrives and reveals that the German
	knights have captured a number of Latvian stockades and built their
	own stone castles, and are imposing Christianity at the point of the
	sword. His own fortress, Lielvarde, has been seized. Bishop Albert
	is bringing more knights from Germany to take over all Latvia. At
	this moment Bearslayer appears, together with Koknesis, Laimdota and
	Spidala. Bearslayer is elected leader of the Latvian warriors. All
	pledge themselves to fight to free their land, and return to their
	homes to prepare for war.

	Bearslayer and Laimdota, as well as Koknesis and Spidala, are
	married at the Castle of Burtnieks, Laimdota's home. There is a
	great wedding celebration, but this is cut short by Burtnieks, who
	tells them that they will soon be at war. The new couples have
	little time for wedded bliss before the men have to set off to fight
	the German invaders, and Laimdota and Spidala, refusing to be
	separated so soon from their new hus- bands, set off with them.The
	Latvian host gathers and marches on Turaida. On the way, they
	eliminate German infestation whenever they encounter it.

	Alarmed by the Latvian uprising, many Germans have fled to Turaida
	and taken refuge in the stone castle built there by the Germans. The
	Latvians lay siege to the castle, and eventually are able to scale
	the walls at night and fight on the ramparts. A fearful battle
	ensues, with heavy losses on both sides. Bearslayer kills many
	Germans and, realizing that he is too strong for them, the Germans
	surrender. Among those captured is Dietrich, who is handed over to
	the locals for punishment. However, he tricks them into setting him
	free.They now march on Lielvarde, Bearslayer's home, where the
	German knight, Daniel, has built a stone castle. Just before they
	arrive, Daniel invites the chieftains of some Latvian clans that had
	fled into the forest to a parley. However, once he has them in a
	great pavilion he locks them in and sets fire to it. The elders cry
	for help as Daniel and his men watch in glee from the castle walls.


	In the nick of time Bearslayer arrives with his army. He rescues the
	chieftains and attacks the German castle. The Germans fight hard but
	are defeated, and all except Daniel are slaughtered. He is handed to
	the local people for punishment, and they throw him into the Daugava
	tied to a plank. Bearslayer re-establishes himself at Lielvarde

	Meanwhile, Albert has returned to Germany to recruit more
	knights. He leaves Kaupa in charge in Riga, to where most Germans
	have now retreated. All seems well for the Latvians, and Bearslayer
	and Laimdota settle down to married life together. The others too
	return to their homes, thinking to live out their lives in peace.

	Springtime comes, and the Latvians have little thought of war. Even
	Kangars is working in his garden. His life is bitter: He receives no
	honour from any one, any more.He knows that death will bring him
	the torments of Hell, while his remaining days of life are wracked
	with the knowledge of his own wickedness. One day Dietrich comes to
	him and asks him to communicate with evil spirits to discover the
	source of Bearslayer's strength. Kangars says that it is no concern
	of his that Bearslayer is killing Germans, but that he has his own
	reasons for wanting to destroy the young man. He wrestles with
	demons for three days and nights without sleep, and they reveal to
	him the secret of Bearslayer's strength-his bear's ears.

	Among the new knights brought back from Germany by Albert is the
	Black Knight. He is already experienced in doing wicked deeds in
	Germany. He claims to be the son of a witch and immune to harm from
	wounds. One day Kaupa takes a party of knights, including the Black
	Knight, to Lielvarde, and asks for admission, saying that he wishes
	to make peace between the Latvians and Albert. Bearslayer wants
	peace and the Germans are admitted. They are treated well, and
	Bearslayer organizes a tournament to entertain them.

	In the tournament, both Bearslayer and the Black Knight defeat their
	opponents, and the Black Knight suggests that they fight each other.
	Bearslayer refuses, although he does not want to insult the Black
	Knight. The Black Knight then says that it would hardly be a test of
	his strength to fight Bearslayer, any way, despite all Bearslayer's
	boasting. Stung by this, Bearslayer seizes his sword and the two
	fight.

	At first Bearslayer thinks that it is mere sport, but the Black
	Knight fights with great vigour, and suddenly cuts off one of
	Bearslayer's ears. Enraged, Bearslayer now attacks in earnest, and
	with a terrible blow of his sword splits open the Black Knight's
	armour and wounds him. However, his sword breaks. Seeing this, the
	Black Knight attacks again, and cuts off Bearslayer's other ear.

	Terribly angry, Bearslayer seizes the Black Knight and they wrestle
	together. In their fight they stumble to the very edge of the high
	cliffs above the River Daugava. Bearslayer's men look on, grown pale
	with apprehension and rooted to the spot with fear. Three times
	Bearslayer lifts up the Black Knight, but each time the German kicks
	free. Finally, Bearslayer throws him over the cliff into the river's
	depths, but the Black Knight drags Bearslayer with him. Weighed down
	by the knight's heavy armour, they sink to the bottom. At this
	moment the waves roar and an island rises up in the river.In the
	castle, Laimdota, who had had a premonition of disaster, shrieks and
	ends her own life.

	Soon, the Latvian heroes are defeated one by one by the Germans, for
	whom they are no match without Bearslayer. The Germans establish
	themselves as harsh masters, and the Latvian people are plunged into
	centuries of slavery. However, for them Bearslayer is not dead, but
	sleeps beneath the island in a golden bed.

	Even today, sometimes at midnight boatmen on the Daugava see two
	shadowy figures locked in struggle on the cliffs above the river,
	while in the ruins of the old castle of Lielvarde a little flame
	burns. The figures struggling on the cliff top are Bearslayer and
	the Black Knight, and the flame in the castle is Laimdota.Each
	time they fight the two warriors plunge together into the
	river. There is a terrible scream in the castle, and the flame goes
	out.

	However, the day will come when Bearslayer will defeat the Black
	Knight and cast him down alone into the river to drown. On that day,
	the Latvians will be free!
