Sweet April! from out of the hidden place
 Where you keep your green and gold,
We pray thee to bring us a gift of grace,
 When the little leaves unfold.

Oh! make us glad with the things that are young;
 Give our hearts the quickened thrills
That used to answer each robin that sung
 In the days of daffodils.

For what is the worth of all that we gain,
 If we lose the old delight,
That came in the time of sun and rain,
 When the whole round world seemed right?

It was then we gave, as we went along,
 The faith that to-day we keep;
And those April days were for mirth and song,
 While the nights were made for sleep.

Yet, though we follow with steps that are slow
 The feet that dance and that run;
We would still be friends with the winds that blow,
 And companions to the sun!
