[1]

 You often hear a sweet seductive call:
 If wise, you haste towards it not at all; - 
 And, if you heed my apologue,
 You act like John de Nivelle's dog.[2]

 A capon, citizen of Mans,
 Was summon'd from a throng
 To answer to the village squire,
 Before tribunal call'd the fire.
 The matter to disguise
 The kitchen sheriff wise
 Cried, 'Biddy - Biddy - Biddy! - '
 But not a moment did he - 
 This Norman and a half[3] - 
 The smooth official trust.
 'Your bait,' said he, 'is dust,
 And I'm too old for chaff.'
 Meantime, a falcon, on his perch,
 Observed the flight and search.
 In man, by instinct or experience,
 The capons have so little confidence,
 That this was not without much trouble caught,
 Though for a splendid supper sought.
 To lie, the morrow night,
 In brilliant candle-light,
 Supinely on a dish
 'Midst viands, fowl, and fish,
 With all the ease that heart could wish - 
 This honour, from his master kind,
 The fowl would gladly have declined.
 Outcried the bird of chase,
 As in the weeds he eyed the skulker's face,
 'Why, what a stupid, blockhead race! - 
 Such witless, brainless fools
 Might well defy the schools.
 For me, I understand
 To chase at word
 The swiftest bird,
 Aloft, o'er sea or land;
 At slightest beck,
 Returning quick
 To perch upon my master's hand.
 There, at his window he appears - 
 He waits thee - hasten - hast no ears?'
 'Ah! that I have,' the fowl replied;
 'But what from master might betide?
 Or cook, with cleaver at his side?
 Return you may for such a call,
 But let me fly their fatal hall;
 And spare your mirth at my expense:
 Whate'er I lack, 'tis not the sense
 To know that all this sweet-toned breath
 Is spent to lure me to my death.
 If you had seen upon the spit
 As many of the falcons roast
 As I have of the capon host,
 You would, not thus reproach my wit.'
