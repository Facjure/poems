(Man's Inhumanity to Hogs Makes Countless Thousands Squeal.)


 I lived upon a little farm,
A happy hog was I,
 I never dreamed of any harm
Nor ever thought to die.

 All day I wallowed in the mud,
And ate the choicest slops.
 I watched the brindles chew their cud--
The farmer tend his crops.

 Upon the hottest days I'd go
And flounder in the river--
 I thought that hogs might come and go,
But I would live forever.

 Then finally I waxed so fat
That I could hardly walk,
 And then the farmers gather 'round
And all began to talk.

 I couldn't understand a word,
All I did was grunt;
 You see that's all a hog can do--
It is his only stunt.

 But finally they took me out
And put me on a train.
 I really couldn't move about
And squealed with might and main.

 I grunted, grunted as I flew
And moved in vain endeavor,
 But even then I thought it true
That I would live forever.

 And so we came to Packingtown
Where there were hogs galore,
 I never saw so many hogs
In all my life before.

 Then we had to shoot the chutes
And climb a flight of stairs,
 We never had a chance to stop
Or time to say our prayers.

 Loud-squealing hogs above, below
They formed a seething river,
 For men may come and men may go
But hogs go on forever.

 And then I saw an iron wheel
Which stood alone in state,
 And then I heard an awful squeal--
A hog had met his fate.

 A devilish chain upon the wheel
Had seized him by the leg;
 It was no use to kick and squeal,
It was no use to beg.

 I longed in deepest grief and woe
To leave that brimming river;
 If once into that room you go
Your fate is sealed forever.

 Farewell, Farewell, a long farewell,
Around the room I spin,
 And then a fellow with a knife
Smites me below the chin.


 L'Envoi.

 Dear reader I was just a hog,
But O it's awful hard
 To die disgraced, and then to be--
Turned into "Pure Leaf Lard."
