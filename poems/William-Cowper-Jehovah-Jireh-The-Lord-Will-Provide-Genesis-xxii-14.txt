The saints should never be dismay�d,
Nor sink in hopeless fear;
For when they least expect his aid,
The Saviour will appear.


This Abraham found: he raised the knife;
God saw, and said, �Forbear!
Yon ram shall yield his meaner life;
Behold the victim there.�


Once David seem�d Saul�s certain prey;
But hark! the foe�s at hand;[1]
Saul turns his arms another way,
To save the invaded land.


When Jonah sunk beneath the wave,
He thought to rise no more;[2]
But God prepared a fish to save,
And bear him to the shore.


Blest proofs of power and grace divine,
That meet us in his word!
May every deep-felt care of mine
Be trusted with the Lord.


Wait for his seasonable aid,
And though it tarry, wait:
The promise may be long delay�d,
But cannot come too late.
