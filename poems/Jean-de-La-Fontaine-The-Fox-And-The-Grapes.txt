title: The Fox And The Grapes.

[1]

 A fox, almost with hunger dying,
 Some grapes upon a trellis spying,
 To all appearance ripe, clad in
 Their tempting russet skin,
 Most gladly would have eat them;
 But since he could not get them,
 So far above his reach the vine - 
 'They're sour,' he said; 'such grapes as these,
 The dogs may eat them if they please!'

 Did he not better than to whine?
