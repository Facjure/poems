We used to fear the lonely road
 That twisted round the hill;
It dipped down to the river-way,
 And passed the haunted mill,
And then crept on, until it reached
 The churchyard, green and still.

No pipers ever took that road,
 No gipsies, brown and gay;
No shepherds with their gentle flocks,
 No loads of scented hay;
No market-waggons jingled by
 On any Saturday.

The dog-wood there flung wide its stars,
 In April, silvery sweet;
The squirrels crossed that path all day
 On tiny flying feet;
The wild, brown rabbits knew each turn,
 Each shadowy safe retreat.

And there the golden-belted bee
 Sang his sweet summer song,
The crickets chirped there to the moon
 With steady note and strong;
Till cold and silence wrapped them round
 When autumn nights grew long.

But, oh! they brought the lonely dead
 Along that quiet way,
With strange procession, dark and slow,
 On sunny days and grey;
We used to watch them, wonder-eyed,
 Nor care again to play.

And we forgot each merry jest;
 The birds on bush and tree
Silenced the song within their throats
 And with us watched to see,
The soft, slow passing out of sight
 Of that dark mystery.

*****

We fear no more the lonely road
 That winds around the hill;
Far from the busy world's highway
 And the gods' slow-grinding mill;
It only seems a peaceful path,
 Pleasant, and green, and still.
