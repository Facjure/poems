When primroses are out in Spring,
 And small, blue violets come between;
 When merry birds sing on boughs green,
And rills, as soon as born, must sing;

When butterflies will make side-leaps,
 As though escaped from Nature's hand
 Ere perfect quite; and bees will stand
Upon their heads in fragrant deeps;

When small clouds are so silvery white
 Each seems a broken rimmed moon, 
 When such things are, this world too soon,
For me, doth wear the veil of Night.
