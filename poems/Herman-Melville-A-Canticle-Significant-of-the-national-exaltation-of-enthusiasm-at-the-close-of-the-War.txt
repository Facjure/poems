 O the precipice Titanic
 Of the congregated Fall,
 And the angle oceanic
 Where the deepening thunders call - 
 And the Gorge so grim,
 And the firmamental rim!
 Multitudinously thronging
 The waters all converge,
 Then they sweep adown in sloping
 Solidity of surge.

 The Nation, in her impulse
 Mysterious as the Tide,
 In emotion like an ocean
 Moves in power, not in pride;
 And is deep in her devotion
 As Humanity is wide.

 Thou Lord of hosts victorious,
 The confluence Thou hast twined;
 By a wondrous way and glorious
 A passage Thou dost find - 
 A passage Thou dost find:
 Hosanna to the Lord of hosts,
 The hosts of human kind.

 Stable in its baselessness
 When calm is in the air,
 The Iris half in tracelessness
 Hovers faintly fair.
 Fitfully assailing it
 A wind from heaven blows,
 Shivering and paling it
 To blankness of the snows;
 While, incessant in renewal,
 The Arch rekindled grows,
 Till again the gem and jewel
 Whirl in blinding overthrows - 
 Till, prevailing and transcending,
 Lo, the Glory perfect there,
 And the contest finds an ending,
 For repose is in the air.

 But the foamy Deep unsounded,
 And the dim and dizzy ledge,
 And the booming roar rebounded,
 And the gull that skims the edge!
 The Giant of the Pool
 Heaves his forehead white as wool - 
 Toward the Iris every climbing
 From the Cataracts that call - 
 Irremovable vast arras
 Draping all the Wall.

 The Generations pouring
 From times of endless date,
 In their going, in their flowing
 Ever form the steadfast State;
 And Humanity is growing
 Toward the fullness of her fate.

 Thou Lord of hosts victorious,
 Fulfill the end designed;
 By a wondrous way and glorious
 A passage Thou dost find - 
 A passage Thou dost find:
 Hosanna to the Lord of hosts,
 The hosts of human kind.
