title: To A Young Friend, On His Arriving At Cambridge Wet, When No Rain Had Fallen There.

If Gideon�s fleece, which drench�d with dew he found
While moisture none refresh�d the herbs around,
Might fitly represent the church, endow�d
With heavenly gifts to heathens not allow�d;
In pledge, perhaps, of favours from on high,
Thy locks were wet when others� locks were dry:
Heaven grant us half the omen�may we see
Not drought on others, but much dew on thee!
