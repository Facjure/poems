 Wirastrua, wirastrua, woe to me that you are dead!
 The corpse has spoken from out his bed,
 �Yesternight my burning brain
 Throbbed and beat on the strings of pain:
 Now I rest, all my dreaming�s done,
 In the world behind the sun.
 Yesterday I toiled full sore,
 To-day I ride in a coach and four.
 Yesternight in the streets I lay,
 To-night with kings, and as good as they.�
 Wirastrua! wirastrua! would I were lying as cold as you.
