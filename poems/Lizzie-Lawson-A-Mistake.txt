"MY dears, whatever are you at?
You ought to be at home;
I told you not to wet your feet -
I told you not to roam.

"Oh, dear! I'm sure you will be drowned!
I never saw such tricks
Come home at once, and go to bed,
You naughty naughty chicks."

Now most of them were five days old,
But one, whose age was six -
"Please, ma'am," said he, "I think we're ducks;
I don't believe we're chicks!"
