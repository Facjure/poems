title: I Love Thee, Sweet Mary.
---

 I love thee, sweet Mary, but love thee in fear;
 Were I but the morning breeze, healthful and airy,
 As thou goest a-walking I'd breathe in thine ear,
 And whisper and sigh, how I love thee, my Mary!

 I wish but to touch thee, but wish it in vain;
 Wert thou but a streamlet, a-winding so clearly,
 And I little globules of soft dropping rain,
 How fond would I press thy white bosom, my Mary!

 I would steal a kiss, but I dare not presume;
 Wert thou but a rose in thy garden, sweet fairy,
 And I a bold bee for to rifle its bloom,
 A whole Summer's day would I kiss thee, my Mary!

 I long to be with thee, but cannot tell how;
 Wert thou but the elder that grows by thy dairy,
 And I the blest woodbine to twine on the bough,
 I'd embrace thee and cling to thee ever, my Mary!
