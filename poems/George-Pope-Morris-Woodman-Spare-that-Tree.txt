title: Woodman, Spare that Tree!
---

Woodman, spare that tree!
 Touch not a single bough!
In youth it sheltered me,
 And I'll protect it now.
'Twas my forefather's hand
 That placed it near his cot;
There, woodman, let it stand,
 Thy axe shall harm it not.

That old familiar tree,
 Whose glory and renown
Are spread o'er land and sea--
 And wouldst thou hew it down?
Woodman, forebear thy stroke!
 Cut not its earth-bound ties;
Oh, spare that aged oak,
 Now towering to the skies!

When but an idle boy,
 I sought its grateful shade;
In all their gushing joy
 Here, too, my sisters played.
My mother kissed me here;
 My father pressed my hand--
Forgive this foolish tear,
 But let that old oak stand.

My heart-strings round thee cling,
 Close as thy bark, old friend!
Here shall the wild-bird sing,
 And still thy branches bend.
Old tree! the storm still brave!
 And, woodman, leave the spot;
While I've a hand to save,
 thy axe shall harm it not.
