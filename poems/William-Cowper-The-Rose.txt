The rose had been wash�d, just wash�d in a shower,
Which Mary to Anna convey�d,
The plentiful moisture encumber�d the flower,
And weigh�d down its beautiful head.


The cup was all fill�d, and the leaves were all wet,
And it seem�d, to a fanciful view,
To weep for the buds it had left, with regret,
On the flourishing bush where it grew.


I hastily seized it, unfit as it was
For a nosegay, so dripping and drown�d,
And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas!
I snapp�d it, it fell to the ground.


And such, I exclaim�d, is the pitiless part
Some act by the delicate mind,
Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart
Already to sorrow resign�d.


This elegant rose, had I shaken it less,
Might have bloom�d with its owner a while;
And the tear, that is wiped with a little address,
May be follow�d perhaps by a smile.
