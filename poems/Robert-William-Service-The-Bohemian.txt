 Up in my garret bleak and bare
 I tilted back on my broken chair,
 And my three old pals were with me there,
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold;
 Hunger scowled at his scurvy mate:
 Cold cowered down by the hollow grate,
 And I hated them with a deadly hate
 As old as life is old.

 So up in my garret that's near the sky
 I smiled a smile that was thin and dry:
 "You've roomed with me twenty year," said I,
 "Hunger and Thirst and Cold;
 But now, begone down the broken stair!
 I've suffered enough of your spite . . . so there!"
 Bang! Bang! I slapped on the table bare
 A glittering heap of gold.

 "Red flames will jewel my wine to-night;
 I'll loose my belt that you've lugged so tight;
 Ha! Ha! Dame Fortune is smiling bright;
 The stuff of my brain I've sold;
 Canaille of the gutter, up! Away!
 You've battened on me for a bitter-long day;
 But I'm driving you forth, and forever and aye,
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold."

 So I kicked them out with a scornful roar;
 Yet, oh, they turned at the garret door;
 Quietly there they spoke once more:
 "The tale is not all told.
 It's au revoir, but it's not good-by;
 We're yours, old chap, till the day you die;
 Laugh on, you fool! Oh, you'll never defy
 Hunger and Thirst and Cold."
