title: The Burdens Of All.
---

 We may sigh o'er the heavy burdens
 Of the black, the brown and white;
 But if we all clasped hands together
 The burdens would be more light.
 How to solve life's saddest problems,
 Its weariness, want and woe,
 Was answered by One who suffered
 In Palestine long ago.

 He gave from his heart this precept,
 To ease the burdens of men,
 "As ye would that others do to you
 Do ye even so to them."
 Life's heavy, wearisome burdens
 Will change to a gracious trust
 When men shall learn in the light of God
 To be merciful and just.

 Where war has sharpened his weapons,
 And slavery masterful had,
 Let white and black and brown unite
 To build the kingdom of God.
 And never attempt in madness
 To build a kingdom or state,
 Through greed of gold or lust of power,
 On the crumbling stones of hate.

 The burdens will always he heavy,
 The sunshine fade into night,
 Till mercy and justice shall cement
 The black, the brown and the white.
 And earth shall answer with gladness,
 The herald angel's refrain,
 When "Peace on earth, good will to men"
 Was the burden of their strain.
