 A little baby went to sleep
One night in his white bed,
 And the moon came by to take a peep
At the little baby head.

 A wind, as wandering winds will do,
Brought to the baby there
 Sweet smells from some quaint flower that grew
Out on some hill somewhere.

 And wind and flower and pale moonbeam
About the baby's bed
 Stirred and woke the funniest dream
In the little sleepy head.

 He thought he was all sorts of things
From a lion to a cat;
 Sometimes he thought he flew on wings,
Or fell and fell, so that

 When morning broke he was right glad
But much surprised to see
 Himself a soft, pink little lad
Just like he used to be.

 I would not give this story fame
If there were room to doubt it,
 But when he learned to talk, he came
And told me all about it.
