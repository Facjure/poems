Good night! from music's softest spell
 Go to thy dreams: and in thy slumbers,
Fairies, with magic harp and shell,
 Sing o'er to thee thy own sweet numbers.

Good night! from Hope's intense desire
 Go to thy dreams: and may to-morrow,
Love with the sun returning, fire
 These evening mists of doubt and sorrow.

Good night! from hours of weary waking
 I'll to my dreams: still in my sleep
To feel the spirit's restless aching,
 And ev'n with eyelids closed, to weep.
