title: Sweet Are The Flowers Of Life,[1]
---

"Sweet are the flowers of life,
Swept o'er my happy days at home;
Sweet are the flowers of life
When I was a little child.


"Sweet are the flowers of life
That I spent with my father at home;
Sweet are the flowers of life
When children played about the house.


"Sweet are the flowers of life
When the lamps are lighted at night;
Sweet are the flowers of life
When the flowers of summer bloomed.


"Sweet are the flowers of life
Dead with the snows of winter;
Sweet are the flowers of life
When the days of spring come on.

(1) These lines were actually composed by a six-year old child.
