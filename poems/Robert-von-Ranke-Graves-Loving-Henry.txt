title: Loving Henry.

 Henry, Henry, do you love me?
 Do I love you, Mary?
 Oh, can you mean to liken me
 To the aspen tree.
 Whose leaves do shake and vary,
 From white to green
 And back again,
 Shifting and contrary?

 Henry, Henry, do you love me,
 Do you love me truly?
 Oh, Mary, must I say again
 My love's a pain,
 A torment most unruly?
 It tosses me
 Like a ship at sea
 When the storm rages fully.

 Henry, Henry, why do you love me?
 Mary, dear, have pity!
 I swear, of all the girls there are
 Both near and far,
 In country or in city,
 There's none like you,
 So kind, so true,
 So wise, so brave, so pretty.
