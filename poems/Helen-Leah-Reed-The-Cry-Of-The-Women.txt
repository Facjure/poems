title: The Cry Of The Women
---

A new year dawning on a warring world!
And many fight, and many pray for peace;
But yet the roar of battle will not cease,
Still man against his brother man is hurled.

So we who wait - we women in our woe,
 Who wait and work - who wait, and work, and weep - 
 For us there is no rest, for us no sleep,
As our sad thoughts are wandering grim and slow,

Across those dreary fields where far away
 Our hero myriads bleed and burn and die,
 We lift our hearts toward the pitying sky - 
Dawns there no hope upon this New Year's day?

 1915
