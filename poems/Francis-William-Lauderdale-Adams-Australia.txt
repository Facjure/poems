 I see a land of desperate droughts and floods:
 I see a land where need keeps spreading round,
 And all but giants perish in the stress:
 I see a land where more, and more, and more
 The demons, Earth and Wealth, grow bloat and strong.

 I see a land that lies a helpless prey
 To wealthy cliques and gamblers and their slaves,
 The huckster politicians: a poor land
 That less and less can make her heart-wish law.

 Yea, but I see a land where some few brave
 Raise clear eyes to the Struggle that must come,
 Reaching firm hands to draw the doubters in,
 Preaching the gospel: "Drill and drill and drill!"
 Yea, but I see a land where best of all
 The hope of victory burns strong and bright!
