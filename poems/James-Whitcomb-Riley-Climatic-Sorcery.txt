 When frost's all on our winder, an' the snow's
 All out-o'-doors, our "Old-Kriss"-milkman goes
 A-drivin' round, ist purt'-nigh froze to death,
 With his old white mustache froze full o' breath.

 But when it's summer an' all warm ag'in,
 He comes a-whistlin' an' a-drivin in
 Our alley, 'thout no coat on, ner ain't cold,
 Ner his mustache ain't white, ner he ain't old.
