 I looked upon a dead girl's face and heard
 What seemed the voice of Love call unto me
 Out of her heart; whereon the charactery
 Of her lost dreams I read there word for word: 
 How on her soul no soul had touched, or stirred
 Her Life's sad depths to rippling melody,
 Or made the imaged longing, there, to be
 The realization of a hope deferred.
 So in her life had Love behaved to her.
 Between the lonely chapters of her years
 And her young eyes making no golden blur
 With god-bright face and hair; who led me to
 Her side at last, and bade me, through my tears,
 With Death's dumb face, too late, to see and know.
