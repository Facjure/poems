title: The Dead Joke And The Funny Man
---

 Long years ago, a funny man,
Flushed with a strange delight,
 Sat down and wrote a funny thing
All in the solemn night;
 And as he wrote he clapped his hands
And laughed with all his might.
 For it was such a funny thing,
 O, such a very funny thing,
 This wonderfully funny thing,
He
 Laughed
Outright.

 And so it was this funny man
Printed this funny thing -
 Forgot it, too, nor ever thought
It worth remembering,
 Till but a day or two ago.
(Ah! what may changes bring!)
 He found this selfsame funny thing
 In an exchange - "O, funny thing!"
 He cried, "You dear old funny thing!"
And
 Sobbed
Outright.
