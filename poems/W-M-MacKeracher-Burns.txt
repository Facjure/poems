We read his life of poverty and bane,
 From weakness, folly, error, not exempt,
And turn aside with a depressing pain -
 Compassion tinged with something like contempt.
We read his work, and see his human heart,
 His manly mind, his true, if thwarted, will,
And all that's noblest in us takes his part,
 And shames our former verdict, will or nill.

His was a fiery spirit that unbound
 Men's fetters, sometimes leading him astray;
He was a seed that fell into the ground
 And brought forth fruit; he cast himself away
Like bread upon the waters, and was found
 To nourish worth in many an after day.
