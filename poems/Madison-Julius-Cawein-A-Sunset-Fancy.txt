 Wide in the west, a lake
 Of flame that seems to shake
 As if the Midgard snake
 Deep down did breathe:
 An isle of purple glow,
 Where rosy rivers flow
 Down peaks of cloudy snow
 With fire beneath.

 And there the Tower-of-Night,
 With windows all a-light,
 Frowns on a burning height;
 Wherein she sleeps,
 Young through the years of doom,
 Veiled with her hair's gold gloom,
 The pale Valkyrie whom
 Enchantment keeps.
