 We're The Twins from Aunt Marinn's,
Igo and Ago.
 When Dad comes, the show begins! - 
Iram, coram, dago.

 Dad he says he named us two
Igo and Ago
 For a poem he always knew,
Iram, coram, dago.

 Then he was a braw Scotchman - 
Igo and Ago. - 
 Now he's Scotch-Amer-i-can.
Iram, coram, dago.

 "Hey!" he cries, and pats his knee,
"Igo and Ago,
 My twin bairnies, ride wi' me - 
Iram, coram, dago!"



 "Here," he laughs, "ye've each a leg,
Igo and Ago,
 Gleg as Tam O'Shanter's 'Meg'!
Iram, coram, dago!"

 Then we mount, with shrieks of mirth - 
Igo and Ago, - 
 The two gladdest twins on earth!
Iram, coram, dago.

 Wade and Silas-Walker cry, - 
"Igo and Ago - 
 Annie's kissin' 'em 'good-bye'!" - 
Iram, coram, dago.

 Aunty waves us fond farewells. - 
"Igo and Ago,"
 Granny pipes, "tak care yersels!"
Iram, coram, dago.
