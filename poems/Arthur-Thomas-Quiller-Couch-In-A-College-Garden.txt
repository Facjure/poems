 Senex.Saye, cushat, callynge from the brake,
 What ayles thee soe to pyne?
 Thy carefulle heart shall cease to ake
 When dayes be fyne
 And greene thynges twyne:
 Saye, cushat, what thy griefe to myne?


Turtur.Naye, gossyp, loyterynge soe late,
 What ayles thee thus to chyde?
 My love is fled by garden-gate;
 Since Lammas-tyde
 I wayte my bryde.
 Saye, gossyp, whom dost thou abyde?

 Senex.Loe! I am he, the 'Lonelie Manne,'
 Of Time forgotten quite,
 That no remembered face may scanne--
 Sadde eremyte,
 I wayte tonyghte
 Pale Death, nor any other wyghte.

 O cushat, cushat, callynge lowe,
 Goe waken Time from sleepe:
 Goe whysper in his ear, that soe
 His besom sweepe
 Me to that heape
 Where all my recollections keepe.

 Hath he forgott?Or did I viewe
 A ghostlye companye
 This even, by the dismalle yewe,
 Of faces three
 That beckoned mee
 To land where no repynynges bee?

 O Harrye, Harrye, Tom and Dicke,
 Each lost companion!
 Why loyter I among the quicke,
 When ye are gonne?
 Shalle I alone
 Delayinge crye 'Anon, Anon'?

 Naye, let the spyder have my gowne,
 To brayde therein her veste.
 My cappe shal serve, now I 'goe downe,'
 For mouse's neste.
 Loe! this is best.
 I care not, soe I gayne my reste.
