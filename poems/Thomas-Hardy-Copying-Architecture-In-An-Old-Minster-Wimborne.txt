title: Copying Architecture In An Old Minster (Wimborne)

 How smartly the quarters of the hour march by
 That the jack-o'-clock never forgets;
 Ding-dong; and before I have traced a cusp's eye,
Or got the true twist of the ogee over,
 A double ding-dong ricochetts.

 Just so did he clang here before I came,
 And so will he clang when I'm gone
 Through the Minster's cavernous hollows - the same
Tale of hours never more to be will he deliver
 To the speechless midnight and dawn!

 I grow to conceive it a call to ghosts,
 Whose mould lies below and around.
 Yes; the next "Come, come," draws them out from their posts,
And they gather, and one shade appears, and another,
 As the eve-damps creep from the ground.

 See - a Courtenay stands by his quatre-foiled tomb,
 And a Duke and his Duchess near;
 And one Sir Edmund in columned gloom,
And a Saxon king by the presbytery chamber;
 And shapes unknown in the rear.

 Maybe they have met for a parle on some plan
 To better ail-stricken mankind;
 I catch their cheepings, though thinner than
The overhead creak of a passager's pinion
 When leaving land behind.

 Or perhaps they speak to the yet unborn,
 And caution them not to come
 To a world so ancient and trouble-torn,
Of foiled intents, vain lovingkindness,
 And ardours chilled and numb.

 They waste to fog as I stir and stand,
 And move from the arched recess,
 And pick up the drawing that slipped from my hand,
And feel for the pencil I dropped in the cranny
 In a moment's forgetfulness.
