 This is the song
 The spice-tree sings:
 "Hunger and fire,
 Hunger and fire,
 Sky-born Beauty - 
 Spice of desire,"
 Under the spice-tree
 Watch and wait,
 Burning maidens
 And lads that mate.

 The spice-tree spreads
 And its boughs come down
 Shadowing village and farm and town.
 And none can see
 But the pure of heart
 The great green leaves
 And the boughs descending,
 And hear the song that is never ending.

 The deep roots whisper,
 The branches say: - 
 "Love to-morrow,
 And love to-day,
 And till Heaven's day,
 And till Heaven's day."

 The moon is a bird's nest in its branches,
 The moon is hung in its topmost spaces.
 And there, to-night, two doves play house
 While lovers watch with uplifted faces.
 Two doves go home
 To their nest, the moon.
 It is woven of twigs of broken light,
 With threads of scarlet and threads of gray
 And a lining of down for silk delight.
 To their Eden, the moon, fly home our doves,
 Up through the boughs of the great spice-tree; - 
 And one is the kiss I took from you,
 And one is the kiss you gave to me.
