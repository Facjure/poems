 Argument Of The Twelfth Book.


 The Trojans assail the ramparts, and Hector forces the gates.



 So was Menoetius' gallant son employ'd
 Healing Eurypylus. The Greeks, meantime,
 And Trojans with tumultuous fury fought.
 Nor was the foss ordain'd long time to exclude
 The host of Troy, nor yet the rampart built
 Beside it for protection of the fleet;
 For hecatomb the Greeks had offer'd none,
 Nor prayer to heaven, that it might keep secure
 Their ships with all their spoils. The mighty work
 As in defiance of the Immortal Powers
 Had risen, and could not therefore long endure.
 While Hector lived, and while Achilles held
 His wrathful purpose; while the city yet
 Of royal Priam was unsack'd, so long
 The massy structure stood; but when the best
 And bravest of the Trojan host were slain,
 And of the Grecian heroes, some had fallen
 And some survived, when Priam's towers had blazed
 In the tenth year, and to their native shores
 The Grecians with their ships, at length, return'd,
 Then Neptune, with Apollo leagued, devised
 Its ruin; every river that descends
 From the Id�an heights into the sea
 They brought against it, gathering all their force.
 Rhesus, Caresus, Rhodius, the wide-branch'd
 Heptaporus, �sepus, Granicus,
 Scamander's sacred current, and thy stream
 Sim�is, whose banks with helmets and with shields
 Were strew'd, and Chiefs of origin divine;
 All these with refluent course Apollo drove
 Nine days against the rampart, and Jove rain'd
 Incessant, that the Grecian wall wave-whelm'd
 Through all its length might sudden disappear.
 Neptune with his tridental mace, himself,
 Led them, and beam and buttress to the flood
 Consigning, laid by the laborious Greeks,
 Swept the foundation, and the level bank
 Of the swift-rolling Hellespont restored.
 The structure thus effaced, the spacious beach
 He spread with sand as at the first; then bade
 Subside the streams, and in their channels wind
 With limpid course, and pleasant as before,
 Apollo thus and Neptune, from the first,
 Design'd its fall; but now the battle raved
 And clamors of the warriors all around
 The strong-built turrets, whose assaulted planks
 Rang, while the Grecians, by the scourge of Jove
 Subdued, stood close within their fleet immured,
 At Hector's phalanx-scattering force appall'd.
 He, as before, with whirlwind fury fought.
 As when the boar or lion fiery-eyed
 Turns short, the hunters and the hounds among,
 The close-embattled troop him firm oppose,
 And ply him fast with spears; he no dismay
 Conceives or terror in his noble heart,
 But by his courage falls; frequent he turns
 Attempting bold the ranks, and where he points
 Direct his onset, there the ranks retire;
 So, through the concourse on his rolling wheels
 Borne rapid, Hector animated loud
 His fellow-warriors to surpass the trench.
 But not his own swift-footed steeds would dare
 That hazard; standing on the dangerous brink
 They neigh'd aloud, for by its breadth the foss
 Deterr'd them; neither was the effort slight
 To leap that gulf, nor easy the attempt
 To pass it through; steep were the banks profound
 On both sides, and with massy piles acute
 Thick-planted, interdicting all assault.
 No courser to the rapid chariot braced
 Had enter'd there with ease; yet strong desires
 Possess'd the infantry of that emprize,
 And thus Polydamas the ear address'd
 Of dauntless Hector, standing at his side.
 Hector, and ye the leaders of our host,
 Both Trojans and allies! rash the attempt
 I deem, and vain, to push our horses through,
 So dangerous is the pass; rough is the trench
 With pointed stakes, and the Achaian wall
 Meets us beyond. No chariot may descend
 Or charioteer fight there; strait are the bounds,
 And incommodious, and his death were sure.
 If Jove, high-thundering Ruler of the skies,
 Will succor Ilium, and nought less intend
 Than utter devastation of the Greeks,
 I am content; now perish all their host
 Inglorious, from their country far remote.
 But should they turn, and should ourselves be driven
 Back from the fleet impeded and perplex'd
 In this deep foss, I judge that not a man,
 'Scaping the rallied Grecians, should survive
 To bear the tidings of our fate to Troy.
 Now, therefore, act we all as I advise.
 Let every charioteer his coursers hold
 Fast-rein'd beside the foss, while we on foot,
 With order undisturb'd and arms in hand,
 Shall follow Hector. If destruction borne
 On wings of destiny this day approach
 The Grecians, they will fly our first assault.
 So spake Polydamas, whose safe advice
 Pleased Hector; from his chariot to the ground
 All arm'd he leap'd, nor would a Trojan there
 (When once they saw the Hero on his feet)
 Ride into battle, but unanimous
 Descending with a leap, all trod the plain.
 Each gave command that at the trench his steeds
 Should stand detain'd in orderly array;
 Then, suddenly, the parted host became
 Five bands, each following its appointed chief.
 The bravest and most numerous, and whose hearts
 Wish'd most to burst the barrier and to wage
 The battle at the ships, with Hector march'd
 And with Polydamas, whom follow'd, third,
 Cebriones; for Hector had his steeds
 Consign'd and chariot to inferior care.
 Paris, Alcatho�s, and Agenor led
 The second band, and, sons of Priam both,
 De�phobus and Helenus, the third;
 With them was seen partner of their command;
 The Hero Asius; from Arisba came
 Asius Hyrtacides, to battle drawn
 From the Selle�s banks by martial steeds
 Hair'd fiery-red and of the noblest size.
 The fourth, Anchises' mighty son controll'd,
 �neas; under him Antenor's sons,
 Archilochus and Acamas, advanced,
 Adept in all the practice of the field.
 Last came the glorious powers in league with Troy
 Led by Sarpedon; he with Glaucus shared
 His high control, and with the warlike Chief
 Asterop�us; for of all his host
 Them bravest he esteem'd, himself except
 Superior in heroic might to all.
 And now (their shields adjusted each to each)
 With dauntless courage fired, right on they moved
 Against the Grecians; nor expected less
 Than that beside their sable ships, the host
 Should self-abandon'd fall an easy prey.
 The Trojans, thus with their confederate powers,
 The counsel of the accomplish'd Prince pursued,
 Polydamas, one Chief alone except,
 Asius Hyrtacides. He scorn'd to leave
 His charioteer and coursers at the trench,
 And drove toward the fleet. Ah, madly brave!
 His evil hour was come; he was ordain'd
 With horse and chariot and triumphant shout
 To enter wind-swept Ilium never more.
 Deucalion's offspring, first, into the shades
 Dismiss'd him; by Idomeneus he died.
 Leftward he drove furious, along the road
 By which the steeds and chariots of the Greeks
 Return'd from battle; in that track he flew,
 Nor found the portals by the massy bar
 Secured, but open for reception safe
 Of fugitives, and to a guard consign'd.
 Thither he drove direct, and in his rear
 His band shrill-shouting follow'd, for they judged
 The Greeks no longer able to withstand
 Their foes, but sure to perish in the camp.
 Vain hope! for in the gate two Chiefs they found
 Lapith�-born, courageous offspring each
 Of dauntless father; Polypoetes, this,
 Sprung from Pirith�us; that, the warrior bold
 Leonteus, terrible as gore-tainted Mars.
 These two, defenders of the lofty gates,
 Stood firm before them. As when two tall oaks
 On the high mountains day by day endure
 Rough wind and rain, by deep-descending roots
 Of hugest growth fast-founded in the soil;
 So they, sustain'd by conscious valor, saw,
 Unmoved, high towering Asius on his way,
 Nor fear'd him aught, nor shrank from his approach
 Right on toward the barrier, lifting high
 Their season'd bucklers and with clamor loud
 The band advanced, King Asius at their head,
 With whom I�menus, expert in arms,
 Orestes, Th�on, Acamas the son
 Of Asius, and Oenom�us, led them on.
 Till now, the warlike pair, exhorting loud
 The Grecians to defend the fleet, had stood
 Within the gates; but soon as they perceived
 The Trojans swift advancing to the wall,
 And heard a cry from all the flying Greeks,
 Both sallying, before the gates they fought
 Like forest-boars, which hearing in the hills
 The crash of hounds and huntsmen nigh at hand,
 With start oblique lay many a sapling flat
 Short-broken by the root, nor cease to grind
 Their sounding tusks, till by the spear they die;
 So sounded on the breasts of those brave two
 The smitten brass; for resolute they fought,
 Embolden'd by their might who kept the wall,
 And trusting in their own; they, in defence
 Of camp and fleet and life, thick battery hurl'd
 Of stones precipitated from the towers;
 Frequent as snows they fell, which stormy winds,
 Driving the gloomy clouds, shake to the ground,
 Till all the fertile earth lies cover'd deep.
 Such volley pour'd the Greeks, and such return'd
 The Trojans; casques of hide, arid and tough,
 And bossy shields rattled, by such a storm
 Assail'd of millstone masses from above.
 Then Asius, son of Hyrtacus, a groan
 Indignant utter'd; on both thighs he smote
 With disappointment furious, and exclaim'd,
 Jupiter! even thou art false become,
 And altogether such. Full sure I deem'd
 That not a Grecian hero should abide
 One moment force invincible as ours,
 And lo! as wasps ring-streaked,[1] or bees that build
 Their dwellings in the highway's craggy side
 Leave not their hollow home, but fearless wait
 The hunter's coming, in their brood's defence,
 So these, although two only, from the gates
 Move not, nor will, till either seized or slain.
 So Asius spake, but speaking so, changed not
 The mind of Jove on Hector's glory bent.
 Others, as obstinate, at other gates
 Such deeds perform'd, that to enumerate all
 Were difficult, unless to power divine.
 For fierce the hail of stones from end to end
 Smote on the barrier; anguish fill'd the Greeks.
 Yet, by necessity constrain'd, their ships
 They guarded still; nor less the Gods themselves,
 Patrons of Greece, all sorrow'd at the sight.
 At once the valiant Lapith� began
 Terrible conflict, and Pirithous' son
 Brave Polypoetes through his helmet pierced
 Damasus; his resplendent point the brass
 Sufficed not to withstand; entering, it crush'd
 The bone within, and mingling all his brain
 With his own blood, his onset fierce repress'd.
 Pylon and Ormenus he next subdued.
 Meantime Leonteus, branch of Mars, his spear
 Hurl'd at Hippomachus, whom through his belt
 He pierced; then drawing forth his falchion keen,
 Through all the multitude he flew to smite
 Antiphates, and with a downright stroke
 Fell'd him. I�menus and Menon next
 He slew, with brave Orestes, whom he heap'd,
 All three together, on the fertile glebe.
 While them the Lapith� of their bright arms
 Despoil'd, Polydamas and Hector stood
 (With all the bravest youths and most resolved
 To burst the barrier and to fire the fleet)
 Beside the foss, pondering the event.
 For, while they press'd to pass, they spied a bird
 Sublime in air, an eagle. Right between
 Both hosts he soar'd (the Trojan on his left)
 A serpent bearing in his pounces clutch'd
 Enormous, dripping blood, but lively still
 And mindful of revenge; for from beneath
 The eagle's breast, updarting fierce his head,
 Fast by the throat he struck him; anguish-sick
 The eagle cast him down into the space
 Between the hosts, and, clanging loud his plumes
 As the wind bore him, floated far away.
 Shudder'd the Trojans viewing at their feet
 The spotted serpent ominous, and thus
 Polydamas to dauntless Hector spake.
 Ofttimes in council, Hector, thou art wont
 To censure me, although advising well;
 Nor ought the private citizen, I confess,
 Either in council or in war to indulge
 Loquacity, but ever to employ
 All his exertions in support of thine.
 Yet hear my best opinion once again.
 Proceed we not in our attempt against
 The Grecian fleet. For if in truth the sign
 Respect the host of Troy ardent to pass,
 Then, as the eagle soar'd both hosts between,
 With Ilium's on his left, and clutch'd a snake
 Enormous, dripping blood, but still alive,
 Which yet he dropp'd suddenly, ere he reach'd
 His eyry, or could give it to his young,
 So we, although with mighty force we burst
 Both gates and barrier, and although the Greeks
 Should all retire, shall never yet the way
 Tread honorably back by which we came.
 No. Many a Trojan shall we leave behind
 Slain by the Grecians in their fleet's defence.
 An augur skill'd in omens would expound
 This omen thus, and faith would win from all.
 To whom, dark-louring, Hector thus replied.
 Polydamas! I like not thy advice;
 Thou couldst have framed far better; but if this
 Be thy deliberate judgment, then the Gods
 Make thy deliberate judgment nothing worth,
 Who bidd'st me disregard the Thunderer's[2] firm
 Assurance to myself announced, and make
 The wild inhabitants of air my guides,
 Which I alike despise, speed they their course
 With right-hand flight toward the ruddy East,
 Or leftward down into the shades of eve.
 Consider we the will of Jove alone,
 Sovereign of heaven and earth. Omens abound,
 But the best omen is our country's cause.[3]
 Wherefore should fiery war thy soul alarm?
 For were we slaughter'd, one and all, around
 The fleet of Greece, thou need'st not fear to die,
 Whose courage never will thy flight retard.
 But if thou shrink thyself, or by smooth speech
 Seduce one other from a soldier's part,
 Pierced by this spear incontinent thou diest.
 So saying he led them, who with deafening roar
 Follow'd him. Then, from the Id�an hills
 Jove hurl'd a storm which wafted right the dust
 Into the fleet; the spirits too he quell'd
 Of the Achaians, and the glory gave
 To Hector and his host; they, trusting firm
 In signs from Jove, and in their proper force,
 Assay'd the barrier; from the towers they tore
 The galleries, cast the battlements to ground,
 And the projecting buttresses adjoin'd
 To strengthen the vast work, with bars upheaved.
 All these, with expectation fierce to break
 The rampart, down they drew; nor yet the Greeks
 Gave back, but fencing close with shields the wall,
 Smote from behind them many a foe beneath.
 Meantime from tower to tower the Ajaces moved
 Exhorting all; with mildness some, and some
 With harsh rebuke, whom they observed through fear
 Declining base the labors of the fight,
 Friends! Argives! warriors of whatever rank!
 Ye who excel, and ye of humbler note!
 And ye the last and least! (for such there are,
 All have not magnanimity alike)
 Now have we work for all, as all perceive.
 Turn not, retreat not to your ships, appall'd
 By sounding menaces, but press the foe;
 Exhort each other, and e'en now perchance
 Olympian Jove, by whom the lightnings burn,
 Shall grant us to repulse them, and to chase
 The routed Trojans to their gates again.
 So they vociferating to the Greeks,
 Stirr'd them to battle. As the feathery snows
 Fall frequent, on some wintry day, when Jove
 Hath risen to shed them on the race of man,
 And show his arrowy stores; he lulls the winds,
 Then shakes them down continual, covering thick
 Mountain tops, promontories, flowery meads,
 And cultured valleys rich; the ports and shores
 Receive it also of the hoary deep,
 But there the waves bound it, while all beside
 Lies whelm'd beneath Jove's fast-descending shower,
 So thick, from side to side, by Trojans hurl'd
 Against the Greeks, and by the Greeks return'd
 The stony vollies flew; resounding loud
 Through all its length the battered rampart roar'd.
 Nor yet had Hector and his host prevail'd
 To burst the gates, and break the massy bar,
 Had not all-seeing Jove Sarpedon moved
 His son, against the Greeks, furious as falls
 The lion on some horned herd of beeves.
 At once his polish'd buckler he advanced
 With leafy brass o'erlaid; for with smooth brass
 The forger of that shield its oval disk
 Had plated, and with thickest hides throughout
 Had lined it, stitch'd with circling wires of gold.
 That shield he bore before him; firmly grasp'd
 He shook two spears, and with determined strides
 March'd forward. As the lion mountain-bred,
 After long fast, by impulse of his heart
 Undaunted urged, seeks resolute the flock
 Even in the shelter of their guarded home;
 He finds, perchance, the shepherds arm'd with spears,
 And all their dogs awake, yet can not leave
 Untried the fence, but either leaps it light,
 And entering tears the prey, or in the attempt
 Pierced by some dexterous peasant, bleeds himself;
 So high his courage to the assault impell'd
 Godlike Sarpedon, and him fired with hope
 To break the barrier; when to Glaucus thus,
 Son of Hippolochus, his speech he turn'd.
 Why, Glaucus, is the seat of honor ours,
 Why drink we brimming cups, and feast in state?
 Why gaze they all on us as we were Gods
 In Lycia, and why share we pleasant fields
 And spacious vineyards, where the Xanthus winds?
 Distinguished thus in Lycia, we are call'd
 To firmness here, and to encounter bold
 The burning battle, that our fair report
 Among the Lycians may be blazon'd thus--
 No dastards are the potentates who rule
 The bright-arm'd Lycians; on the fatted flock
 They banquet, and they drink the richest wines;
 But they are also valiant, and the fight
 Wage dauntless in the vanward of us all.
 Oh Glaucus, if escaping safe the death
 That threats us here, we also could escape
 Old age, and to ourselves secure a life
 Immortal, I would neither in the van
 Myself expose, nor would encourage thee
 To tempt the perils of the glorious field.
 But since a thousand messengers of fate
 Pursue us close, and man is born to die--
 E'en let us on; the prize of glory yield,
 If yield we must, or wrest it from the foe.
 He said, nor cold refusal in return
 Received from Glaucus, but toward the wall
 Their numerous Lycian host both led direct.
 Menestheus, son of Peteos, saw appall'd
 Their dread approach, for to his tower they bent;
 Their threatening march. An eager look he cast,
 On the embodied Greeks, seeking some Chief
 Whose aid might turn the battle from his van:
 He saw, where never sated with exploits
 Of war, each Ajax fought, near whom his eye
 Kenn'd Teucer also, newly from his tent;
 But vain his efforts were with loudest call
 To reach their ears, such was the deafening din
 Upsent to heaven, of shields and crested helms,
 And of the batter'd gates; for at each gate
 They thundering' stood, and urged alike at each
 Their fierce attempt by force to burst the bars.
 To Ajax therefore he at once dispatch'd
 A herald, and Th�otes thus enjoin'd.
 My noble friend, Th�otes! with all speed
 Call either Ajax; bid them hither both;
 Far better so; for havoc is at hand.
 The Lycian leaders, ever in assault
 Tempestuous, bend their force against this tower
 My station. But if also there they find
 Laborious conflict pressing them severe,
 At least let Telamonian Ajax come,
 And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.
 He spake, nor was Th�otes slow to hear;
 Beside the rampart of the mail-clad Greeks
 Rapid he flew, and, at their side arrived,
 To either Ajax, eager, thus began.
 Ye leaders of the well-appointed Greeks,
 The son of noble Peteos calls; he begs
 With instant suit, that ye would share his toils,
 However short your stay; the aid of both
 Will serve him best, for havoc threatens there
 The Lycian leaders, ever in assault
 Tempestuous, bend their force toward the tower
 His station. But if also here ye find
 Laborious conflict pressing you severe,
 At least let Telamonian Ajax come,
 And Teucer with his death-dispensing bow.
 He spake, nor his request the towering son
 Of Telamon denied, but quick his speech
 To Ajax O�liades address'd.
 Ajax! abiding here, exhort ye both
 (Heroic Lycomedes and thyself)
 The Greeks to battle. Thither I depart
 To aid our friends, which service once perform'd
 Duly, I will incontinent return.
 So saying, the Telamonian Chief withdrew
 With whom went Teucer, son of the same sire,
 Pandion also, bearing Teucer's bow.
 Arriving at the turret given in charge
 To the bold Chief Menestheus, and the wall
 Entering, they found their friends all sharply tried.
 Black as a storm the senators renown'd
 And leaders of the Lycian host assail'd
 Buttress and tower, while opposite the Greeks
 Withstood them, and the battle-shout began.
 First, Ajax, son of Telamon, a friend
 And fellow-warrior of Sarpedon slew,
 Epicles. With a marble fragment huge
 That crown'd the battlement's interior side,
 He smote him. No man of our puny race,
 Although in prime of youth, had with both hands
 That weight sustain'd; but he the cumberous mass
 Uplifted high, and hurl'd it on his head.
 It burst his helmet, and his batter'd skull
 Dash'd from all form. He from the lofty tower
 Dropp'd downright, with a diver's plunge, and died.
 But Teucer wounded Glaucus with a shaft
 Son of Hippolochus; he, climbing, bared
 His arm, which Teucer, marking, from the wall
 Transfix'd it, and his onset fierce repress'd;
 For with a backward leap Glaucus withdrew
 Sudden and silent, cautious lest the Greeks
 Seeing him wounded should insult his pain.
 Grief seized, at sight of his retiring friend,
 Sarpedon, who forgat not yet the fight,
 But piercing with his lance Alcmaon, son
 Of Thestor, suddenly reversed the beam,
 Which following, Alcmaon to the earth
 Fell prone, with clangor of his brazen arms.
 Sarpedon, then, strenuous with both hands
 Tugg'd, and down fell the battlement entire;
 The wall, dismantled at the summit, stood
 A ruin, and wide chasm was open'd through.
 Then Ajax him and Teucer at one time
 Struck both; an arrow struck from Teucer's bow
 The belt that cross'd his bosom, by which hung
 His ample shield; yet lest his son should fall
 Among the ships, Jove turn'd the death aside.
 But Ajax, springing to his thrust, a spear
 Drove through his shield. Sarpedon at the shock
 With backward step short interval recoil'd,
 But not retired, for in his bosom lived
 The hope of glory still, and, looking back
 On all his godlike Lycians, he exclaim'd,
 Oh Lycians! where is your heroic might?
 Brave as I boast myself, I feel the task
 Arduous, through the breach made by myself
 To win a passage to the ships, alone.
 Follow me all--Most laborers, most dispatch.[4]
 So he; at whose sharp reprimand abash'd
 The embattled host to closer conflict moved,
 Obedient to their counsellor and King.
 On the other side the Greeks within the wall
 Made firm the phalanx, seeing urgent need;
 Nor could the valiant Lycians through the breach
 Admittance to the Grecian fleet obtain,
 Nor since they first approach'd it, had the Greeks
 With all their efforts, thrust the Lycians back.
 But as two claimants of one common field,
 Each with his rod of measurement in hand,
 Dispute the boundaries, litigating warm
 Their right in some small portion of the soil,
 So they, divided by the barrier, struck
 With hostile rage the bull-hide bucklers round,
 And the light targets on each other's breast.
 Then many a wound the ruthless weapons made.
 Pierced through the unarm'd back, if any turn'd,
 He died, and numerous even through the shield.
 The battlements from end to end with blood
 Of Grecians and of Trojans on both sides
 Were sprinkled; yet no violence could move
 The stubborn Greeks, or turn their powers to flight.
 So hung the war in balance, as the scales
 Held by some woman scrupulously just,
 A spinner; wool and weight she poises nice,
 Hard-earning slender pittance for her babes,[5]
 Such was the poise in which the battle hung
 Till Jove himself superior fame, at length,
 To Priam�ian Hector gave, who sprang
 First through the wall. In lofty sounds that reach'd
 Their utmost ranks, he call'd on all his host.
 Now press them, now ye Trojans steed-renown'd
 Rush on! break through the Grecian rampart, hurl
 At once devouring flames into the fleet.
 Such was his exhortation; they his voice
 All hearing, with close-order'd ranks direct
 Bore on the barrier, and up-swarming show'd
 On the high battlement their glittering spears.
 But Hector seized a stone; of ample base
 But tapering to a point, before the gate
 It stood. No two men, mightiest of a land
 (Such men as now are mighty) could with ease
 Have heaved it from the earth up to a wain;
 He swung it easily alone; so light
 The son of Saturn made it in his hand.
 As in one hand with ease the shepherd bears
 A ram's fleece home, nor toils beneath the weight,
 So Hector, right toward the planks of those
 Majestic folding-gates, close-jointed, firm
 And solid, bore the stone. Two bars within
 Their corresponding force combined transvere
 To guard them, and one bolt secured the bars.
 He stood fast by them, parting wide his feet
 For 'vantage sake, and smote them in the midst.
 He burst both hinges; inward fell the rock
 Ponderous, and the portals roar'd; the bars
 Endured not, and the planks, riven by the force
 Of that huge mass, flew scatter'd on all sides.
 In leap'd the godlike Hero at the breach,
 Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms
 All-dazzling, and he grasp'd two quivering spears.
 Him entering with a leap the gates, no force
 Whate'er of opposition had repress'd,
 Save of the Gods alone. Fire fill'd his eyes;
 Turning, he bade the multitude without
 Ascend the rampart; they his voice obey'd;
 Part climb'd the wall, part pour'd into the gate;
 The Grecians to their hollow galleys flew
 Scatter'd, and tumult infinite arose.[6]
