title: A Grain Of Sand.

 Do you see this grain of sand
 Lying loosely in my hand?
 Do you know to me it brought
 Just a simple loving thought?
 When one gazes night by night
 On the glorious stars of light,
 Oh how little seems the span
 Measured round the life of man.

 Oh! how fleeting are his years
 With their smiles and their tears;
 Can it be that God does care
 For such atoms as we are?
 Then outspake this grain of sand
 "I was fashioned by His hand
 In the star lit realms of space
 I was made to have a place.

 "Should the ocean flood the world,
 Were its mountains 'gainst me hurled
 All the force they could employ
 Wouldn't a single grain destroy;
 And if I, a thing so light,
 Have a place within His sight;
 You are linked unto his throne
 Cannot live nor die alone.


 In the everlasting arms
 Mid life's dangers and alarms
 Let calm trust your spirit fill;
 Know He's God, and then be still."
 Trustingly I raised my head
 Hearing what the atom said;
 Knowing man is greater far
 Than the brightest sun or star.
