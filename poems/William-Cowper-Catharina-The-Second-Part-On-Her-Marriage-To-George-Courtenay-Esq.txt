Believe it or not, as you choose,
The doctrine is certainly true,
That the future is known to the muse,
And poets are oracles too.
I did but express a desire
To see Catharina at home,
At the side of my friend George�s fire,
And lo�she is actually come!


Such prophecy some may despise,
But the wish of a poet and friend
Perhaps is approved in the skies,
And therefore attains to its end.
�Twas a wish that flew ardently forth
From a bosom effectually warm�d
With the talents, the graces, and worth
Of the person for whom it was form�d.


Maria[1] would leave us, I knew,
To the grief and regret of us all,
But less to our grief, could we view
Catharina the Queen of the Hall.
And therefore I wish�d as I did,
And therefore this union of hands:
Not a whisper was heard to forbid,
But all cry�Amen�to the bans.


Since, therefore, I seem to incur
No danger of wishing in vain
When making good wishes for her,
I will e�en to my wishes again�
With one I have made her a wife,
And now I will try with another,
Which I cannot suppress for my life�
How soon I can make her a mother.
