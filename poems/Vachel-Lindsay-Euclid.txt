(Moon Poems for the Children/Fairy-tales for the Children)

 Old Euclid drew a circle
 On a sand-beach long ago.
 He bounded and enclosed it
 With angles thus and so.
 His set of solemn greybeards
 Nodded and argued much
 Of arc and of circumference,
 Diameter and such.
 A silent child stood by them
 From morning until noon
 Because they drew such charming
 Round pictures of the moon.
