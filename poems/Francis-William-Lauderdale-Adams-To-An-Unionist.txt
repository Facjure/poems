 "If you only knew
 How gladly I've given it
 All these years - 
 The light of mine eyes,
 The heat of my lips,
 Mine agonies,
 My yearning tears,
 My blood that drips,
 My brain that sears:
 If you only knew
 How gladly I've given it
 All these years - 
 My hope and my youth,
 My manhood, my Art,
 My passion, my truth,
 My mind and my heart:

 "O my brother, you would not say,
What have you to do with me?
 You would not, would not turn away
Doubtingly and bitterly.

 "If you only knew
 How little I cared for
 These other things - 
 The delicate speech,
 The high demand
 Of each from each,
 The imaginings
 Of Love's Holy Land:
 If you only knew
 How little I cared for
 These other things - 
 The wide clear view
 Over peoples and times,
 The search in the new
 Entrancing climes,
 Science's wings
 And Art's sweet chimes:

 "O my brother, if you only knew
What to me in these things is understood,
 As it seems to me it would seem to you,
What was good for the Cause was surely good:

 "O my brother, you would not say:
What have you to do with me?
 You would not, would not turn away
Doubtingly and bitterly:

 "But you would take my hand with your hand,
O my brother, if you only knew;
 You would smile at me, you would understand,
You would call me brother as I call you!"
