title: On Carthy'S Translation Of Longinus (Epigram Against Carthy)
---

High as Longinus to the stars ascends,
So deeply Carthy to the centre tends.


RATIO INTER LONGINUM ET CARTHIUM COMPUTATA

Aethereas quantum Longinus surgit in auras,
Carthius en tantum ad Tartara tendit iter.


ON THE SAME (Epigram Against Carthy)

What Midas touch'd became true gold, but then,
Gold becomes lead touch'd lightly by thy pen.
