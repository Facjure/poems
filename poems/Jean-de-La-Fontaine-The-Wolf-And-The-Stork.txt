[1]

 The wolves are prone to play the glutton.
 One, at a certain feast, 'tis said,
 So stuff'd himself with lamb and mutton,
 He seem'd but little short of dead.
 Deep in his throat a bone stuck fast.
 Well for this wolf, who could not speak,
 That soon a stork quite near him pass'd.
 By signs invited, with her beak
 The bone she drew
 With slight ado,
 And for this skilful surgery
 Demanded, modestly, her fee.
 'Your fee!' replied the wolf,
 In accents rather gruff;
 'And is it not enough
 Your neck is safe from such a gulf?
 Go, for a wretch ingrate,
 Nor tempt again your fate!'
