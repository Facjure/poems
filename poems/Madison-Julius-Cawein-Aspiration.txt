title: Aspiration.
---

God knows I strive against low lust and vice,
 Wound in the net of their voluptuous hair;
God knows that all their kisses are as ice
 To me who do not care.

God knows, against the front of Fate I set
 Eyes still and stern, and lips as bitter prest;
Raised clenched and ineffectual palms to let
Her rock-like pressing breast!

God knows what motive such large zeal inspires,
 God knows the star for which I climb and crave,
God knows, and only God, the eating fires
 That in my bosom rave.

I will not fall! I will not; thou dost lie!
 Deep Hell! that seethest in thy simmering pit;
Thy thousand throned horrors shall not vie,
 Or ever compass it!

But as thou sinkest from my soul away,
 So shall I rise, rolled in the morning's rose,
Beyond this world, this life, this little day - 
 God knows! God knows! God knows!
