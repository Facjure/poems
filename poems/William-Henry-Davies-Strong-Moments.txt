title: Strong Moments
---

Sometimes I hear fine ladies sing,
 Sometimes I smoke and drink with men;
Sometimes I play at games of cards, 
 Judge me to be no strong man then.

The strongest moment of my life
 Is when I think about the poor;
When, like a spring that rain has fed,
 My pity rises more and more.

The flower that loves the warmth and light,
 Has all its mornings bathed in dew;
My heart has moments wet with tears,
 My weakness is they are so few.
