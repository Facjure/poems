Why have you stolen my delight
 In all the golden shows of Spring
When every cherry-tree is white
 And in the limes the thrushes sing,

O fickler than the April day,
 O brighter than the golden broom,
O blither than the thrushes' lay,
 O whiter than the cherry-bloom,

O sweeter than all things that blow ...
 Why have you only left for me
The broom, the cherry's crown of snow,
 And thrushes in the linden-tree?
