On reading De Quincey's "Confessions of an Opium Eater."


 I seemed to stand before a temple walled
 From shadows and night's unrealities;
 Filled with dark music of dead memories,
 And voices, lost in darkness, aye that called.
 I entered. And, beneath the dome's high-halled
 Immensity, one forced me to my knees
 Before a blackness, throned 'mid semblances
 And spectres, crowned with flames of emerald.
 Then, lo! two shapes that thundered at mine ears
 The names of Horror and Oblivion,
 Priests of this god, and bade me die and dream.
 Then, in the heart of hell, a thousand years
 Meseemed I lay, dead; while the iron stream
 Of Time beat out the seconds, one by one.
