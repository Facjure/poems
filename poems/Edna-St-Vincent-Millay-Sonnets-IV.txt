 Only until this cigarette is ended,
 A little moment at the end of all,
 While on the floor the quiet ashes fall,
 And in the firelight to a lance extended,
 Bizarrely with the jazzing music blended,
 The broken shadow dances on the wall,
 I will permit my memory to recall
 The vision of you, by all my dreams attended.
 And then adieu,--farewell!--the dream is done.
 Yours is a face of which I can forget
 The color and the features, every one,
 The words not ever, and the smiles not yet;
 But in your day this moment is the sun
 Upon a hill, after the sun has set.
