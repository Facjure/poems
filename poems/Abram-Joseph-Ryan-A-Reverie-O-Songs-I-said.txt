title: A Reverie [`"O Songs!" I said:']

"O Songs!" I said:
"Stop sounding in my soul
Just for a little while and let me sleep,
Resting my head on the breast
Of Silence;" but the rhythmic roll
Of a thousand songs swept on and on,
 And a far Voice said:
 "When thou art dead
Thy restless heart shall rest."

And the songs will never let me sleep.
I plead with them; but o'er the deep
They still will roll
 On, and on, and on,
 Their music never gone.
Ah! world-tired soul!
 Just for a little while,
Just like a poor, tired child
 Beneath its Mother's smile --
Only to fall asleep!
Silence! be mother to me!
 But -- No! No! No!
 The waves will ebb and flow.
I wonder is it best
To never, never rest
 Down on the shores of this strange Below?
