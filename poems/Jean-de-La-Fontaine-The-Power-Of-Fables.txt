To M. De Barillon.[1]

 Can diplomatic dignity
 To simple fables condescend?
 Can I your famed benignity
 Invoke, my muse an ear to lend?
 If once she dares a high intent,
 Will you esteem her impudent?
 Your cares are weightier, indeed,
 Than listening to the sage debates
 Of rabbit or of weasel states:
 So, as it pleases, burn or read;
 But save us from the woful harms
 Of Europe roused in hostile arms.
 That from a thousand other places
 Our enemies should show their faces,
 May well be granted with a smile,
 But not that England's Isle
 Our friendly kings should set
 Their fatal blades to whet.
 Comes not the time for Louis to repose?
 What Hercules, against these hydra foes,
 Would not grow weary? Must new heads oppose
 His ever-waxing energy of blows?
 Now, if your gentle, soul-persuasive powers,
 As sweet as mighty in this world of ours,
 Can soften hearts, and lull this war to sleep,[2]
 I'll pile your altars with a hundred sheep;
 And this is not a small affair
 For a Parnassian mountaineer.
 Meantime, (if you have time to spare,)
 Accept a little incense-cheer.
 A homely, but an ardent prayer,
 And tale in verse, I give you here.
 I'll only say, the theme is fit for you.
 With praise, which envy must confess
 To worth like yours is justly due,
 No man on earth needs propping less.

 In Athens, once, that city fickle,
 An orator,[3] awake to feel
 His country in a dangerous pickle,
 Would sway the proud republic's heart,
 Discoursing of the common weal,
 As taught by his tyrannic art.
 The people listen'd - not a word.
 Meanwhile the orator recurr'd
 To bolder tropes - enough to rouse
 The dullest blocks that e'er did drowse;
 He clothed in life the very dead,
 And thunder'd all that could be said.
 The wind received his breath,
 As to the ear of death.
 That beast of many heads and light,[4]
 The crowd, accustom'd to the sound
 Was all intent upon a sight - 
 A brace of lads in mimic fight.
 A new resource the speaker found.
 'Ceres,' in lower tone said he,
 'Went forth her harvest fields to see:
 An eel, as such a fish might he,
 And swallow, were her company.
 A river check'd the travellers three.
 Two cross'd it soon without ado;
 The smooth eel swam, the swallow flew. - '
 Outcried the crowd
 With voices loud - 
 'And Ceres - what did she?'
 'Why, what she pleased; but first
 Yourselves she justly cursed - 
 A people puzzling aye your brains
 With children's tales and children's play,
 While Greece puts on her steel array,
 To save her limbs from, tyrant chains!
 Why ask you not what Philip[5] does?'
 At this reproach the idle buzz
 Fell to the silence of the grave,
 Or moonstruck sea without a wave,
 And every eye and ear awoke
 To drink the words the patriot spoke.
 This feather stick in Fable's cap.
 We're all Athenians, mayhap;
 And I, for one, confess the sin;
 For, while I write this moral here,
 If one should tell that tale so queer
 Ycleped, I think, "The Ass's Skin,"[6]
 I should not mind my work a pin.
 The world is old, they say; I don't deny it; - 
 But, infant still
 In taste and will,
 Whoe'er would teach, must gratify it.
