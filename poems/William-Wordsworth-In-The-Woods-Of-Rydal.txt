 Wild Redbreast! hadst thou at Jemima's lip
 Pecked, as at mine, thus boldly, Love might say,
 A half-blown rose had tempted thee to sip
 Its glistening dews; but hallowed is the clay
 Which the Muse warms; and I, whose head is grey,
 Am not unworthy of thy fellowship;
 Nor could I let one thought, one notion slip
 That might thy sylvan confidence betray.
 For are we not all His without whose care
 Vouchsafed no sparrow falleth to the ground?
 Who gives his Angels wings to speed through air,
 And rolls the planets through the blue profound;
 Then peck or perch, fond Flutterer! nor forbear
 To trust a Poet in still musings bound.
