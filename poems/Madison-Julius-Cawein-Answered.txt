 Do you remember how that night drew on?
 That night of sorrow, when the stars looked wan
 As eyes that gaze reproachful in a dream,
 Loved eyes, long lost, and sadder than the grave?
 How through the heaven stole the moon's gray gleam,
 Like a nun's ghost down a cathedral nave? 
 Do you remember how that night drew on?

 Do you remember the hard words then said?
 Said to the living, now denied the dead, 
 That left me dead, long, long before I died, 
 In heart and spirit? me, your words had slain,
 Telling how love to my poor life had lied,
 Armed with the dagger of a pale disdain. 
 Do you remember the hard words then said?

 Do you remember, now this night draws down
 The threatening heavens, that the lightnings crown
 With wrecks of thunder? when no moon doth give
 The clouds wild witchery? as in a room,
 Behind the sorrowful arras, still may live
 The pallid secret of the haunted gloom. 
 Do you remember, now this night draws down?

 Do you remember, now it comes to pass
 Your form is bowed as is the wind-swept grass?
 And death hath won from you that confidence
 Denied to life? now your sick soul rebels
 Against your pride with tragic eloquence,
 That self-crowned demon of the heart's fierce hells. 
 Do you remember, now it comes to pass?

 Do you remember? Bid your soul be still.
 Here passion hath surrendered unto will,
 And flesh to spirit. Quiet your wild tongue
 And wilder heart. Your kiss is naught to me.
 The instrument love gave you lies unstrung,
 Silent, forsaken of all melody.
 Do you remember? Bid your soul be still.
