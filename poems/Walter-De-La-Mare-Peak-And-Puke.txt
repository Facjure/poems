 From his cradle in the glamourie
 They have stolen my wee brother,
 Roused a changeling in his swaddlings
 For to fret mine own poor mother.
 Pules it in the candle light
 Wi' a cheek so lean and white,
 Chinkling up its eyne so wee,
 Wailing shrill at her an' me.
 It we'll neither rock nor tend
 Till the Silent Silent send,
 Lapping in their waesome arms
 Him they stole with spells and charms,
 Till they take this changeling creature
 Back to its own fairy nature - 
 Cry! Cry! as long as may be,
 Ye shall ne'er be woman's baby!
