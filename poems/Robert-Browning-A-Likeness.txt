Some people hang portraits up
In a room where they dine or sup:
And the wife clinks tea-things under,
And her cousin, he stirs his cup,
Asks �Who was the lady, I wonder?�
��T is a daub John bought at a sale,�
Quoth the wife, looks black as thunder:
�What a shade beneath her nose!
�Snuff-taking, I suppose,�
Adds the cousin, while John�s corns ail.

Or else, there �s no wife in the case,
But the portrait �s queen of the place,
Alone mid the other spoils
Of youth, masks, gloves and foils,
And pipe-sticks, rose, cherry-tree, jasmine,
And the long whip, the tandem-lasher,
And the cast from a fist (�not, alas! mine,
�But my master�s, the Tipton Slasher�),
And the cards where pistol-balls mark ace,
And a satin shoe used for cigar-case,
And the chamois-horns (�shot in the Chablais�)
And prints Rarey drumming on Cruiser,
And Sayers, our champion, the bruiser,
And the little edition of Rabelais:
Where a friend, with both hands in his pockets,
May saunter up close to examine it,
And remark a good deal of Jane Lamb in it,
�But the eyes are half out of their sockets;
�That hair �s not so bad, where the gloss is,
�But they�ve made the girl�s nose a proboscis:
�Jane Lamb, that we danced with at Vichy!
�What, is not she Jane? Then, who is she?�

All that I own is a print,
An etching, a mezzotint;
�T is a study, a fancy, a fiction,
Yet a fact (take my conviction)
Because it has more than a hint
Of a certain face, I never
Saw elsewhere touch or trace of
In women I �ve seen the face of:
Just an etching, and, so far, clever.

I keep my prints, an imbroglio,
Fifty in one portfolio.
When somebody tries my claret,
We turn round chairs to the fire,
Chirp over days in a garret,
Chuckle o�er increase of salary,
Taste the good fruits of our leisure,
Talk about pencil and lyre,
And the National Portrait Gallery:
Then I exhibit my treasure.
After we �ve turned over twenty,
And the debt of wonder my crony owes
Is paid to my Marc Antonios,
He stops me �Festina lent�!
�What�s that sweet thing there, the etching?�
How my waistcoat-strings want stretching,
How my cheeks grow red as tomatos,
How my heart leaps ! But hearts, after leaps, ache.

�By the by, you must take, for a keepsake,
�That other, you praised, of Volpato�s.�
The fool! would he try a flight further and say
He never saw, never before to-day,
What was able to take his breath away,
A face to lose youth for, to occupy age
With the dream of, meet death with, why, I�ll not engage
But that, half in a rapture and half in a rage,
I should toss him the thing�s self ��T is only a duplicate,
�A thing of no value! Take it, I supplicate!�
