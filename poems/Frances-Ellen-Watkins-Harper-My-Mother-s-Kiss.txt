title: My Mother's Kiss.
---

 My mother's kiss, my mother's kiss,
 I feel its impress now;
 As in the bright and happy days
 She pressed it on my brow.

 You say it is a fancied thing
 Within my memory fraught;
 To me it has a sacred place - 
 The treasure house of thought.

 Again, I feel her fingers glide
 Amid my clustering hair;
 I see the love-light in her eyes,
 When all my life was fair.

 Again, I hear her gentle voice
 In warning or in love.
 How precious was the faith that taught
 My soul of things above.

 The music of her voice is stilled,
 Her lips are paled in death.
 As precious pearls I'll clasp her words
 Until my latest breath.

 The world has scattered round my path
 Honor and wealth and fame;
 But naught so precious as the thoughts
 That gather round her name.

 And friends have placed upon my brow
 The laurels of renown;
 But she first taught me how to wear
 My manhood as a crown.

 My hair is silvered o'er with age,
 I'm longing to depart;
 To clasp again my mother's hand,
 And be a child at heart.

 To roam with her the glory-land
 Where saints and angels greet;
 To cast our crowns with songs of love
 At our Redeemer's feet.
