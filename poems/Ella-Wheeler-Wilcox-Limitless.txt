When the motive is right and the will is strong
 There are no limits to human power;
 For that great Force back of us moves along
And takes us with it, in trial's hour.

And whatever the height you yearn to climb,
 Though it never was trod by the foot of man,
 And no matter how steep -I say you CAN,
If you will be patient -and use your time.
