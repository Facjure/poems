title: Her Poem: "My Baby Girl, That Was Born And Died On The Same Day."

 "Ah, with torn heart I see them still,
Wee unused clothes and empty cot.
 Though glad my love has missed the ill
That falls to woman's lot.

 "No tangled paths for her to tread
Throughout the coming changeful years;
 No desperate weird to dree and dread;
No bitter lonely tears!

 "No woman's piercing crown of thorns
Will press my aching baby's brow;
 No starless nights, no sunless morns,
Will ever greet her now.

 "The clothes that I had wrought with care
Through weary hours for love's sweet sake
 Are laid aside, and with them there
A heart that seemed to break."
