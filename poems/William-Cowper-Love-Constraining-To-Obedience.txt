title: Love Constraining To Obedience.
---

No strength of nature can suffice
To serve the Lord aright:
And what she has she misapplies,
For want of clearer light.


How long beneath the law I lay
In bondage and distress!
I toil�d the precept to obey,
But toil�d without success.


Then, to abstain from outward sin
Was more than I could do;
Now, if I feel its power within,
I feel I hate it too.


Then, all my servile works were done
A righteousness to raise;
Now, freely chosen in the Son,
I freely choose his ways.


�What shall I do,� was then the word,
�That I may worthier grow?�
�What shall I render to the Lord?�
Is my inquiry now.


To see the law by Christ fulfill�d,
And hear his pardoning voice,
Changes a slave into a child,[1]
And duty into choice.
