The street was brisk, an animated scene,
 And every man was on some business bent,
 Absorbed in some employment or intent,
Pre-occupied, intelligent and keen.
True, some were dwarf'd and some were pale and lean.
 But to the sorriest visage Labor lent
 A light, transfiguring with her sacrament
The abject countenance and slavish mien.

But one - he shambled aimlessly along
 Asham'd, and shrunk from the abstracted ken
Of passers-by with conscience-struck recoil,
A pariah, a leper in the throng,
 An alien from the commonwealth of men,
A stranger to the covenant of toil.
