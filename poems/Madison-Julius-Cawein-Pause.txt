title: Pause.

 So sick of dreams! the dreams, that stain
 The aisle, along which life must pass,
 With hues of mystic colored glass,
 That fills the windows of the brain.

 So sick of thoughts! the thoughts, that carve
 The house of days with arabesques
 And gargoyles, where the mind grotesques
 In masks of hope and faith who starve.

 Here lay thy over weary head
 Upon my bosom! Do not weep!
 "He giveth His beloved sleep."
 Heart of my heart, be comforted.
