How young I am!Ah! heaven, this curse of youth
 Doth mock me from my mirror with great eyes,
And pulsing veins repeat the unwelcome truth,
 That I must live, though hope within me dies.

So young, and yet I have had all of life.
 Why, men have lived to see a hundred years,
Who have not known the rapture, joy, and strife
 Of my brief youth, its passion and its tears.

Oh! what are years?A ripe three score and ten
 Hold often less of life, in its best sense,
Than just a twelvemonth lived by other men,
 Whose high-strung souls are ardent and intense.

But having seen all depths and scaled all heights,
 Having a heart love thrilled, and sorrow wrung,
Knowing all pains, all pleasures, all delights,
 Now I would die -but cannot, being young.

Nothing is left me, but supreme despair;
 The bitter dregs that tell of wasted wine.
Come furrowed brow, dull eye, and frosted hair,
 Companions fit for this old heart of mine.
