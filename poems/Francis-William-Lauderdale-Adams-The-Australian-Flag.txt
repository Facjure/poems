 Pure blue flag of heaven
With your silver stars,
 Not beside those crosses'
Blood-stained torture-bars:

 Not beside the token
The foul sea-harlot gave,
 Pure blue flag of heaven,
Must you ever wave!

 No, but young exultant,
Free from care and crime,
 The soulless selfish England
Of this later time:

 No, but, faithful, noble,
Rising from her grave,
 Flag of light and liberty,
For ever must you wave!
