title: On The Wall Top.

Dancing and prancing to town we go,
On the top of the wall of the town we go.
Shall we talk to the stars, or talk to the moon,
Or run along home to our dinner so soon?

So high so high on the wall we run,
The nearer the sky why, the nearer the sun,
If you give me one penny, I'll give you two,
For that's the way good neighbours do.
