 Where is the landlord of old Hawk and Buckle,
 And what of Master Straddler this hot summer weather?
 He's along in the tap-room with broad cheeks a-chuckle,
 And ten bold companions all drinking together.

 Where is the daughter of old Hawk and Buckle,
 And what of Mistress Jenny this hot summer weather?
 She sits in the parlour with smell of honeysuckle,
 Trimming her bonnet with red ostrich feather.

 Where is the ostler of old Hawk and Buckle,
 And what of Willy Jakeman this hot summer weather?
 He is rubbing his eyes with a slow and lazy knuckle
 As he wakes from his nap on a bank of fresh heather.

 Where is the page boy of old Hawk and Buckle,
 And what of our young Charlie this hot summer weather?
 He is bobbing for tiddlers in a little trickle-truckle,
 With his line and his hook and his breeches of leather.

 Where is the grey goat of old Hawk and Buckle,
 And what of pretty Nanny this hot summer weather?
 She stays not contented with little or with muckle,
 Straining for daisies at the end of her tether.

 For this is our motto at old Hawk and Buckle,
 We cling to it close and we sing all together,
 "Every man for himself at our old Hawk and Buckle,
 And devil take the hindmost this hot summer weather."
