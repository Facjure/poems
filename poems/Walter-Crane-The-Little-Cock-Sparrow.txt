1

A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
And he chirrupped, he chirrupped so merrily.
He chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped,
He chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped, he chirrupped,
A little cock-sparrow sat on a high tree,
And he chirrupped, he chirrupped so merrily.

2 

A naughty little boy with a bow and arrow,
Determined to shoot this little cock-sparrow;

3 

For this little cock-sparrow would make a nice stew,
And his giblets would make a nice little pie too.

4 

"Oh, no," says cock-sparrow, "I won't make a stew,"
And he fluttered his wings, and away he flew.
