title: Hail!--And Farewell!
---

They died that we might live,--
Hail!--And Farewell!
--All honour give
To those who, nobly striving, nobly fell,
That we might live!

That we might live they died,--
Hail!--And Farewell!
--Their courage tried,
By every mean device of treacherous hate,
Like Kings they died.

Eternal honour give,--
Hail!--And Farewell!--
--To those who died,
In that full splendour of heroic pride,
That we might live!
