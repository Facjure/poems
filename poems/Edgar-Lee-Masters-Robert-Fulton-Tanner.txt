If a man could bite the giant hand
That catches and destroys him,
As I was bitten by a rat
While demonstrating my patent trap,
In my hardware store that day.
But a man can never avenge himself
On the monstrous ogre Life.
You enter the roomthat's being born;
And then you must livework out your soul,
Of the cross-current in life
Which Bring honor to the dead, who lived in shame.
