Lo, as a minstrel at the court of Love,
 The nightingale, who knows his mate is nigh,
Thrills into rapture; and the stars above
 Look down, affrighted, as they would reply.
 There is contagion, and I know not why,
In all this clamour, all this fierce delight,
 As if the sunset, when the day did swoon,
 Had drawn some wild confession from the moon.
Have wrongs been done? Have crimes enacted been
To shame the weird retirement of the night?
 O clamourous bird! O sad; sweet nightingale!
Withhold thy voice, and blame not Beauty's queen.
 She may be pure, though dumb: and she is pale,
And wears a radiance on her brow serene.
