Parable as metaphor - 
profile in hard glint of light,
buckskin garb
merging from shadow &amp;
buckboards - 
sandwiching of memory
being elbowed
thru a Deadwood City
saloon door.

Noneother.
Dead Man's Hand.
Cards strewn,
last tumbler ...
chamber on empty.
Yancy Derringer modelling the
latest revolver of his namesake,
in pit &amp; the palm
bullet in the back
for Wild Bill, just for a keepsake.

Treasure-trove for the funeral parlour:
"they done him up well". Peccadillo as provocation.
