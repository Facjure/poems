"I guess I'll help you, daddy."
 And daddy can't say "No;"
For if he did, 'twould wound you, kid,
 And cause the tears to flow.

"I guess I'll help you, daddy."
 And daddy says: "All right,"
And tries to do, ignoring you,
 Whatever work's in sight.

But what's the use of trying?
 As well be reconciled
To quit and play the game that may
 Be pleasing to you, child.

To quit and play, or roughhouse,
 Or read, as you elect;
For I'm afraid the guess you made
 Was wholly incorrect.
