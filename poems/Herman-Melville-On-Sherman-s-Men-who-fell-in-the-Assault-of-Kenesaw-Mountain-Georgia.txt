title: On Sherman's Men who fell in the Assault of Kenesaw Mountain, Georgia.
---

 They said that Fame her clarion dropped
 Because great deeds were done no more - 
 That even Duty knew no shining ends,
 And Glory - 'twas a fallen star!
 But battle can heroes and bards restore.
 Nay, look at Kenesaw:
 Perils the mailed ones never knew
 Are lightly braved by the ragged coats of blue,
 And gentler hearts are bared to deadlier war.
