 For the mountains' hoarse greetings came hollow
From stormy wind-chasms and caves,
 And I heard their wild cataracts wallow
Huge bulks in long spasms of waves,
 And that Demon said, "Lo! you must follow!
And our path is o'er myriads of graves."

 Then I felt that the black earth was porous
And rotten with worms and with bones;
 And I knew that the ground that now bore us
Was cadaverous with Death's skeletons;
 And I saw horrid eyes, heard sonorous
And dolorous gnashings and groans.

 But the night of the tempest and thunder,
The might of the terrible skies,
 And the fire of Hell that, - coiled under
The hollow Earth, - smoulders and sighs,
 And the laughter of stars and their wonder
Mingled and mixed in its eyes.

 And we clomb - and the moon old and sterile
Clomb with us o'er torrent and scar!
 And I yearned towards her oceans of beryl,
Wan mountains and cities of spar - 
 "'Tis not well," that one said, "you're in peril
Of falling and failing your star."

 And we clomb - through a murmur of pinions,
Thin rattle of talons and plumes;
 And a sense as of Boreal dominions
Clove down to the abysms and tombs;
 And the Night's naked, Ethiope minions
Swarmed on us in legions of glooms.

 And we clomb - till we stood at the portal
Of the uttermost point of the peak,
 And it led with a step more than mortal
Far upward some presence to seek;
 And I felt that this love was immortal,
This love which had made me so weak.

 We had clomb till the limbo of spirits
Of darkness and crime deep below
 Swung nebular; nor could we hear its
Lost wailings and moanings of woe, - 
 For we stood in a realm that inherits
A vanquishing virgin of snow.
