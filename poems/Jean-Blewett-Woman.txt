title: Woman.

Not faultless, for she was not fashioned so,
 A mingling of the bitter and the sweet;
Lips that can laugh and sigh and whisper low
 Of hope and trust and happiness complete,
Or speak harsh truths; eyes that can flash with fire,
 Or make themselves but wells of tenderness
Wherein is drowned all bitterness and ire - 
 Warm eyes whose lightest glance is a caress.
Heaven sent her here to brighten this old earth,
 And only heaven fully knows her worth.
