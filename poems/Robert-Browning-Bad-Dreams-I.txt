Last night I saw you in my sleep:
And how your charm of face was changed!
I asked, �Some love, some faith you keep?�
You answered, �Faith gone, love estranged.�

Whereat I woke, a twofold bliss:
Waking was one, but next there came
This other: �Though I felt, for this,
My heart break, I loved on the same.�
