[To M.]


 With brilliant friends surrounding me,
So cosy at the Club I'm sitting;
 While you at home I seem to see,
Attending strictly to your knitting.

 When women have their rights, my dear,
We'll hear no more of wrongs so shocking: - 
 You with your friends shall gather here;
I'll stay at home and darn the stocking!
