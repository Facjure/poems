(See Note 67)

I honor you, who, though refused, affronted,
 Have heard the voice, and victory have won;
I honor you, who still by malice hunted,
 Show miracles of faith and power done.

I honor you, God-thirsting soul so driven,
 'Mid scorn and need the spirit's war to wage;
I honor you, by Gudbrand's valley given,
 And of her sons the foremost in this age.

I do not share your faith, your daring dreaming;
 This parts us not, the spirit's paths are broad.
For, all things great and noble round us streaming,
 I worship them, because I worship God.
