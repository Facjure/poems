Affections, Instincts, Principles, and Powers,
Impulse and Reason, Freedom and Control
So men, unravelling God�s harmonious whole.
Rend in a thousand shreds this life of ours.
Vain labour! Deep and broad, where none may see,
Spring the foundations of the shadowy throne
Where man�s one Nature, queen-like, sits alone,
Centred in a majestic unity;
And rays her powers, like sister islands, seen
Linking their coral arms under the sea:
Or cluster�d peaks, with plunging gulfs between
Spann�d by a�rial arches, all of gold;
Whereo�er the chariot wheels of Life are roll�d
In cloudy circles, to eternity
