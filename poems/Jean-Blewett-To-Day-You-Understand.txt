title: To-Day You Understand.
---

You lifted eyes pain-filled to me,
 Sad, questioning eyes that did demand
Why I should thrust back, childishly,
The friendship warm you offered me - 
 Ah, sweet, to-day you understand!

'Twas that my heart beat rapturously
 At word of thine, at touch of hand,
At tender glance vouchsafed to me
The while I knew it must not be - 
 Ah, sweet, to-day you understand!

There's neither pain nor mystery
 In that far-off and fragrant land
To which you journeyed fearlessly;
By gates of pearl and jasper sea - 
 Ah, sweet, to-day you understand!
