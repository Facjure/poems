title: Rocky Acres.

 This is a wild land, country of my choice,
 With harsh craggy mountain, moor ample and bare.
 Seldom in these acres is heard any voice
 But voice of cold water that runs here and there
 Through rocks and lank heather growing without care.
 No mice in the heath run nor no birds cry
 For fear of the dark speck that floats in the sky.

 He soars and he hovers rocking on his wings,
 He scans his wide parish with a sharp eye,
 He catches the trembling of small hidden things,
 He tears them in pieces, dropping from the sky:
 Tenderness and pity the land will deny,
 Where life is but nourished from water and rock
 A hardy adventure, full of fear and shock.

 Time has never journeyed to this lost land,
 Crakeberries and heather bloom out of date,
 The rocks jut, the streams flow singing on either hand,
 Careless if the season be early or late.
 The skies wander overhead, now blue, now slate:
 Winter would be known by his cold cutting snow
 If June did not borrow his armour also.

 Yet this is my country be loved by me best,
 The first land that rose from Chaos and the Flood,
 Nursing no fat valleys for comfort and rest,
 Trampled by no hard hooves, stained with no blood.
 Bold immortal country whose hill tops have stood
 Strongholds for the proud gods when on earth they go,
 Terror for fat burghers in far plains below.
