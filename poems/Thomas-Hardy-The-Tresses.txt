 "When the air was damp
It made my curls hang slack
As they kissed my neck and back
While I footed the salt-aired track
 I loved to tramp.

 "When it was dry
They would roll up crisp and tight
As I went on in the light
Of the sun, which my own sprite
 Seemed to outvie.

 "Now I am old;
And have not one gay curl
As I had when a girl
For dampness to unfurl
 Or sun uphold!"
