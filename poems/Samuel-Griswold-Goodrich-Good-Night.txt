The sun has sunk behind the hills,
 The shadows o'er the landscape creep;
A drowsy sound the woodland fills,
 And nature folds her arms to sleep:
 Good night good night.

The chattering jay has ceased his din 
 The noisy robin sings no more 
The crow, his mountain haunt within,
 Dreams 'mid the forest's surly roar:
 Good night good night.

The sunlit cloud floats dim and pale;
 The dew is falling soft and still;
The mist hangs trembling o'er the vale,
 And silence broods o'er yonder mill:
 Goodnight good night.

The rose, so ruddy in the light,
 Bends on its stem all rayless now,
And by its side the lily white
 A sister shadow, seems to bow:
 Good night good night.

The bat may wheel on silent wing 
 The fox his guilty vigils keep 
The boding owl his dirges sing;
 But love and innocence will sleep:
 Good night good night!
