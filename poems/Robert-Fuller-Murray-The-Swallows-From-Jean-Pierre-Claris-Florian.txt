title: The Swallows. From Jean Pierre Claris Florian

I love to see the swallows come
 At my window twittering,
Bringing from their southern home
 News of the approaching spring.
'Last year's nest,' they softly say,
 'Last year's love again shall see;
Only faithful lovers may
 Tell you of the coming glee.'

When the first fell touch of frost
 Strips the wood of faded leaves,
Calling all their winged host,
 The swallows meet above the eaves
 'Come away, away,' they cry,
 'Winter's snow is hastening;
True hearts winter comes not nigh,
 They are ever in the spring.'

If by some unhappy fate,
 Victim of a cruel mind,
One is parted from her mate
 And within a cage confined,
Swiftly will the swallow die,
 Pining for her lover's bower,
And her lover watching nigh
 Dies beside her in an hour.
