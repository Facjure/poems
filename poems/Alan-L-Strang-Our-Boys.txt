 Written after the United States entered the war, fighting on the side of the Entente Allies.


Halt! Attention! Salute the flag,
The boys are marching by;
They're going forth to win the war
For us to do or die.
Our country needed fighting men,
Her liberty to save;
These boys responded to the call,
And all they had they gave.

All loyal hearts are beating fast,
And hope our bosoms fill;
For liberty shall reign supreme
O'er ocean, dale and hill.
With no regrets for parted hopes
Or futures cast aside,
Our soldier boys are marching by;
They are our country's pride.
