 I.

Ai me! why stood I on the bent
 When Summer wept o'er dying June!
I saw the Fairy Folk ride faint
 Aneath the moon.


 II.

The haw-trees hedged the russet lea
 Where cuckoo-buds waxed rich with gold;
The wealthy corn rose yellowly
 Endlong the wold.


 III.

Betwixt the haw-trees and the mead
 "The Fairy Rade" came glimmering on;
A creamy cavalcade did speed
 O'er the green lawn.


 IV.

The night was ringing with their reins;
 Loud laughed they till the cricket hushed;
The whistles on their coursers' manes
 Shrill music gushed.


 V.

The whistles tagged their horses' manes
 All crystal clear; on these a wind
Forever played, and waked the plains
 Before, behind.


 VI.

These flute-notes and the Fairy song
 Took the dim holts with many a qualm,
And eke their silver bridles rung
 A far-off psalm.


 VII.

All rid upon pale ouphen steeds
 With flying tails, uncouthly seen;
Each wore a scarf athwart his weeds
 Of freshest green.


 VIII.

And aye a beam of silver light
 Fairer than moonshine danced aboon,
And shook their locks - a glimmering white
 Not of the moon.


 IX.

Small were they that the hare-bell's blue
 Had helmeted each tiny head;
Save one damsel, who, tall as two,
 The Faeries led.


 X.

Long tresses floated from a tire
 Of diamond sparks, which cast a light,
And o'er her white sark shook, in fire
 Rippling the night.


 XI.

I would have thrown me 'neath her feet,
 And told her all my dole and pain,
There while her rein was jingling sweet
 O'er all the plain.


 XII.

Alas! a black and thwarting cock
 Crew from the thatch with long-necked cry - 
The Elfin queen and her wee flock
 In the night did die.
