Not your martyrs anointed of heaven - 
 The ages are red where they trod - 
But the Hunted - the world's bitter leaven - 
 Who smote at your imbecile God - 

A being to pander and fawn to,
 To propitiate, flatter and dread
As a thing that your souls are in pawn to,
 A Dealer who traffics the dead;

A Trader with greed never sated,
 Who barters the souls in his snares,
That were trapped in the lusts he created,
 For incense and masses and prayers - 

They are crushed in the coils of your halters;
 'Twere well - by the creeds ye have nursed - 
That ye send up a cry from your altars,
 A mass for the Martyrs Accursed;

A passionate prayer from reprieval
 For the Brotherhood not understood - 
For the Heroes who died for the evil,
 Believing the evil was good.

To the Breakers, the Bold, the Despoilers,
 Who dreamed of a world over-thrown...
They who died for the millions of toilers - 
 Few - fronting the nations alone!

 - To the Outlawed of men and the Branded,
 Whether hated or hating they fell - 
I pledge the devoted, red-handed,
 Unfaltering Heroes of Hell!
