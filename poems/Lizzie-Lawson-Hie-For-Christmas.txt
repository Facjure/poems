title: Hie For Christmas!
---

Bring Frost, bring Snow,
Come winter,
Bring us holly,
Bring joy at Christmas,
Off with Melancholy!

Sing hie, sing hey,
Sing ho,
Sing holly,
Sing hie for Christmas!
Isn't winter jolly?

Sing Jack, Sing Jill,
Sing Jo,
Sing Polly,
Sing hie for Christmas,
Mistletoe and Holly.
