title: Hymn For Music, After The Battle Of Waterloo.
---

 Perish! Almighty Justice cried,
And struck the avenging blow,
 And Europe shouts from side to side,
The tyrant is laid low!
 Said not his heart, More blood shall stream
Around my sovereign throne?
 He wakes from dire ambition's dream,
Pale, trembling, and alone.

ARIA WITH CHORUS.

 Triumph! the rescued nations cry,
 Triumph! ten thousand hearts reply.

 Sad mother, weep no more thy children slain;
The trumpets and the battle clangours cease:
 Uplift to heaven the loud, the grateful strain,
And hail the dawn of Freedom and of Peace.

CHORUS.

 Triumph! the rescued nations cry,
 Triumph! ten thousand hearts reply.

ARIA.

 For joy returned, for peace restored,
Lord of all worlds, to thee we raise,
 While Slaughter drops his weary sword,
To thee the hymn of gratitude and praise.

CHORUS.

 Triumph! the rescued nations cry,
 Triumph! ten thousand hearts reply.
