Dedication Poem on the reception of the annex to the home for aged colored people, from the bequest of Mr. Edward T. Parker.

 Outcast from her home in Syria
 In the lonely, dreary wild;
 Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken,
 Sat a mother and her child.

 There was not a voice to cheer her
 Not a soul to share her fate;
 She was weary, he was fainting,
 And life seemed so desolate.

 Far away in sunny Egypt
 Was lone Hagar's native land;
 Where the Nile in kingly bounty
 Scatters bread with gracious hand.

 In the tents of princely Abram
 She for years had found a home;
 Till the stern decree of Sarah
 Sent her forth the wild to roam.

 Hour by hour she journeyed onward
 From the shelter of their tent,
 Till her footsteps slowly faltered
 And the water all was spent;

 Then she veiled her face in sorrow,
 Feared her child would die of thirst
 Till her eyes with tears so holden
 Saw a sparkling fountain burst.

 Oh! how happy was that mother,
 What a soothing of her pain;
 When she saw her child reviving,
 Life rejoicing through each vein

 Does not life repeat this story,
 Tell it over day by day?
 Of the fountains of refreshment
 Ever springing by our way.

 Here is one by which we gather,
 On this bright and happy day,
 Just to bask beside a fountain
 Making gladder life's highway.

 Bringing unto hearts now aged
 Who have borne life's burdens long,
 Such a gift of love and mercy
 As deserves our sweetest song.

 Such a gift that even heaven
 May rejoice with us below,
 If the pure and holy angels
 Join us in our joy and woe.

 May the memory of the giver
 In this home where age may rest,
 Float like fragrance through the ages,
 Ever blessing, ever blest.

 When the gates of pearl are opened
 May we there this friend behold,
 Drink with him from living fountains,
 Walk with him the streets of gold.

 When life's shattered cords of music
 Shall again be sweetly sung;
 Then our hearts with life immortal,
 Shall be young, forever young.
