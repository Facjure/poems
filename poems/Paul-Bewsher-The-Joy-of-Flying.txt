title: The Joy of Flying

When heavy on my tired mind
 The world, and worldly things, do weigh,
And some sweet solace I would find,
 Into the sky I love to stray,
And, all alone, to wander round
In lone seclusion from the ground.

Ah! Then what solitude is mine - 
 From grovelling mankind aloof!
Their road is but a thin-drawn line:
 Their busy house a scarce-seen roof.
That little stain of red and brown
They boast about! - It is their town!

How small their petty quarrels seem!
 Poor, crawling multitudes below;
Which, like the ants, in feverish stream
 From place to place move to and fro!
Like ants they work: like ants they fight,
Assuming blindly they are right.

Soon their existence I forget,
 In joy that on these flashing wings
I cleave the skies - O! let them fret - 
 Now know I why the skylark sings
Untrammelled in the boundless air - 
For mine it is his bliss to share!

Now do I mount a billowy cloud,
 Now do I sail low o'er a hill,
And with a seagull's skill endowed
 Circle, and wheel, and drop at will - 
Above the villages asleep,
Above the valleys, shadowed deep,

Above the water-meadows green
 Whose streams, which intermingled flow,
Like silver lattice-work are seen
 A-gleam upon the plain below - 
Above the woods, whose naked trees
Move new-born buds upon the breeze.

And far away above the haze
 I see white mountain-summits rise,
Whose snow with sunlight is ablaze
 And shines against the distant skies.
Such thoughts those towering ranges bring
That I float on a-wondering!

So do I love to travel on
 Through lonely skies, myself alone;
For then the feverish fret is gone
 Which on this earth I oft have known.
Kind is the God who lets me fly
In sweet seclusion through the sky!

 France, 1917.
