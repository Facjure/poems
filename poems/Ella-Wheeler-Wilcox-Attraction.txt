 The meadow and the mountain with desire
 Gazed on each other, till a fierce unrest
 Surged 'neath the meadow's seemingly calm breast,
 And all the mountain's fissures ran with fire.

 A mighty river rolled between them there.
 What could the mountain do but gaze and burn?
 What could the meadow do but look and yearn,
 And gem its bosom to conceal despair?

 Their seething passion agitated space,
 Till, lo! the lands a sudden earthquake shook,
 The river fled, the meadow leaped and took
 The leaning mountain in a close embrace.
