title: Stand by the Engines
---

On the moonlighted decks there are children at play,
While smoothly the steamer is holding her way;
And the old folks are chatting on deck-seats and chairs,
And the lads and the lassies go strolling in pairs.

Some gaze half-entranced on the beautiful sea,
And wonder perhaps if a vision it be:
And surely there journeys no sorrow nor care,
For wealth, love, and beauty are passengers there.

But down underneath, �mid the coal dust that smears
The face and the hands, work the ship�s engineers.
Whate�er be the duty of others, �tis theirs
To stand by their engines whatever occurs.

The sailor may gaze on the sea and the sky;
The sailor may tell when the danger is nigh;
But when Death his black head o�er the waters uprears,
Unseen he is met by the ship�s engineers.

They are thrown from their feet by the force of a shock;
They know that their vessel has struck on a rock.
Now stand by your engines when danger appears,
For all may depend on the ship�s engineers!

No thought of their danger! No mad rush on deck!
They stand at their posts in the hull of a wreck,
Firm hands on the valves; and the white steam appears;
And down with their ship go the brave engineers!
