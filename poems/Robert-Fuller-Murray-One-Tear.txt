Last night, when at parting
 Awhile we did stand,
Suddenly starting,
 There fell on my hand

Something that burned it,
 Something that shone
In the moon as I turned it,
 And then it was gone.

One bright stray jewel--
 What made it stray?
Was I cold or cruel,
 At the close of day?

Oh, do not cry, lass!
 What is crying worth?
There is no lass like my lass
 In the whole wide earth.
