 (April, 1862.)


 When Israel camped by Migdol hoar,
 Down at her feet her shawm she threw,
 But Moses sung and timbrels rung
 For Pharaoh's standed crew.
 So God appears in apt events - 
 The Lord is a man of war!
 So the strong wind to the muse is given
 In victory's roar.

 Deep be the ode that hymns the fleet - 
 The fight by night - the fray
 Which bore our Flag against the powerful stream,
 And led it up to day.
 Dully through din of larger strife
 Shall bay that warring gun;
 But none the less to us who live
 It peals - an echoing one.

 The shock of ships, the jar of walls,
 The rush through thick and thin - 
 The flaring fire-rafts, glare and gloom - 
 Eddies, and shells that spin - 
 The boom-chain burst, the hulks dislodged,
 The jam of gun-boats driven,
 Or fired, or sunk - made up a war
 Like Michael's waged with leven.

 The manned Varuna stemmed and quelled
 The odds which hard beset;
 The oaken flag-ship, half ablaze,
 Passed on and thundered yet;
 While foundering, gloomed in grimy flame,
 The Ram Manassas - hark the yell! - 
 Plunged, and was gone; in joy or fright,
 The River gave a startled swell.

 They fought through lurid dark till dawn;
 The war-smoke rolled away
 With clouds of night, and showed the fleet
 In scarred yet firm array,
 Above the forts, above the drift
 Of wrecks which strife had made;
 And Farragut sailed up to the town
 And anchored - sheathed the blade.

 The moody broadsides, brooding deep,
 Hold the lewd mob at bay,
 While o'er the armed decks' solemn aisles
 The meek church-pennons play;
 By shotted guns the sailors stand,
 With foreheads bound or bare;
 The captains and the conquering crews
 Humble their pride in prayer.

 They pray; and after victory, prayer
 Is meet for men who mourn their slain;
 The living shall unmoor and sail,
 But Death's dark anchor secret deeps detain.
 Yet glory slants her shaft of rays
 Far through the undisturbed abyss;
 There must be other, nobler worlds for them
 Who nobly yield their lives in this.
