Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
 Across green fields, the blue green sea,
You knew the little weary feet
 Of my child bride that was to be!

Her people brought her from the shore
 One golden day in sultry June,
And I stood, waiting, at the door,
 Praying my eyes might see her soon.

With eager arms, wide open thrown,
 Now never to be satisfied!
Ere I could make my love my own
 She closed her amber eyes and died.

Alas! alas! they took no heed
 How frail she was, my little one,
But brought her here with cruel speed
 Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.

We laid her on the marriage bed
 The bridal flowers in her hand,
A maiden from the ocean led
 Only, alas! to die inland.

I walk alone; the air is sweet,
 The white road wanders to the sea,
I dream of those two little feet
 That grew so tired in reaching me.
