Little cullud Rastus come a-skippin� down de street,
A-smilin� and a-grinnin� at every one he meet;
My, oh! He was happy! Boy, but was he gay!
Wishin� �Merry Chris�mus� an� �Happy New-Year�s Day�!
Wishin� that his wishes might every one come true,
And, bless your dear heart, honey, I wish the same to you!
