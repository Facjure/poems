No gift I bring but worship, and the love
 Which all must bear to lovely souls and pure,
 Those lights, that, when all else is dark, endure;
Stars in the night, to lift our eyes above;

To lift our eyes and hearts, and make us move
 Less doubtful, though our journey be obscure,
 Less fearful of its ending, being sure
That they watch over us, where'er we rove.

And though my gift itself have little worth,
 Yet worth it gains from her to whom 'tis given,
As a weak flower gets colour from the sun.
Or rather, as when angels walk the earth,
 All things they look on take the look of heaven--
For of those blessed angels thou art one.
