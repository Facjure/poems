Brain Engravings.


Great wonder is the human brain,
How it impressions doth retain,
Inscribed on it are autographs,
And there is also photographs.

And every hill and plain and nook,
It is deep graven in this book,
A great variety here belongs,
Snatches of sermons and of songs.

Here you'll find are numerous themes,
Both mighty thoughts and foolish dreams,
Here love and hope so bright and fair,
There hate and doubt and dark despair.

And here is too the bower of bliss,
Where youthful lovers first did kiss,
Here are memories of childhood
And of old ages thoughtful mood.

View well the whole, 'tis a strange sight,
Both of suffering and delight,
You see the parting with old friend,
And where new hearts with yours do blend.

Greatest blessing, hope of heaven,
For our comfort it is given,
Indented deep in mind of wise
Are glories of the heavenly prize.
