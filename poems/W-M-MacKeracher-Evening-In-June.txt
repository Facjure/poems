title: Evening In June.

The purple lilac with the dark green leaves
 A subtle perfume spreads o'er fields wherein
The meadow-lark with clear full singing cleaves
 The choral air. The rossignols begin
 A blither song, where the treacherous spiders spin
Their shimmering webs. The robin o'er her young
 Chirps cheerfully, or starts the frighted din.
Till the night oriole lights his lamp among
The blooms of marigold and spotted adder's tongue.
