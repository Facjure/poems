I

 With nodding plumes, and lightly drest
 Like foresters in leaf-green vest,
 The Helvetian Mountaineers, on ground
 For Tell's dread archery renowned,
 Before the target stood, to claim
 The guerdon of the steadiest aim.
 Loud was the rifle-gun's report
 A startling thunder quick and short!
 But, flying through the heights around,
 Echo prolonged a tell-tale sound
 Of hearts and hands alike "prepared
 The treasures they enjoy to guard!"
 And, if there be a favoured hour
 When Heroes are allowed to quit
 The tomb, and on the clouds to sit
 With tutelary power,
 On their Descendants shedding grace
 This was the hour, and that the place.

II

 But Truth inspired the Bards of old
 When of an iron age they told,
 Which to unequal laws gave birth,
 And drove Astraea from the earth.
 A gentle Boy (perchance with blood
 As noble as the best endued,
 But seemingly a Thing despised;
 Even by the sun and air unprized;
 For not a tinge or flowery streak
 Appeared upon his tender cheek)
 Heart-deaf to those rebounding notes,
 Apart, beside his silent goats,
 Sate watching in a forest shed,
 Pale, ragged, with bare feet and head;
 Mute as the snow upon the hill,
 And, as the saint he prays to, still.
 Ah, what avails heroic deed?
 What liberty? if no defense
 Be won for feeble Innocence.
 Father of all! though willful Manhood read
 His punishment in soul-distress,
 Grant to the morn of life its natural blessedness!
