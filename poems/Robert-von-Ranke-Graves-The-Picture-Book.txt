 When I was not quite five years old
 I first saw the blue picture book,
 And Fraulein Spitzenburger told
 Stories that sent me hot and cold;
 I loathed it, yet I had to look:
 It was a German book.

 I smiled at first, for she'd begun
 With a back-garden broad and green,
 And rabbits nibbling there:page one
 Turned; and the gardener fired his gun
 From the low hedge:he lay unseen
 Behind:oh, it was mean!

 They're hurt, they can't escape, and so
 He stuffs them head-down in a sack,
 Not quite dead, wriggling in a row,
 And Fraulein laughed, "Ho, ho!Ho, ho!"
 And gave my middle a hard smack,
 I wish that I'd hit back.

 Then when I cried she laughed again;
 On the next page was a dead boy
 Murdered by robbers in a lane;
 His clothes were red with a big stain
 Of blood, he held a broken toy,
 The poor, poor little boy!

 I had to look:there was a town
 Burning where every one got caught,
 Then a fish pulled a nigger down
 Into the lake and made him drown,
 And a man killed his friend; they fought
 For money, Fraulein thought.

 Old Fraulein laughed, a horrid noise.
 "Ho, ho!"Then she explained it all
 How robbers kill the little boys
 And torture them and break their toys.
 Robbers are always big and tall:
 I cried:I was so small.

 How a man often kills his wife,
 How every one dies in the end
 By fire, or water or a knife.
 If you're not careful in this life,
 Even if you can trust your friend,
 You won't have long to spend.

 I hated it, old Fraulein picked
 Her teeth, slowly explaining it.
 I had to listen, Fraulein licked
 Her fingers several times and flicked
 The pages over; in a fit
 Of rage I spat at it...

 And lying in my bed that night
 Hungry, tired out with sobs, I found
 A stretch of barren years in sight,
 Where right is wrong, but strength is right,
 Where weak things must creep underground,
 And I could not sleep sound.
