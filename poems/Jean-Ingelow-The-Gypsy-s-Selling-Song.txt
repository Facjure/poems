My good man - he's an old, old man - 
And my good man got a fall,
To buy me a bargain so fast he ran
When he heard the gypsies call:
 "Buy, buy brushes,
 Baskets wrought o' rushes.
 Buy them, buy them, take them, try them,
Buy, dames all."

My old man, he has money and land,
And a young, young wife am I.
Let him put the penny in my white hand
When he hears the gypsies cry:
 "Buy, buy laces,
 Veils to screen your faces.
 Buy them, buy them, take and try them.
Buy, maids, buy."
