The wind makes moan, the water runneth chill;
 I hear the nymphs go crying through the brake;
And roaming mournfully from hill to hill
 The maenads all are silent for his sake!

He loved thy pipe, O wreathed and piping Pan!
 So play'st thou sadly, lone within thine hollow;
He was thy blood, if ever mortal man,
 Therefore thou weepest - even thou, Apollo!

But O, the grieving of the Little Things,
 Above the pipe and lyre, throughout the woods!
The beating of a thousand airy wings,
 The cry of all the fragile multitudes!

The moth flits desolate, the tree-toad calls,
 Telling the sorrow of the elf and fay;
The cricket, little harper of the walls,
 Puts up his harp - hath quite forgot to play!

And risen on these winter paths anew,
 The wilding blossoms make a tender sound;
The purple weed, the morning-glory blue,
 And all the timid darlings of the ground!

Here, here the pain is sharpest! For he walked
 As one of these - and they knew naught of fear,
But told him daily happenings and talked
 Their lovely secrets in his list'ning ear!

Yet we do bid them grieve, and tell their grief;
 Else were they thankless, else were all untrue;
O wind and stream, O bee and bird and leaf,
 Mourn for your poet, with a long adieu!
