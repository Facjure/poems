The most appropriate comment,
besides pig knuckles on racks
&amp; rabbits skewered on prongs
or the Chinese lettering
playing tricks with your Occidental eyes,
is the Breakfast at Tiffany's
approach to suffering - 
that ambience of egg rolls
&amp; fortune cookies dashed aside with
mild dosages of rose-petal tea
amid such trappings and parodies
of the human experiment left stammering
in the too crowded sun
