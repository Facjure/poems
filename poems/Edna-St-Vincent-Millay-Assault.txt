 I

 I had forgotten how the frogs must sound
 After a year of silence, else I think
 I should not so have ventured forth alone
 At dusk upon this unfrequented road.


 II

 I am waylaid by Beauty.Who will walk
 Between me and the crying of the frogs?
 Oh, savage Beauty, suffer me to pass,
 That am a timid woman, on her way
 From one house to another!
