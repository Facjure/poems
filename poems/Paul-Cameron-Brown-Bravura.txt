Memory as embankment,
a mudslide at High Tide
with shades up...
my avocado green brethren
pleasures the soil.

Memory as enchantment
a Belle at a Soiree,
pureed, Gaston at a Dinner Party.

Napanee suggests sympathy,
a serendipity...
as water winders its way
to clay in a moonlight
turn of the bottle,
I shall find a way.
that's ironclad.
