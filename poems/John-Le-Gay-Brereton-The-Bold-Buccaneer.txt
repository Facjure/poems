One very rough day on the Pride of the Fray
In the scuppers a poor little cabin-boy lay,
When the Bosun drew nigh with wrath in his eye
And gave him a kick to remember him by,
As he cried with a sneer: �What good are you here?
Go home to your mammy, my bold buccaneer.�

Now the Captain beheld, and his pity upwelled:
With a plug in the peeper the Bosun he felled.
With humility grand he extended his hand
And helped the poor lad, who was weeping, to stand,
As he cried: �Have no fear; I�m the manager here.
Take heart, and you�ll yet be a bold buccaneer.�

But how he did flare when the lad then and there
Doffed his cap and shook down a gold banner of hair.
Though his movements were shy, he�d a laugh in his eye,
And he sank on the Captain�s broad breast with a sigh,
As he cried: �Is it queer that I�ve followed you here?
I�m your sweetheart from Bristol, my bold buccaneer.�

On an isle in the west, by the breezes caressed,
The bold buccaneer has a warm little nest,
And he sits there in state amid pieces of eight
And tackles his rum with a manner elate,
As he cries: �O my dear little cabin-boy, here
Is a toast to the babe of the bold buccaneer!�
