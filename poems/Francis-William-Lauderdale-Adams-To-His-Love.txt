 "Teach me, love, to be true;
Teach me, love, to love;
 Teach me to be pure like you.
It will be more than enough!

 "Ah, and in days to come,
Give me, my seraph, too,
 A son nobler than I,
A daughter true like you:

 "A son to battle the wrong,
To seek and strive for the right;
 A beautiful daughter of song,
To point us on to the light!"
