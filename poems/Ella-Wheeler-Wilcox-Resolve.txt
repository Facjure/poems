title: Resolve.
---

 Build on resolve, and not upon regret,
 The structure of thy future. Do not grope
 Among the shadows of old sins, but let
 Thine own soul's light shine on the path of hope
 And dissipate the darkness. Waste no tears
 Upon the blotted record of lost years,
 But turn the leaf and smile, oh, smile, to see
 The fair white pages that remain for thee.

 Prate not of thy repentance. But believe
 The spark divine dwells in thee: let it grow.
 That which the upreaching spirit can achieve
 The grand and all-creative forces know;
 They will assist and strengthen as the light
 Lifts up the acorn to the oak tree's height.
 Thou hast but to resolve, and lo! God's whole
 Great universe shall fortify thy soul.
