 This is the face of her
 I've dreamed of long;
 Here in my heart's despair,
 This is the face of her
 Pictured in song.

 Look on the lily lids,
 The eyes of dawn,
 Deep as a Nereid's,
 Swimming with dewy lids
 In waters wan.

 Look on the brows of snow,
 The locks brown-bright;
 Only young sleep can show
 Such brows of placid snow,
 Such locks of night.

 The cheeks, like rosy moons,
 The lips of fire;
 Love thinks no sweeter tunes
 Under enchanted moons
 Than their desire.

 Loved lips and eyes and hair,
 Lo, this is she!
 She, who sits smiling there
 Over my heart's despair,
 Never for me!
