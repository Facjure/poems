"Whenever you dress me dolls, mammy,
 Why do you dress them so,
And make them gallant soldiers,
 When never a one I know;
And not as gentle ladies
 With frills and frocks and curls,
As people dress the dollies
 Of other little girls?"

Ah - why did she not answer:-
 "Because your mammy's heed
Is always gallant soldiers,
 As well may be, indeed.
One of them was your daddy,
 His name I must not tell;
He's not the dad who lives here,
 But one I love too well."
