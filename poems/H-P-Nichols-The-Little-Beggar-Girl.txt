I've just looked from the window
To see the snow come down,
And make the streets look nice and white,
That lately were so brown.

I've seen a little beggar-girl
Go by in all the cold;
She had no shoes nor stockings on,
Her dress was torn and old.

How thankful I should be to God,
Who gives me clothes and food,
A nice warm fire, a pleasant home,
And parents kind and good!

Mamma, I'll always try to help
The hungry and the poor;
For those who are not warmed and fed,
I pity, I am sure.
