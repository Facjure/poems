title: To Mary Pickford - Moving-picture Actress

(On hearing she was leaving the moving-pictures for the stage.)



 Mary Pickford, doll divine,
 Year by year, and every day
 At the moving-picture play,
 You have been my valentine.

 Once a free-limbed page in hose,
 Baby-Rosalind in flower,
 Cloakless, shrinking, in that hour
 How our reverent passion rose,
 How our fine desire you won.
 Kitchen-wench another day,
 Shapeless, wooden every way.
 Next, a fairy from the sun.

 Once you walked a grown-up strand
 Fish-wife siren, full of lure,
 Snaring with devices sure
 Lads who murdered on the sand.
 But on most days just a child
 Dimpled as no grown-folk are,
 Cold of kiss as some north star,
 Violet from the valleys wild.
 Snared as innocence must be,
 Fleeing, prisoned, chained, half-dead - 
 At the end of tortures dread
 Roaring cowboys set you free.

 Fly, O song, to her to-day,
 Like a cowboy cross the land.
 Snatch her from Belasco's hand
 And that prison called Broadway.

 All the village swains await
 One dear lily-girl demure,
 Saucy, dancing, cold and pure,
 Elf who must return in state.
