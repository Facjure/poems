 The sparrow dips in his wheel-rut bath,
 The sun grows passionate-eyed,
 And boils the dew to smoke by the paddock-path;
 As strenuously we stride, -
Five of us; dark He, fair He, dark She, fair She, I,
 All beating by.

 The air is shaken, the high-road hot,
 Shadowless swoons the day,
 The greens are sobered and cattle at rest; but not
 We on our urgent way, -
Four of us; fair She, dark She, fair He, I, are there,
 But one - elsewhere.

 Autumn moulds the hard fruit mellow,
 And forward still we press
 Through moors, briar-meshed plantations, clay-pits yellow,
 As in the spring hours - yes,
Three of us: fair He, fair She, I, as heretofore,
 But - fallen one more.

 The leaf drops: earthworms draw it in
 At night-time noiselessly,
 The fingers of birch and beech are skeleton-thin,
 And yet on the beat are we, -
Two of us; fair She, I. But no more left to go
 The track we know.

 Icicles tag the church-aisle leads,
 The flag-rope gibbers hoarse,
 The home-bound foot-folk wrap their snow-flaked heads,
 Yet I still stalk the course, -
One of us . . . Dark and fair He, dark and fair She, gone:
 The rest - anon.
