[1]

 A lion, mourning, in his age, the wane
 Of might once dreaded through his wild domain,
 Was mock'd, at last, upon his throne,
 By subjects of his own,
 Strong through his weakness grown.
 The horse his head saluted with a kick;
 The wolf snapp'd at his royal hide;
 The ox, too, gored him in the side;
 The unhappy lion, sad and sick,
 Could hardly growl, he was so weak.
 In uncomplaining, stoic pride,
 He waited for the hour of fate,
 Until the ass approach'd his gate;
 Whereat, 'This is too much,' he saith;
 'I willingly would yield my breath;
 But, ah! thy kick is double death!'
