title: Bright Thoughts For A Dark Day
---

Will the shadows be lifted to-morrow? - 
Will the sunshine come ever again? - 
Will the clouds, that are weeping in sorrow,
Their glorious beauty regain?
Will the forest stand forth in its greenness? - 
The meadows smile sweet as before? - 
And the sky, in its placid sereneness,
Bend lovingly o'er us once more?

Will the birds sing again as we heard them,
Ere the tempest their gentle notes hushed? - 
Will the breeze float again in its freedom,
Where lately its melody gushed?
Will the beautiful angel of sunset
Drape the heavens in crimson and gold,
As the day-king serenely retireth,
'Mid grandeur and glory untold?

Yea; the clouds will be lifted to-morrow,
From valley, and hill-top, and plain;
And sunshine, and gladness, and beauty
Will visit the landscape again; - 
The forest, the field, and the river
Will bask in the joy-giving ray;
And the angel of sunset, as ever,
Will smile o'er the farewell of day.

For the longest day hastes to its ending, - 
The darkest night speeds to the day; - 
O'er thickest clouds, ever, the sunbeam
Shines on with unfaltering ray; - 
Though thou walk amid shadows, thy Father
Makes His word and his promises thine;
And, whatever the storms that may gather,
At length thro' the gloom He will shine!
