 In the meadow's silk grasses we see the black snail,
 Creeping out at the close of the eve, sipping dew,
 While even's one star glitters over the vale,
 Like a lamp hung outside of that temple of blue.
 I walk with my true love adown the green vale,
 The light feathered grasses keep tapping her shoe;
 In the whitethorn the nightingale sings her sweet tale,
 And the blades of the grasses are sprinkled with dew.

 If she stumbles I catch her and cling to her neck,
 As the meadow-sweet kisses the blush of the rose:
 Her whisper none hears, and the kisses I take
 The mild voice of even will never disclose.
 Her hair hung in ringlets adown her sweet cheek,
 That blushed like the rose in the hedge hung with dew;
 Her whisper was fragrance, her face was so meek--
 The dove was the type on't that from the bush flew.
