title: The Philistine and the Bohemian
---

 She was a Philistine spick and span,
 He was a bold Bohemian.
 She had the mode, and the last at that;
 He had a cape and a brigand hat.
 She was so riant and chic and trim;
 He was so shaggy, unkempt and grim.
 On the rue de la Paix she was wont to shine;
 The rue de la Ga�t� was more his line.
 She doted on Barclay and Dell and Caine;
 He quoted Mallarm� and Paul Verlaine.
 She was a triumph at Tango teas;
 At Vorticist's suppers he sought to please.
 She thought that Franz Lehar was utterly great;
 Of Strauss and Stravinsky he'd piously prate.
 She loved elegance, he loved art;
 They were as wide as the poles apart:
 Yet - Cupid and Caprice are hand and glove - 
 They met at a dinner, they fell in love.

 Home he went to his garret bare,
 Thrilling with rapture, hope, despair.
 Swift he gazed in his looking-glass,
 Made a grimace and murmured: "Ass!"
 Seized his scissors and fiercely sheared,
 Severed his buccaneering beard;
 Grabbed his hair, and clip! clip! clip!
 Off came a bunch with every snip.
 Ran to a tailor's in startled state,
 Suits a dozen commanded straight;
 Coats and overcoats, pants in pairs,
 Everything that a dandy wears;
 Socks and collars, and shoes and ties,
 Everything that a dandy buys.
 Chums looked at him with wondering stare,
 Fancied they'd seen him before somewhere;
 A Brummell, a D'Orsay, a beau so fine,
 A shining, immaculate Philistine.

 Home she went in a raptured daze,
 Looked in a mirror with startled gaze,
 Didn't seem to be pleased at all;
 Savagely muttered: "Insipid Doll!"
 Clutched her hair and a pair of shears,
 Cropped and bobbed it behind the ears;
 Aimed at a wan and willowy-necked
 Sort of a Holman Hunt effect;
 Robed in subtile and sage-green tones,
 Like the dames of Rossetti and E. Burne-Jones;
 Girdled her garments billowing wide,
 Moved with an undulating glide;
 All her frivolous friends forsook,
 Cultivated a soulful look;
 Gushed in a voice with a creamy throb
 Over some weirdly Futurist daub - 
 Did all, in short, that a woman can
 To be a consummate Bohemian.

 A year went past with its hopes and fears,
 A year that seemed like a dozen years.
 They met once more. . . . Oh, at last! At last!
 They rushed together, they stopped aghast.
 They looked at each other with blank dismay,
 They simply hadn't a word to say.
 He thought with a shiver: "Can this be she?"
 She thought with a shudder: "This can't be he?"
 This simpering dandy, so sleek and spruce;
 This languorous lily in garments loose;
 They sought to brace from the awful shock:
 Taking a seat, they tried to talk.
 She spoke of Bergson and Pater's prose,
 He prattled of dances and ragtime shows;
 She purred of pictures, Matisse, Cezanne,
 His tastes to the girls of Kirchner ran;
 She raved of Tchaikovsky and Caesar Franck,
 He owned that he was a jazz-band crank!
 They made no headway. Alas! alas!
 He thought her a bore, she thought him an ass.
 And so they arose and hurriedly fled;
 Perish Illusion, Romance, you're dead.
 He loved elegance, she loved art,
 Better at once to part, to part.

 And what is the moral of all this rot?
 Don't try to be what you know you're not.
 And if you're made on a muttonish plan,
 Don't seek to seem a Bohemian;
 And if to the goats your feet incline,
 Don't try to pass for a Philistine.
