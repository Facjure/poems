title: Looking Upwards In A Storm.
---

God of my life, to thee I call,
Afflicted at thy feet I fall;
When the great water-floods prevail,[1]
Leave not my trembling heart to fail!


Friend of the friendless and the faint!
Where should I lodge my deep complaint?
Where but with thee, whose open door
Invites the helpless and the poor!


Did ever mourner plead with thee,
And thou refuse that mourner�s plea?
Does not the word still fix�d remain,
That none shall seek thy face in vain?


That were a grief I could not bear,
Didst thou not hear and answer prayer;
But a prayer-hearing, answering God,
Supports me under every load.


Fair is the lot that�s cast for me;
I have an Advocate with thee;
They whom the world caresses most
Have no such privilege to boast.


Poor though I am, despised, forgot,[2]
Yet God, my God, forgets me not:
And he is safe, and must succeed,
For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.
