title: On The Death Of Dr Burgess, The Late Bishop Of Salisbury.

 Sainted old man, for more than eighty years,
 Thee - tranquilly and stilly-creeping - age,
 Led to the confines of the sepulchre,
 And thy last day on earth - but "Father - Lord - 
 Which art in heaven" - how pure a faith, and heart
 Unmoved, amid the changes of this life,
 And tumult of the world, - and oh! what hope, - 
 What love and constancy of the calm mind,
 And tears to misery from the inmost heart
 Flowing - at times, a brief sweet smile and voice
 How bland, and studies, various and profound,
 Of learned languages - but, ever first,
 That learning which the oracles of God
 Unfolds, even to the close of life's long day
 Thy course accompanies!
 But, thou, farewell,
 And live - this mortal veil removed - in bliss;
 Live with the saints in light, whom Christ had loved.
 But pardon us, left in this vale of tears,
 For one last tear upon thy cold remains - 
 Pardon, beloved and venerated shade!
