title: The Ape.

 There is an ape in Paris,
 To which was given a wife:
 Like many a one that marries,
 This ape, in brutal strife,
 Soon beat her out of life.
 Their infant cries, - perhaps not fed, - 
 But cries, I ween, in vain;
 The father laughs: his wife is dead,
 And he has other loves again,
 Which he will also beat, I think, - 
 Return'd from tavern drown'd in drink.

 For aught that's good, you need not look
 Among the imitative tribe;
 A monkey be it, or what makes a book - 
 The worse, I deem - the aping scribe.
