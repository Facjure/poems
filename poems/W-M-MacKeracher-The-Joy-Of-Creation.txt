title: The Joy Of Creation.
---

How must have thrilled the great Creator's mind
 With radiant, glad and satisfying joy,
Ever new self-expressive forms to find
 In those six days of rapturous employ!
How must He have delighted when He made
 The stars, and meted ocean with His span,
And formed the insect and the tender blade,
 And fashioned, after His own image, man!

And unto man such joy in his degree
 He hath appointed, work of mind and hand,
To mould in forms of useful symmetry
 Words, hues, wood, iron, stone, at his command
To toil upon the navigable sea
 And ply his industry upon the land.
