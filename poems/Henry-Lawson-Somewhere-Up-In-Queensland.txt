title: Somewhere Up In Queensland
---

He's somewhere up in Queensland,
The old folks used to say;
He�s somewhere up in Queensland,
The people say to-day.
But Somewhere (up in Queensland)
That uncle used to know,
That filled our hearts with wonder,
Seems vanished long ago.

He�s gone to Queensland, droving,
The old folks used to say;
He�s gone to Queensland, droving,
The people say to-day.
But �gone to Queensland, droving,�
Might mean, in language plain,
He follows stock in buggies,
And gets supplies by train.

He�s knocking round in Queensland,
The old folks used to say;
He�s gone to Queensland, roving,
His sweetheart says to-day.
But �gone to Queensland, roving�
By mighty plain and scrub,
Might mean he drives a motor-car
For Missus Moneygrub.

He�s looking for new country,
The old folks used to say;
Our boy has gone exploring,
Fond parents say to-day.
�Exploring� out in Queensland
Might only mean to some
He�s salesman in �the drapery�
Of a bush emporium.

To somewhere up in Queensland
Went Tom and Ted and Jack;
From somewhere up in Queensland
The dusty cheques come back:
From somewhere up in Queensland
Brown drovers used to come,
And someone up in Queensland
Kept many a southern home.

Somewhere up in Queensland,
How many black sheep roam,
Who never write a letter,
And never think of home.
For someone up in Queensland
How many a mother spoke;
For someone up in Queensland
How many a girl�s heart broke.
