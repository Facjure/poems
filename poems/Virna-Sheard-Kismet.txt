Love came to her unsought,
 Love served her many ways,
And patiently Love followed her
 Throughout the nights and days.

Love spent his life for her
 And hid his tears and sighs;
He bartered all his soul for her,
 With tender pleading eyes.

Her scarlet mouth that smiled,
 Mocked lightly at his woe,
And while she would not bid him stay
 She did not bid him go.

But hope within him failed
 Until he pled no more - 
And cold and still he turned his face
 Away from her heart's door.

*****

Long were the days she watched
 For one who never came; - 
Through sleepless nights her white lips bore
 The burden of a name.
