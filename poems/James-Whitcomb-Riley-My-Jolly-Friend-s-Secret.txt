 Ah, friend of mine, how goes it
Since you've taken you a mate? -
 Your smile, though, plainly shows it
Is a very happy state!
 Dan Cupid's necromancy!
You must sit you down and dine,
 And lubricate your fancy
With a glass or two of wine.

 And as you have "deserted,"
As my other chums have done,
 While I laugh alone diverted,
As you drop off one by one - -
 And I've remained unwedded,
Till - you see - look here - that I'm,
 In a manner, "snatched bald-headed"
By the sportive hand of Time!

 I'm an "old 'un!" yes, but wrinkles
Are not so plenty, quite,
 As to cover up the twinkles
Of the boy - ain't I right?
 Yet there are ghosts of kisses
Under this mustache of mine
 My mem'ry only misses
When I drown 'em out with wine.

 From acknowledgment so ample,
You would hardly take me for
 What I am - a perfect sample
Of a "jolly bachelor";
 Not a bachelor has being
When he laughs at married life
 But his heart and soul's agreeing
That he ought to have a wife!

 Ah, ha! old chum, this claret,
Like Fatima, holds the key
 Of the old Blue-Beardish garret
Of my hidden mystery!
 Did you say you'd like to listen?
Ah, my boy! the "Sad No More!"
 And the tear-drops that will glisten -
Turn the catch upon the door,

 And sit you down beside me
And put yourself at ease -
 I'll trouble you to slide me
That wine decanter, please;
 The path is kind o' mazy
Where my fancies have to go,
 And my heart gets sort o' lazy
On the journey - don't you know?

 Let me see - when I was twenty -
It's a lordly age, my boy,
 When a fellow's money's plenty,
And the leisure to enjoy -

 And a girl - with hair as golden
As - that; and lips - well - quite
 As red as this I'm holdin'
Between you and the light?

 And eyes and a complexion -
Ah, heavens! - le'-me-see -
 Well, - just in this connection, -
Did you lock that door for me?
 Did I start in recitation
My past life to recall?
 Well, that's an indication
I am purty tight - that's all!
