title: Lines Read At A Ladies' Aid.
---

After chatting with each friend,
We our way to the table wend,
On it we all do make a raid,
And this we call a ladies' aid.

'Tis pleasant way of taking tea,
Improvement on the old soiree,
On such a time as this I find
Food for body and for mind.

Gladly all obey the call,
To attend this pleasant social,
And we hope none will lament
The time and money they have spent.
