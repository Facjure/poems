 Argument Of The Fourth Book.


In a Council of the Gods, a dispute arises between Jupiter and Juno, which is at last compromised, Jove consenting to dispatch Minerva with a charge to incite some Trojan to a violation of the truce. Minerva descends for that purpose, and in the form of Laodocus, a son of Priam, exhorts Pandarus to shoot at Menelaus, and succeeds. Menelaus is wounded, and Agamemnon having consigned him to the care of Machaon, goes forth to perform the duties of commander-in-chief, in the encouragement of his host to battle. The battle begins.



 Now, on the golden floor of Jove's abode
 The Gods all sat consulting; Hebe them,
 Graceful, with nectar served;[1] they pledging each
 His next, alternate quaff'd from cups of gold,
 And at their ease reclined, look'd down on Troy,
 When, sudden, Jove essay'd by piercing speech
 Invidious, to enkindle Juno's ire.
 Two Goddesses on Menelaus' part
 Confederate stand, Juno in Argos known,
 Pallas in Alalcomene;[2] yet they
 Sequester'd sit, look on, and are amused.
 Not so smile-loving Venus; she, beside
 Her champion station'd, saves him from his fate,
 And at this moment, by her aid, he lives.
 But now, since victory hath proved the lot
 Of warlike Menelaus, weigh ye well
 The matter; shall we yet the ruinous strife
 Prolong between the nations, or consent
 To give them peace? should peace your preference win,
 And prove alike acceptable to all,
 Stand Ilium, and let Menelaus bear
 Helen of Argos back to Greece again.
 He ended; Juno and Minerva heard,
 Low-murmuring deep disgust; for side by side
 They forging sat calamity to Troy.
 Minerva through displeasure against Jove
 Nought utter'd, for with rage her bosom boil'd;
 But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied.
 What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe!
 How? wouldst thou render fruitless all my pains?
 The sweat that I have pour'd? my steeds themselves
 Have fainted while I gather'd Greece in arms
 For punishment of Priam and his sons.
 Do it. But small thy praise shall be in heaven.
 Then her the Thunderer answer'd sore displeased.
 Ah shameless! how have Priam and his sons
 So much transgress'd against thee, that thou burn'st
 With ceaseless rage to ruin populous Troy?
 Go, make thine entrance at her lofty gates,
 Priam and all his house, and all his host
 Alive devour; then, haply, thou wilt rest;
 Do even as thou wilt, that this dispute
 Live not between us a consuming fire
 For ever. But attend; mark well the word.
 When I shall also doom in future time
 Some city to destruction, dear to thee,
 Oppose me not, but give my fury way
 As I give way to thine, not pleased myself,
 Yet not unsatisfied, so thou be pleased.
 For of all cities of the sons of men,
 And which the sun and stars from heaven behold,
 Me sacred Troy most pleases, Priam me
 Most, and the people of the warrior King.
 Nor without cause. They feed mine altar well;
 Libation there, and steam of savory scent
 Fail not, the tribute which by lot is ours.
 Him answer'd, then, the Goddess ample-eyed,[3]
 Majestic Juno: Three fair cities me,
 Of all the earth, most interest and engage,
 Mycen� for magnificence renown'd,
 Argos, and Sparta. Them, when next thy wrath
 Shall be inflamed against them, lay thou waste;
 I will not interpose on their behalf;
 Thou shalt not hear me murmur; what avail
 Complaint or force against thy matchless arm?
 Yet were it most unmeet that even I
 Should toil in vain; I also boast a birth
 Celestial; Saturn deeply wise, thy Sire,
 Is also mine; our origin is one.
 Thee I acknowledge Sovereign, yet account
 Myself entitled by a twofold claim
 To veneration both from Gods and men,
 The daughter of Jove's sire, and spouse of Jove.
 Concession mutual therefore both thyself
 Befits and me, whom when the Gods perceive
 Disposed to peace, they also shall accord.
 Come then.--To yon dread field dispatch in haste
 Minerva, with command that she incite
 The Trojans first to violate their oath
 By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.
 So Juno; nor the sire of all refused,
 But in wing'd accents thus to Pallas spake.
 Begone; swift fly to yonder field; incite
 The Trojans first to violate their oath
 By some fresh insult on the exulting Greeks.
 The Goddess heard, and what she wish'd, enjoin'd,
 Down-darted swift from the Olympian heights,
 In form a meteor, such as from his hand
 Not seldom Jove dismisses, beaming bright
 And breaking into stars, an omen sent
 To mariners, or to some numerous host.
 Such Pallas seem'd, and swift descending, dropp'd
 Full in the midst between them. They with awe
 That sign portentous and with wonder view'd,
 Achaians both and Trojans, and his next
 The soldier thus bespake. Now either war
 And dire hostility again shall flame,
 Or Jove now gives us peace. Both are from Jove.
 So spake the soldiery; but she the form
 Taking of brave Laodocus, the son
 Of old Antenor, throughout all the ranks
 Sought godlike Pandarus.[4] Ere long she found
 The valiant son illustrious of Lycaon,
 Standing encompass'd by his dauntless troops,
 Broad-shielded warriors, from �sepus' stream
 His followers; to his side the Goddess came,
 And in wing'd accents ardent him bespake.
 Brave offspring of Lycaon, is there hope
 That thou wilt hear my counsel? darest thou slip
 A shaft at Menelaus? much renown
 Thou shalt and thanks from all the Trojans win,
 But most of all, from Paris, prince of Troy.
 From him illustrious gifts thou shalt receive
 Doubtless, when Menelaus he shall see
 The martial son of Atreus by a shaft
 Subdued of thine, placed on his funeral pile.
 Come. Shoot at Menelaus, glorious Chief!
 But vow to Lycian Phoebus bow-renown'd
 A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,
 To fair Zeleia's[5] walls once safe restored.
 So Pallas spake, to whom infatuate he
 Listening, uncased at once his polished bow.[6]
 That bow, the laden brows of a wild goat
 Salacious had supplied; him on a day
 Forth-issuing from his cave, in ambush placed
 He wounded with an arrow to his breast
 Dispatch'd, and on the rock supine he fell.
 Each horn had from his head tall growth attain'd,
 Full sixteen palms; them shaven smooth the smith
 Had aptly join'd, and tipt their points with gold.
 That bow he strung, then, stooping, planted firm
 The nether horn, his comrades bold the while
 Screening him close with shields, lest ere the prince
 Were stricken, Menelaus brave in arms,
 The Greeks with fierce assault should interpose.
 He raised his quiver's lid; he chose a dart
 Unflown, full-fledged, and barb'd with pangs of death.
 He lodged in haste the arrow on the string,
 And vow'd to Lycian Phoebus bow-renown'd
 A hecatomb, all firstlings of the flock,
 To fair Zeleia's walls once safe restored.
 Compressing next nerve and notch'd arrow-head
 He drew back both together, to his pap
 Drew home the nerve, the barb home to his bow,
 And when the horn was curved to a wide arch,
 He twang'd it. Whizz'd the bowstring, and the reed
 Leap'd off, impatient for the distant throng.
 Thee, Menelaus, then the blessed Gods
 Forgat not; Pallas huntress of the spoil,
 Thy guardian then, baffled the cruel dart.
 Far as a mother wafts the fly aside[7]
 That haunts her slumbering babe, so far she drove
 Its course aslant, directing it herself
 Against the golden clasps that join'd his belt;
 For there the doubled hauberk interposed.
 The bitter arrow plunged into his belt.
 It pierced his broider'd belt, stood fixt within
 His twisted hauberk, nor the interior quilt,
 Though penetrable least to arrow-points
 And his best guard, withheld it, but it pass'd
 That also, and the Hero's skin inscribed.
 Quick flowed a sable current from the wound.
 As when a Carian or M�onian maid
 Impurples ivory ordain'd to grace
 The cheek of martial steed; safe stored it lies,
 By many a Chief desired, but proves at last
 The stately trapping of some prince,[8] the pride
 Of his high pamper'd steed, nor less his own;
 Such, Menelaus, seem'd thy shapely thighs,
 Thy legs, thy feet, stained with thy trickling blood.
 Shudder'd King Agamemnon when he saw
 The blood fast trickling from the wound, nor less
 Shudder'd himself the bleeding warrior bold.
 But neck and barb observing from the flesh
 Extant, he gather'd heart, and lived again.
 The royal Agamemnon, sighing, grasp'd
 The hand of Menelaus, and while all
 Their followers sigh'd around them, thus began.[9]
 I swore thy death, my brother, when I swore
 This truce, and set thee forth in sight of Greeks
 And Trojans, our sole champion; for the foe
 Hath trodden underfoot his sacred oath,
 And stained it with thy blood. But not in vain,
 The truce was ratified, the blood of lambs
 Poured forth, libation made, and right hands join'd
 In holy confidence. The wrath of Jove
 May sleep, but will not always; they shall pay
 Dear penalty; their own obnoxious heads
 Shall be the mulct, their children and their wives.
 For this I know, know surely; that a day
 Shall come, when Ilium, when the warlike King
 Of Ilium and his host shall perish all.
 Saturnian Jove high-throned, dwelling in heaven,
 Resentful of this outrage, then shall shake
 His storm-clad �gis over them. He will;
 I speak no fable. Time shall prove me true.
 But, oh my Menelaus, dire distress
 Awaits me, if thy close of life be come,
 And thou must die. Then ignominy foul
 Shall hunt me back to Argos long-desired;
 For then all here will recollect their home,
 And, hope abandoning, will Helen yield
 To be the boast of Priam, and of Troy.
 So shall our toils be vain, and while thy bones
 Shall waste these clods beneath, Troy's haughty sons
 The tomb of Menelaus glory-crown'd
 Insulting barbarous, shall scoff at me.
 So may Atrides, shall they say, perform
 His anger still as he performed it here,
 Whither he led an unsuccessful host,
 Whence he hath sail'd again without the spoils,
 And where he left his brother's bones to rot.
 So shall the Trojan speak; then open earth
 Her mouth, and hide me in her deepest gulfs!
 But him, the hero of the golden locks
 Thus cheer'd. My brother, fear not, nor infect
 With fear the Grecians; the sharp-pointed reed
 Hath touch'd no vital part. The broider'd zone,
 The hauberk, and the tough interior quilt,
 Work of the armorer, its force repress'd.
 Him answer'd Agamemnon, King of men.
 So be it brother! but the hand of one
 Skilful to heal shall visit and shall dress
 The wound with drugs of pain-assuaging power.
 He ended, and his noble herald, next,
 Bespake, Talthybius. Haste, call hither quick
 The son of �sculapius, leech renown'd,
 The prince Machaon. Bid him fly to attend
 The warlike Chieftain Menelaus; him
 Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,
 A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft
 To his own glory, and to our distress.
 He spake, nor him the herald disobey'd,
 But through the Greeks bright-arm'd his course began
 The Hero seeking earnest on all sides
 Machaon. Him, ere long, he station'd saw
 Amid the shielded-ranks of his brave band
 From steed-famed Tricca drawn, and at his side
 With accents ardor-wing'd, him thus address'd.
 Haste, Asclepiades! The King of men
 Calls thee. Delay not. Thou must visit quick
 Brave Menelaus, Atreus' son, for him
 Some archer, either Lycian or of Troy,
 A dexterous one, hath stricken with a shaft
 To his own glory, and to our distress.
 So saying, he roused Machaon, who his course
 Through the wide host began. Arriving soon
 Where wounded Menelaus stood, while all
 The bravest of Achaia's host around
 The godlike hero press'd, he strove at once
 To draw the arrow from his cincture forth.
 But, drawing, bent the barbs. He therefore loosed
 His broider'd belt, his hauberk and his quilt,
 Work of the armorer, and laying bare
 His body where the bitter shaft had plow'd
 His flesh, he suck'd the wound, then spread it o'er
 With drugs of balmy power, given on a time
 For friendship's sake by Chiron to his sire.
 While Menelaus thus the cares engross'd
 Of all those Chiefs, the shielded powers of Troy
 'Gan move toward them, and the Greeks again
 Put on their armor, mindful of the fight.
 Then hadst thou[10] not great Agamemnon seen
 Slumbering, or trembling, or averse from war,
 But ardent to begin his glorious task.
 His steeds, and his bright chariot brass-inlaid
 He left; the snorting steeds Eurymedon,
 Offspring of Ptolemy Pira�des
 Detain'd apart; for him he strict enjoin'd
 Attendance near, lest weariness of limbs
 Should seize him marshalling his numerous host.
 So forth he went, and through the files on foot
 Proceeding, where the warrior Greeks he saw
 Alert, he roused them by his words the more.[11]
 Argives! abate no spark of all your fire.
 Jove will not prosper traitors. Them who first
 Transgress'd the truce the vultures shall devour,
 But we (their city taken) shall their wives
 Lead captive, and their children home to Greece.
 So cheer'd he them. But whom he saw supine,
 Or in the rugged work of war remiss,
 In terms of anger them he stern rebuked.
 Oh Greeks! The shame of Argos! Arrow-doom'd!
 Blush ye not? Wherefore stand ye thus aghast,
 Like fawns which wearied after scouring wide
 The champain, gaze and pant, and can no more?
 Senseless like them ye stand, nor seek the fight.
 Is it your purpose patient here to wait
 Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore
 Of the grey deep, that ye may trial make
 Of Jove, if he will prove, himself, your shield?
 Thus, in discharge of his high office, pass'd
 Atrides through the ranks, and now arrived
 Where, hardy Chief! Idomeneus in front
 Of his bold Cretans stood, stout as a boar
 The van he occupied, while in the rear
 Meriones harangued the most remote.
 Them so prepared the King of men beheld
 With joyful heart, and thus in courteous terms
 Instant the brave Idomeneus address'd.
 Thee fighting, feasting, howsoe'er employed,
 I most respect, Idomeneus, of all
 The well-horsed Dan�i; for when the Chiefs
 Of Argos, banqueting, their beakers charge
 With rosy wine the honorable meed
 Of valor, thou alone of all the Greeks
 Drink'st not by measure.[12] No--thy goblet stands
 Replenish'd still, and like myself thou know'st
 No rule or bound, save what thy choice prescribes.
 March. Seek the foe. Fight now as heretofore,
 To whom Idomeneus of Crete replied,
 Atrides! all the friendship and the love
 Which I have promised will I well perform.
 Go; animate the rest, Chief after Chief
 Of the Achaians, that the fight begin.
 For Troy has scatter'd to the winds all faith,
 All conscience; and for such her treachery foul
 Shall have large recompence of death and wo.
 He said, whom Agamemnon at his heart
 Exulting, pass'd, and in his progress came
 Where stood each Ajax; them he found prepared
 With all their cloud of infantry behind.
 As when the goat-herd on some rocky point
 Advanced, a cloud sees wafted o'er the deep
 By western gales, and rolling slow along,
 To him, who stands remote, pitch-black it seems,
 And comes with tempest charged; he at the sight
 Shuddering, his flock compels into a cave;
 So moved the gloomy phalanx, rough with spears,
 And dense with shields of youthful warriors bold,
 Close-following either Ajax to the fight.
 Them also, pleased, the King of men beheld,
 And in wing'd accents hail'd them as he pass'd.
 Brave leaders of the mail-clad host of Greece!
 I move not you to duty; ye yourselves
 Move others, and no lesson need from me.
 Jove, Pallas, and Apollo! were but all
 Courageous as yourselves, soon Priam's towers
 Should totter, and his Ilium storm'd and sack'd
 By our victorious bands, stoop to the dust.
 He ceased, and still proceeding, next arrived
 Where stood the Pylian orator, his band
 Marshalling under all their leaders bold
 Alastor, Chromius, Pelagon the vast,
 H�mon the prince, and Bias, martial Chief.
 Chariot and horse he station'd in the front;
 His numerous infantry, a strong reserve
 Right valiant, in the rear; the worst, and those
 In whom he trusted least, he drove between,
 That such through mere necessity might act.
 First to his charioteers he gave in charge
 Their duty; bade them rein their horses hard,
 Shunning confusion. Let no warrior, vain
 And overweening of his strength or skill,
 Start from his rank to dare the fight alone,
 Or fall behind it, weakening whom he leaves.
 [13]And if, dismounted from his own, he climb
 Another's chariot, let him not affect
 Perverse the reins, but let him stand, his spear
 Advancing firm, far better so employ'd.
 Such was the discipline, in ancient times,
 Of our forefathers; by these rules they fought
 Successful, and laid many a city low.
 So counsell'd them the venerable Chief
 Long time expert in arms; him also saw
 King Agamemnon with delight, and said,
 Old Chief! ah how I wish, that thy firm heart
 Were but supported by as firm a knee!
 But time unhinges all. Oh that some youth
 Had thine old age, and thou wast young again!
 To whom the valiant Nestor thus replied.
 Atrides, I could also ardent wish
 That I were now robust as when I struck
 Brave Ereuthalion[14] breathless to the ground!
 But never all their gifts the Gods confer
 On man at once; if then I had the force
 Of youth, I suffer now the effects of age.
 Yet ancient as I am, I will be seen
 Still mingling with the charioteers, still prompt
 To give them counsel; for to counsel youth
 Is the old warrior's province. Let the green
 In years, my juniors, unimpaired by time,
 Push with the lance, for they have strength to boast.
 So he, whom Agamemnon joyful heard,
 And passing thence, the son of Peteos found
 Menestheus, foremost in equestrian fame,
 Among the brave Athenians; near to him
 Ulysses held his station, and at hand
 The Cephallenians stood, hardy and bold;
 For rumor none of the approaching fight
 Them yet had reach'd, so recent had the stir
 Arisen in either host; they, therefore, watch'd
 Till the example of some other band
 Marching, should prompt them to begin the fight,
 But Agamemnon, thus, the King of men
 Them seeing, sudden and severe reproved.
 Menestheus, son of Peteos prince renown'd,
 And thou, deviser of all evil wiles!
 Adept in artifice! why stand ye here
 Appall'd? why wait ye on this distant spot
 'Till others move? I might expect from you
 More readiness to meet the burning war,
 Whom foremost I invite of all to share
 The banquet, when the Princes feast with me.
 There ye are prompt; ye find it pleasant there
 To eat your savory food, and quaff your wine
 Delicious 'till satiety ensue;
 But here you could be well content to stand
 Spectators only, while ten Grecian troops
 Should wage before you the wide-wasting war.
 To whom Ulysses, with resentful tone
 Dark-frowning, thus replied. What words are these
 Which have escaped thy lips; and for what cause,
 Atrides, hast thou call'd me slow to fight?
 When we of Greece shall in sharp contest clash
 With you steed-tamer Trojans, mark me then;
 Then thou shalt see (if the concerns of war
 So nearly touch thee, and thou so incline)
 The father of Telemachus, engaged
 Among the foremost Trojans. But thy speech
 Was light as is the wind, and rashly made.
 When him thus moved he saw, the monarch smiled
 Complacent, and in gentler terms replied.
 La�rtes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!
 Short reprimand and exhortation short
 Suffice for thee, nor did I purpose more.
 For I have known thee long, that thou art one
 Of kindest nature, and so much my friend
 That we have both one heart. Go therefore thou,
 Lead on, and if a word have fallen amiss,
 We will hereafter mend it, and may heaven
 Obliterate in thine heart its whole effect!
 He ceased, and ranging still along the line,
 The son of Tydeus, Diomede, perceived,
 Heroic Chief, by chariots all around
 Environ'd, and by steeds, at side of whom
 Stood Sthenelus, the son of Capaneus.
 Him also, Agamemnon, King of men,
 In accents of asperity reproved.
 Ah, son of Tydeus, Chief of dauntless heart
 And of equestrian fame! why standest thou
 Appall'd, and peering through the walks of war?
 So did not Tydeus. In the foremost fight
 His favorite station was, as they affirm
 Who witness'd his exploits; I never saw
 Or met him, but by popular report
 He was the bravest warrior of his day.
 Yet came he once, but not in hostile sort,
 To fair Mycen�, by the godlike prince
 Attended, Polynices, at what time
 The host was called together, and the siege
 Was purposed of the sacred city Thebes.
 Earnest they sued for an auxiliar band,
 Which we had gladly granted, but that Jove
 By unpropitious tokens interfered.
 So forth they went, and on the reedy banks
 Arriving of Asopus, there thy sire
 By designation of the Greeks was sent
 Ambassador, and enter'd Thebes. He found
 In Eteocles' palace numerous guests,
 The sons of Cadmus feasting, among whom,
 Although a solitary stranger, stood
 Thy father without fear, and challenged forth
 Their best to cope with him in manly games.
 Them Tydeus vanquish'd easily, such aid
 Pallas vouchsafed him. Then the spur-arm'd race
 Of Cadmus was incensed, and fifty youths
 In ambush close expected his return.
 Them, Lycophontes obstinate in fight,
 Son of Autophonus, and M�on, son
 Of H�mon, Chief of godlike stature, led.
 Those also Tydeus slew; M�on except,
 (Whom, warned from heaven, he spared, and sent him home
 With tidings of the rest) he slew them all.
 Such was �tolian Tydeus; who begat
 A son in speech his better, not in arms.
 He ended, and his sovereign's awful voice
 Tydides reverencing, nought replied;
 But thus the son of glorious Capaneus.
 Atrides, conscious of the truth, speak truth.
 We with our sires compared, superior praise
 Claim justly.[15] We, confiding in the aid
 Of Jove, and in propitious signs from heaven,
 Led to the city consecrate to Mars
 Our little host, inferior far to theirs,
 And took seven-gated Thebes, under whose walls
 Our fathers by their own imprudence fell.
 Their glory, then, match never more with ours.
 He spake, whom with a frowning brow the brave
 Tydides answer'd. Sthenelus, my friend!
 I give thee counsel. Mark it. Hold thy peace.
 If Agamemnon, who hath charge of all,
 Excite his well-appointed host to war,
 He hath no blame from me. For should the Greeks
 (Her people vanquished) win imperial Troy,
 The glory shall be his; or, if his host
 O'erpower'd in battle perish, his the shame.
 Come, therefore; be it ours to rouse at once
 To action all the fury of our might.
 He said, and from his chariot to the plain
 Leap'd ardent; rang the armor on the breast
 Of the advancing Chief; the boldest heart
 Had felt emotion, startled at the sound.
 As when the waves by Zephyrus up-heaved
 Crowd fast toward some sounding shore, at first,
 On the broad bosom of the deep their heads
 They curl on high, then breaking on the land
 Thunder, and o'er the rocks that breast the flood
 Borne turgid, scatter far the showery spray;
 So moved the Greeks successive, rank by rank,
 And phalanx after phalanx, every Chief
 His loud command proclaiming, while the rest,
 As voice in all those thousands none had been
 Heard mute; and, in resplendent armor clad,
 With martial order terrible advanced.
 Not so the Trojans came. As sheep, the flock
 Of some rich man, by thousands in his court
 Penn'd close at milking time, incessant bleat,
 Loud answering all their bleating lambs without,
 Such din from Ilium's wide-spread host arose.
 Nor was their shout, nor was their accent one,
 But mingled languages were heard of men
 From various climes. These Mars to battle roused,
 Those Pallas azure-eyed; nor Terror thence
 Nor Flight was absent, nor insatiate Strife,
 Sister and mate of homicidal Mars,
 Who small at first, but swift to grow, from earth
 Her towering crest lifts gradual to the skies.
 She, foe alike to both, the brands dispersed
 Of burning hate between them, and the woes
 Enhanced of battle wheresoe'er she pass'd.
 And now the battle join'd. Shield clash'd with shield[16]
 And spear with spear, conflicting corselets rang,
 Boss'd bucklers met, and tumult wild arose.
 Then, many a yell was heard, and many a shout
 Loud intermix'd, the slayer o'er the maim'd
 Exulting, and the field was drench'd with blood.
 As when two winter torrents rolling down
 The mountains, shoot their floods through gulleys huge
 Into one gulf below, station'd remote
 The shepherd in the uplands hears the roar;
 Such was the thunder of the mingling hosts.
 And first, Antilochus a Trojan Chief
 Slew Echepolus, from Thalysias sprung,
 Contending valiant in the van of Troy.
 Him smiting on his crested casque, he drove
 The brazen lance into his front, and pierced
 The bones within; night overspread his eyes,
 And in fierce battle, like a tower, he fell.
 Him fallen by both feet Calchodon's son
 Seized, royal Elephenor, leader brave
 Of the Abantes, and in haste to strip
 His armor, drew him from the fight aside.
 But short was that attempt. Him so employ'd
 Dauntless Agenor mark'd, and as he stoop'd,
 In his unshielded flank a pointed spear
 Implanted deep; he languid sunk and died.
 So Elephenor fell, for whom arose
 Sharp conflict; Greeks and Trojans mutual flew
 Like wolves to battle, and man grappled man.
 Then Telamonian Ajax, in his prime
 Of youthful vigor Sim�isius slew,[17]
 Son of Anthemion. Him on Simo�s' banks
 His mother bore, when with her parents once
 She came from Ida down to view the flocks,
 And thence they named him; but his parents'
 He lived not to requite, in early youth
 Slain by the spear of Ajax famed in arms.
 For him advancing Ajax at the pap
 Wounded; right through his shoulder driven the point
 Stood forth behind; he fell, and press'd the dust.
 So in some spacious marsh the poplar falls
 Smooth-skinn'd, with boughs unladen save aloft;
 Some chariot-builder with his axe the trunk
 Severs, that he may warp it to a wheel
 Of shapely form; meantime exposed it lies
 To parching airs beside the running stream;
 Such Sim�isius seemed, Anthemion's son,
 Whom noble Ajax slew. But soon at him
 Antiphus, son of Priam, bright in arms,
 Hurl'd through the multitude his pointed spear.
 He erred from Ajax, but he pierced the groin
 Of Leucus, valiant warrior of the band
 Led by Ulysses. He the body dragg'd
 Apart, but fell beside it, and let fall,
 Breathless himself, the burthen from his hand.
 Then burn'd Ulysses' wrath for Leucus slain,
 And through the foremost combatants, array'd
 In dazzling arms, he rush'd. Full near he stood,
 And, looking keen around him, hurl'd a lance.
 Back fell the Trojans from before the face
 Dispersed of great Ulysses. Not in vain
 His weapon flew, but on the field outstretch'd
 A spurious son of Priam, from the shores
 Call'd of Abydus famed for fleetest mares,
 Democoon; him, for Leucus' sake enraged,
 Ulysses through both temples with his spear
 Transpierced. The night of death hung on his eyes,
 And sounding on his batter'd arms he fell.
 Then Hector and the van of Troy retired;
 Loud shout the Grecians; these draw off the dead,
 Those onward march amain, and from the heights
 Of Pergamus Apollo looking down
 In anger, to the Trojans called aloud.
 Turn, turn, ye Trojans! face your Grecian foes.
 They, like yourselves, are vulnerable flesh,
 Not adamant or steel. Your direst dread
 Achilles, son of Thetis radiant-hair'd,
 Fights not, but sullen in his fleet abides.[18]
 Such from the citadel was heard the voice
 Of dread Apollo. But Minerva ranged
 Meantime, Tritonian progeny of Jove,
 The Grecians, rousing whom she saw remiss.
 Then Amarynceus' son, Diores, felt
 The force of fate, bruised by a rugged rock
 At his right heel, which Pirus, Thracian Chief,
 The son of Imbrasus of �nos, threw.
 Bones and both tendons in its fall the mass
 Enormous crush'd. He, stretch'd in dust supine,
 With palms outspread toward his warrior friends
 Lay gasping life away. But he who gave
 The fatal blow, Pirus, advancing, urged
 Into his navel a keen lance, and shed
 His bowels forth; then, darkness veil'd his eyes.
 Nor Pirus long survived; him through the breast
 Above the pap, �tolian Thoas pierced,
 And in his lungs set fast the quivering spear.
 Then Thoas swift approach'd, pluck'd from the wound
 His stormy spear, and with his falchion bright
 Gashing his middle belly, stretch'd him dead.
 Yet stripp'd he not the slain, whom with long spears
 His Thracians hairy-scalp'd[19] so round about
 Encompassed, that though bold and large of limb
 Were Thoas, from before them him they thrust
 Staggering and reeling in his forced retreat.
 They therefore in the dust, the Epean Chief
 Diores, and the Thracian, Pirus lay
 Stretch'd side by side, with numerous slain around.
 Then had Minerva led through all that field
 Some warrior yet unhurt, him sheltering safe
 From all annoyance dread of dart or spear,
 No cause of blame in either had he found
 That day, so many Greeks and Trojans press'd,
 Extended side by side, the dusty plain.
