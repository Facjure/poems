title: Manticor In Arabia.

 (The manticors of the montaines
 Mighte feed them on thy braines., Skelton.)

 Thick and scented daisies spread
 Where with surface dull like lead
 Arabian pools of slime invite
 Manticors down from neighbouring height
 To dip heads, to cool fiery blood
 In oozy depths of sucking mud.
 Sing then of ringstraked manticor,
 Man-visaged tiger who of yore
 Held whole Arabian waste in fee
 With raging pride from sea to sea,
 That every lesser tribe would fly
 Those armed feet, that hooded eye;
 Till preying on himself at last
 Manticor dwindled, sank, was passed
 By gryphon flocks he did disdain.
 Ay, wyverns and rude dragons reign
 In ancient keep of manticor
 Agreed old foe can rise no more.
 Only here from lakes of slime
 Drinks manticor and bides due time:
 Six times Fowl Phoenix in yon tree
 Must mount his pyre and burn and be
 Renewed again, till in such hour
 As seventh Phoenix flames to power
 And lifts young feathers, overnice
 From scented pool of steamy spice
 Shall manticor his sway restore
 And rule Arabian plains once more.
