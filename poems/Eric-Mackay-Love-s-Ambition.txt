XI. Love's Ambition.


I must invoke thee for my spirit's good,
 And prove myself un-guilty of the crime
Of mere self-seeking, though with this imbued.
I sing as sings the mavis in a wood,
 Content to be alive at harvest time.
Had I its wings I should not be withstood!
 But I will weave my fancies into rhyme,
 And greet afar the heights I cannot climb.
I will invoke thee, Love! though far away,
 And pay thee homage, as becomes a knight
 Who longs to keep his true-love in his sight.
Yea, I will soar to thee, in roundelay,
In shine and shower, and make a bold assay
 Of each fond hope, to compass thee aright.
