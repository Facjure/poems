title: A Dead City
---

The twilight reigns above the fallen noon
 Within an ancient land, whose after-time
 Lies like a shadow o'er its ruined prime.
Like rising mist the night increases soon
Round shattered palaces, ere yet the moon
 On mute, unsentried walls and turrets climb,
 And touch with whiteness of sepulchral rime
The desert where a city's bones are strewn.

She comes at last; unburied, thick, they show
 In all the hoary nakedness of stone.
From out a shadow like the lips of Death
 Issues a wind, that through the stillness blown,
Cries like a prophet's ghost with wailing breath
The weirds of finished and forgotten woe.
