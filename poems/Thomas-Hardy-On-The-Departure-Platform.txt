title: On The Departure Platform
---

We kissed at the barrier; and passing through
She left me, and moment by moment got
Smaller and smaller, until to my view
 She was but a spot;

A wee white spot of muslin fluff
That down the diminishing platform bore
Through hustling crowds of gentle and rough
 To the carriage door.

Under the lamplight's fitful glowers,
Behind dark groups from far and near,
Whose interests were apart from ours,
 She would disappear,

Then show again, till I ceased to see
That flexible form, that nebulous white;
And she who was more than my life to me
 Had vanished quite . . .

We have penned new plans since that fair fond day,
And in season she will appear again -
Perhaps in the same soft white array -
 But never as then!

- "And why, young man, must eternally fly
A joy you'll repeat, if you love her well?"
 - O friend, nought happens twice thus; why,
 I cannot tell!
