 I strolled last eve across the lonely down;
 One solitary picture struck my eye:
 A distant ploughboy stood against the sky - 
 How far he seemed above the noisy town!

 Upon the bosom of a cloud the sod
 Laid its bruised cheek as he moved slowly by,
 And, watching him, I asked myself if I
 In very truth stood half as near to God.
