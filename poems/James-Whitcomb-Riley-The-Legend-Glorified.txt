title: The Legend Glorified.

 "I deem that God is not disquieted" -
 This in a mighty poet's rhymes I read;
 And blazoned so forever doth abide
 Within my soul the legend glorified.

 Though awful tempests thunder overhead,
 I deem that God is not disquieted, -
 The faith that trembles somewhat yet is sure
 Through storm and darkness of a way secure.

 Bleak winters, when the naked spirit hears
 The break of hearts, through stinging sleet of tears,
 I deem that God is not disquieted;
 Against all stresses am I clothed and fed.

 Nay, even with fixed eyes and broken breath,
 My feet dip down into the tides of death,
 Nor any friend be left, nor prayer be said,
 I deem that God is not disquieted.
