I heard a bird at dawn
 Singing sweetly on a tree,
That the dew was on the lawn,
 And the wind was on the lea;
But I didn't listen to him,
 For he didn't sing to me.

I didn't listen to him,
 For he didn't sing to me
That the dew was on the lawn
 And the wind was on the lea;
I was singing at the time
 Just as prettily as he.

I was singing all the time,
 Just as prettily as he,
About the dew upon the lawn
 And the wind upon the lea;
So I didn't listen to him
 And he sang upon a tree.
