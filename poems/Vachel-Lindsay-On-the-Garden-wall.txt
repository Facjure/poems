(Moon Poems for the Children/Fairy-tales for the Children)

 Oh, once I walked a garden
 In dreams.'Twas yellow grass.
 And many orange-trees grew there
 In sand as white as glass.
 The curving, wide wall-border
 Was marble, like the snow.
 I walked that wall a fairy-prince
 And, pacing quaint and slow,
 Beside me were my pages,
 Two giant, friendly birds.
 Half-swan they were, half peacock.
 They spake in courtier-words.
 Their inner wings a chariot,
 Their outer wings for flight,
 They lifted me from dreamland.
 We bade those trees good-night.
 Swiftly above the stars we rode.
 I looked below me soon.
 The white-walled garden I had ruled
 Was one lone flower - the moon.
