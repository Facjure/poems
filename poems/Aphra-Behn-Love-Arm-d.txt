title: Love Arm'd
---

Love in Fantastique Triumph satt, 
Whilst bleeding Hearts around him flow'd, 
For whom Fresh pains he did create, 
And strange Tryanic power he show'd; 
From thy Bright Eyes he took his fire, 
Which round about, in sport he hurl'd; 
But 'twas from mine he took desire, 
Enough to undo the Amorous World. 
From me he took his sighs and tears, 
From thee his Pride and Crueltie; 
From me his Languishments and Feares, 
And every Killing Dart from thee; 
Thus thou and I, the God have arm'd, 
And sett him up a Deity; 
But my poor Heart alone is harm'd, 
Whilst thine the Victor is, and free.
