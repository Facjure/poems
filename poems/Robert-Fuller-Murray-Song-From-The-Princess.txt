As through the street at eve we went
 (It might be half-past ten),
We fell out, my friend and I,
About the cube of x+y,
 And made it up again.
And blessings on the falling out
 Between two learned men,
Who fight on points which neither knows,
 And make it up again!
For when we came where stands an inn
 We visit now and then,
There above a pint of beer,
Oh there above a pint of beer,
 We made it up again.
