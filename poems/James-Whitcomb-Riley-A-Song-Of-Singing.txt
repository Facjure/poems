title: A Song Of Singing
---

 Sing! gangling lad, along the brink
Of wild brook-ways of shoal and deep,
 Where killdees dip, and cattle drink,
And glinting little minnows leap!
 Sing! slimpsy lass who trips above
And sets the foot-log quivering!
 Sing! bittern, bumble-bee, and dove - 
Sing! Sing! Sing!

 Sing as you will, O singers all
Who sing because you want to sing!
 Sing! peacock on the orchard wall,
Or tree-toad by the trickling spring!
 Sing! every bird on every bough - 
Sing! every living, loving thing - 
 Sing any song, and anyhow,
But Sing! Sing! Sing!
