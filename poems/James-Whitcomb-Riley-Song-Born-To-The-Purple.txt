[W.M.]


 Most-like it was this kingly lad
 Spake out of the pure joy he had
 In his child-heart of the wee maid
 Whose eerie beauty sudden laid
 A spell upon him, and his words
 Burst as a song of any bird's: - 

 A peerless Princess thou shalt be,
 Through wit of love's rare sorcery:
 To crown the crown of thy gold hair
 Thou shalt have rubies, bleeding there
 Their crimson splendor midst the marred
 Pulp of great pearls, and afterward


 Leaking in fainter ruddy stains
 Adown thy neck-and-armlet-chains
 Of turquoise, chrysoprase, and mad
 Light-frenzied diamonds, dartling glad
 Swift spirts of shine that interfuse
 As though with lucent crystal dews
 That glance and glitter like split rays
 Of sunshine, born of burgeoning Mays
 When the first bee tilts down the lip
 Of the first blossom, and the drip
 Of blended dew and honey heaves
 Him blinded midst the underleaves.
 For raiment, Fays shall weave for thee - 
 Out of the phosphor of the sea
 And the frayed floss of starlight, spun
 With counterwarp of the firm sun - 
 A vesture of such filmy sheen
 As, through all ages, never queen
 Therewith strove truly to make less
 One fair line of her loveliness.
 Thus gowned and crowned with gems and gold,
 Thou shalt, through centuries untold,
 Rule, ever young and ever fair,
 As now thou rulest, smiling there.
