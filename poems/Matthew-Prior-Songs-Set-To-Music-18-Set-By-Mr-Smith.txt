Since we your husband daily see
So jealous out of season,
Phillis, let you and I agree
To make him so with reason.

I'm vex'd to think that every night
A sot, within thy arms,
Tasting the most divine delight,
Should sully all your charms.

While, fretting, I must lie alone,
Cursing the powers divine,
That undeservedly have thrown
A pearl unto a swine.

Then, Phillis, heal my wounded heart,
My burning passion cool;
Let me at least in thee have part
With thy insipid fool.

Let him by night his joys pursue,
And blunder in the dark,
While I by day enjoying you,
Can see to hit the mark.
