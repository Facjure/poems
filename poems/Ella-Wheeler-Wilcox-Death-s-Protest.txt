---

Why dost thou shrink from my approach, O Man?
Why dost thou ever flee in fear, and cling
To my false rival, Life?I do but bring
Thee rest and calm.Then wherefore dost thou ban
And curse me?Since the forming of God's plan
 I have not hurt or harmed a mortal thing,
 I have bestowed sweet balm for every sting,
And peace eternal for earth's stormy span.

The wild mad prayers for comfort sent in vain
 To knock at the indifferent heart of Life,
I, Death, have answered.Knowest thou not 'tis he,
My cruel rival, who sends all thy pain
 And wears the soul out in unending strife?
Why dost thou hold to him, then, spurning me?
