title: The Book Of Joyous Children

 Bound and bordered in leaf-green,
Edged with trellised buds and flowers
 And glad Summer-gold, with clean
 White and purple morning-glories
 Such as suit the songs and stories
Of this book of ours,
 Unrevised in text or scene, - 
The Book of Joyous Children.

 Wild and breathless in their glee - 
Lawless rangers of all ways
 Winding through lush greenery
 Of Elysian vales - the viny,
 Bowery groves of shady, shiny
Haunts of childish days.
 Spread and read again with me
The Book of Joyous Children.

 What a whir of wings, and what
Sudden drench of dews upon
 The young brows, wreathed, all unsought,
 With the apple-blossom garlands
 Of the poets of those far lands
Whence all dreams are drawn
 Set herein and soiling not
The Book of Joyous Children.

 In their blithe companionship
Taste again, these pages through,
 The hot honey on your lip
 Of the sun-smit wild strawberry,
 Or the chill tart of the cherry;
Kneel, all glowing, to
 The cool spring, and with it sip
The Book of Joyous Children.

 As their laughter needs no rule,
So accept their language, pray. - 
 Touch it not with any tool:
 Surely we may understand it, - 
 As the heart has parsed or scanned it
Is a worthy way,
 Though found not in any School
The Book of Joyous Children.


 Be a truant - know no place
Of prison under heaven's rim!
 Front the Father's smiling face - 
 Smiling, that you smile the brighter
 For the heavy hearts made lighter,
Since you smile with Him.
 Take - and thank Him for His grace - 
The Book of Joyous Children.
