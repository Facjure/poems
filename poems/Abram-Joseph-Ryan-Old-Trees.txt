Old trees, old trees! in your mystic gloom
 There's many a warrior laid,
And many a nameless and lonely tomb
 Is sheltered beneath your shade.
Old trees, old trees! without pomp or prayer
 We buried the brave and the true,
We fired a volley and left them there
 To rest, old trees, with you.

Old trees, old trees! keep watch and ward
 Over each grass-grown bed;
'Tis a glory, old trees, to stand as guard
 Over the Southern dead;
Old trees, old trees! we shall pass away
 Like the leaves you yearly shed,
But ye, lone sentinels, still must stay,
 Old trees, to guard "our dead".
