(Mr Norman Dewar, commission merchant, a native of Glengarry, Canada who had been assisting Captain McCabe as commissary of the Memphis Relief Committee, died of yellow fever after three days illness A brave and gentle nature, he was loved by a host of friends and will long be remembered as among the noblest of the band of gallant men who during this fearful epidemic died at the post of duty)


Far away from stricken Memphis
Came the tidings sad and sure
That among the many fallen,
Fell the clansman Norman Dewar

There are eyes unused to weeping
With the tears of sorrow dim,
Hearts with nature's anguish heaving,
Yet 'tis wrong to weep for him

None who fell in glorious battle,
In the shock of meeting steel,
Fell more bravely, died more nobly
More like son of true Lochiel

When the cry arose in Memphis
That the yellow death had come,
When the rich in fear were fleeing,
And the poor with terror dumb,

Famine following the fever,
Want of all things awful death,
When forsaken by their kindred,
Human souls gave up their breath,

There were men who felt God's pity,
Strong to do and to endure,
And among these brave and noble,
At his post stood Norman Dewar

Firm and gentle, true and tender,
Knowing all the danger well,
This true son of old Glengarry
Stood on duty till he fell

Highland hearts have breasted battle,
Highland veterans show their scars,
Highland blood has flowed like water
In our Gracious Sovereign's wars.

We have praised in song and story,
Those who bravely fought and fell,
For Old England's might and glory,
For the Queen they love so well.

And shall we this time be silent
O thou clansman firm and true,
Shall not loyal brave Glengarry,
Through her tears feel proud of you

Thou hast fought the sternest battle,
Thou hast met the grimmest foe;
Christ-like stood by the forsaken
Stood till death has laid thee low.

Praise thy sons, dear old Glengarry,
Prompt to do, calm to endure;
And among your very noblest,
Set God's hero Norman Dewar.
