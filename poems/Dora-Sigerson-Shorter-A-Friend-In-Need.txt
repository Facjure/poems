title: A Friend In Need
---

 Who has room for a friend
 Who has money to spend,
 And a goblet of gold
 For your fingers to hold,
 At the wave of whose hand
 Leap the salmon to land,
 Drop the birds of the air,
 Fall the stag and the hare.
 Who has room for a friend
 Who has money to lend?
 We have room for a friend!

 Who has room for a friend
 Who has nothing to lend,
 When the goblet of gold
 Is as far from his hold
 As the fleet-footed hare,
 Or the birds of the air.
 Who has room for a friend
 Who has nothing to spend?
 We know not such a friend.
