title: The Girl I Left Behind
---

I said: �I leave my bit of land,
In khaki they've entwined me,
I go abroad to lend a hand.�
Said she: �My love, I understand.
I will be true, and though we part
A thousand years you hold my heart",
The girl I left behind me.

I went away to fight the Huns,
No coward thought could bind me,
I sizzled n the tropic suns,
I faced the bayonets and the guns.
And when in daring deeds I shone
One little woman spurred me on,
The girl I left behind me.

Out there, in grim Gallipoli.
Hard going they assigned me,
I pricked the Turk up from the sea;
I riddled him, he punctured me;
And, bleeding in my rags, I said:
�She'll meet me somewhere if I'm dead,
The girl I left behind me.

In France we broke the German's face,
They tried with gas to blind me.
In mud we bogged from front to base,
And dirt was ours, but not disgrace.
They carved me till I couldn't stand.
Said I �Now for the Lodden, and
The girl I left behind me.

I came ashore, and struck the track;
For dust you scarce could find me.
The dear girl gave no welcome back,
Shed changed her names and state, alack!
�You've been a time, I must say, Ned,
In finishing your old war.� Said
The girl I left behind me.

I flung a song up to the skies.
For battles gods designed me.
I think of Fifi's laughing eyes,
And Nami, dusk, but sweet and wise,
And chortle in my heart to find
How very far I've left behind,
The girl I left behind me.
