title: Sonnet LXXXVI. To The Lake Of Killarney[1].
---

 Pride of Ierne's Sea-encircled bound,
Rival of all Britannia's Naiads boast,
Magnificent Killarney! - from thy coast
Tho' mountains rise with noblest woods embrown'd;
 Tho' ten-voiced Echos send the cannon's sound
In thunders bursting the vast rocks around,
Till startled Wonder and Delight exhaust
In countless repercussion - Isles embost
 Upon thy liquid glass; their bloomy veil
Sorbus and [=a]rbutus; - yet not for thee
So keenly wakes our local ecstacy,
 As o'er the narrow, barren, silent Dale,
Where deeply sleeps, rude circling Rocks among,
The Love-devoted Fount enamour'd PETRARCH sung.

1: This Sonnet was written on having read a description of the Killarney Scenery immediately after that of the Vale of Vaucluse, uncultivated and comparatively desert as the latter has been through more than the present Century.
