title: The Ass Dressed In The Lion'S Skin.

[1]

 Clad in a lion's shaggy hide,
 An ass spread terror far and wide,
 And, though himself a coward brute,
 Put all the world to scampering rout:
 But, by a piece of evil luck,
 A portion of an ear outstuck,
 Which soon reveal'd the error
 Of all the panic-terror.
 Old Martin did his office quick.
 Surprised were all who did not know the trick,
 To see that Martin,[2] at his will,
 Was driving lions to the mill!

 In France, the men are not a few
 Of whom this fable proves too true;
 Whose valour chiefly doth reside
 In coat they wear and horse they ride.
