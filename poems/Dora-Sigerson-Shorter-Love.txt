 Deep in the moving depths
Of yellow wine,
 I swore I�d drown your face,
O love of mine;
 All clad in yellow hue,
So fair to see,
 You crouched within my cup
And laughed at me.

 Twice o�er a learned page
I turned and tossed,
 For would I not forget
The love I lost.
 All stern and robed in gloom,
You read it too,
 I could not see the words-
Saw only you.

 Within the hungry chase
I thought to kill
 You, love, who haunted thus
Without my will,
 But in the gentle gaze
Of fawn and deer,
 Your eyes disarmed my hand,
And shook my spear.

 Beneath a maid�s dark lash
I swore you�d drown,
 Sink in the laughing blue-
Give in, go down:
 But no! you bath�d there
Right joyously,
 And from her liquid eyes
You laughed at me.
