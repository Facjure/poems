IX

�My lips do need thy breath,
My lips do need thy smile,
And my pallid eyne, that light in thine
Which met the stars erewhile:
Yet go with light and life
If that thou lovest one
In all the earth who loveth thee
As truly as the sun.
Margret, Margret.�


XIV

�But better loveth he
Thy chaliced wine than thy chanted song,
And better both than thee,
Margret, Margret.�



XVII

�But better loveth she
Thy golden comb than thy gathered flowers,
And better both than thee,
Margret, Margret.�


XXII

�We brake no gold, a sign
Of stronger faith to be,
But I wear his last look in my soul,
Which said, I love but thee!�
Margret, Margret.


XXVI

A knight�s bloodhound and he
The funeral watch did keep;
With a thought o� the chase he stroked its face
As it howled to see him weep.
A fair child kissed the dead,
But shrank before its cold.
And alone yet proudly in his hall
Did stand a baron of old.
Margret, Margret.
