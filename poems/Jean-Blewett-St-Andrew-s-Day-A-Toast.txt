title: St. Andrew's Day - A Toast.
---

Wha cares if skies be dull and gray?
 Wha heeds November weather?
Let ilka Scot be glad to-day
 The whole wide warl' thegither.

We're a' a prood and stubborn lot,
 And clannish - sae fowk name us - 
Ay, but with sic guid cause none ought
 Tae judge us, or tae blame us,

For joys that are we'll pledge to-day
 A land baith fair and glowing - 
Here's tae the hames o' Canada,
 Wi' luve and peace o'erflowing!

For joys that were, for auld lang syne,
 For tender chords that bind us,
A toast - your hand, auld friend, in mine - 
 "The land we left behind us!"

Ho, lowlanders! Ho, hielandmen!
 We'll toast her a' thegither,
Here's tae each bonnie loch and glen!
 Here's tae her hills and heather!

Here's tae the auld hame far away!
 While tender mists do blind us,
We'll pledge on this, St. Andrew's day,
 "The land we left behind us!"
