title: A Poet's Lesson

 Poet, my master, come, tell me true,
And how are your verses made?
 Ah! that is the easiest thing to do: - 
 You take a cloud of a silvern hue,
 A tender smile or a sprig of rue,
With plenty of light and shade,

 And weave them round in syllables rare,
With a grace and skill divine;
 With the earnest words of a pleading prayer,
 With a cadence caught from a dulcet air,
 A tale of love and a lock of hair,
Or a bit of a trailing vine.

 Or, delving deep in a mine unwrought,
You find in the teeming earth
 The golden vein of a noble thought;
 The soul of a statesman still unbought,
 Or a patriot's cry with anguish fraught
For the land that gave him birth.

 A brilliant youth who has lost his way
On the winding road of life;
 A sculptor's dream of the plastic clay;
 A painter's soul in a sunset ray;
 The sweetest thing a woman can say,
Or a struggling nation's strife.

 A boy's ambition; a maiden's star,
Unrisen, but yet to be;
 A glimmering light that shines afar
 For a sinking ship on a moaning bar;
An empty sleeve; a veteran's scar;
 Or a land where men are free.

 And if the poet's hand be strong
 To weave the web of a deathless song,
 And if a master guide the pen
 To words that reach the hearts of men,
 And if the ear and the touch be true,
 It's the easiest thing in the world to do!
