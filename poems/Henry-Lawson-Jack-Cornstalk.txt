I met with Jack Cornstalk in London to-day,
He saw me and coo-eed from over the way.
Oh! the solemn-faced Londoners stared with surprise
At his hair and his height as compared with his size!
For his trousers were short and his collar was low,
And, there�s not room to coo-ee in London, I know.

But I said to him, �Jack!� as he gripped my hand fast,
�Oh, I hear that our Country�s a nation at last!
�I hear they have launched the new ship of the State,
�And with men at the wheel who are steering it straight.
�I hear �twas the vote of your Bush mates and you;
�And, oh, tell me, Jack Cornstalk, if this can be true?

�I hear that the bitter black strike times are o�er,
�And that Grabbitt and Co. shall crush Labour no more;
�That Australians are first where Australia was last,
�And the day of the foreign adventurer�s past;
�That all things are coming we fought for so long;
�And, oh, tell me, Jack Cornstalk, if I have heard wrong?�

For a moment he dropped the old grin that he wore, 
He�d a light in his eyes that was not there before, 
And he reached for my hand, which I gave, nothing loth,
And replied in two words, and those words were �My Oath!
�They are standing up grand, Toby Barton and See,
�And Australia�s all right, you can take it from me.�
