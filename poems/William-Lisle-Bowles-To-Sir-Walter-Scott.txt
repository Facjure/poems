Since last I saw that countenance so mild,
Slow-stealing age, and a faint line of care,
Had gently touched, methought, some features there;
Yet looked the man as placid as a child,
And the same voice, whilst mingled with the throng,
Unknowing, and unknown, we passed along,
That voice, a share of the brief time beguiled!
That voice I ne'er may hear again, I sighed
At parting, wheresoe'er our various way,
In this great world, but from the banks of Tweed,
As slowly sink the shades of eventide,
Oh! I shall hear the music of his reed,
Far off, and thinking of that voice, shall say,
A blessing rest upon thy locks of gray!
