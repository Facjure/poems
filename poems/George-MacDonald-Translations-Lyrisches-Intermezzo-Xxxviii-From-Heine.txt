The phantoms of times forgotten
 Arise from out their grave,
And show me how once in thy presence
 I lived the life it gave.

In the day I wandered dreaming,
 Through the streets with unsteady foot;
The people looked at me in wonder,
 I was so mournful and mute.

At night, then it was better,
 For empty was the town;
I and my shadow together
 Walked speechless up and down.

My way, with echoing footstep,
 Over the bridge I took;
The moon broke out of the waters,
 And gave me a meaning look.

I stopped before thy dwelling,
 And gazed, and gazed again--
Stood staring up at thy window,
 My heart was in such pain.

I know that thou from thy window
 Didst often look downward--and
Sawest me, there in the moonlight,
 A motionless pillar stand.
