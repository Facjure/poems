title: Lines To Miss Chinnery, Of Gillwell-House, Upon Her Appearing In A Dress With May-Flowers And Leaves Tastefully Displayed.
---

Tell me what taught thee to display
A choice so sweet, and yet so rare,
To prize the modest buds of May
Beyond the diamond's prouder glare?

Say, was the grateful pref'rence paid
To Nature, since, with skill divine,
So many fairy charms she made,
To grace her fav'rite Caroline?

Or was it Taste that bade thee try
How soon the richest gem must yield,
In beauty and attractive die,
To this wild blossom of the field?

Whate'er the cause, in Nature's glow
Well does the choice thyself pourtray;
Thine innocence the blossoms show,
Thy youth the green leaves well display.
