Now I am dead you sing to me
 The songs we used to know,
But while I lived you had no wish
 Or care for doing so.

Now I am dead you come to me
 In the moonlight, comfortless;
Ah, what would I have given alive
 To win such tenderness!

When you are dead, and stand to me
 Not differenced, as now,
But like again, will you be cold
 As when we lived, or how?
