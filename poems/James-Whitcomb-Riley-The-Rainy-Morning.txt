title: The Rainy Morning
---

The dawn of the day was dreary,
 And the lowering clouds o'erhead
Wept in a silent sorrow
 Where the sweet sunshine lay dead;
And a wind came out of the eastward
 Like an endless sigh of pain,
And the leaves fell down in the pathway
 And writhed in the falling rain.

I had tried in a brave endeavor
 To chord my harp with the sun,
But the strings would slacken ever,
 And the task was a weary one:
And so, like a child impatient
 And sick of a discontent,
I bowed in a shower of teardrops
 And mourned with the instrument.

And lo! as I bowed, the splendor
 Of the sun bent over me,
With a touch as warm and tender
 As a father's hand might be:
And even as I felt its presence,
 My clouded soul grew bright,
And the tears, like the rain of morning,
 Melted in mists of light.
