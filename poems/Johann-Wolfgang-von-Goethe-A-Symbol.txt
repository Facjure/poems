The mason's tradeObserve them well,

Resembles life,And watch them revealing

With all its strife,How solemn feeling
Is like the stir madeAnd wonderment swell

By man on earth's face.The hearts of the brave.

Though weal and woeThe voice of the blest,

The future may hide,And of spirits on high

UnterrifiedSeems loudly to cry:
We onward go"To do what is best,

In ne'er changing race.Unceasing endeavour!

A veil of dread"In silence eterne

Hangs heavier still.Here chaplets are twin'd,

Deep slumbers fillThat each noble mind
The stars over-head,Its guerdon may earn. 

And the foot-trodden grave.Then hope ye for ever!"
