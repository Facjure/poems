A BIRTHDAY WISH.

I'm wishing a happy birthday,
To you my dear sweet friend;
And may every day be a happy day
Is the wish I will always send.


A CHRISTMAS WISH.

A Merry Christmas Wish to you,
And may your heart be gay;
May Santa bring you many things,
This Merry Christmas day.


A NEW YEAR WISH

A happy happy, New Year,
We all are wishing you;
We hope no sorrow you shall know
This whole year through.
