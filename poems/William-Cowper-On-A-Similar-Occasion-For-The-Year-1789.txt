- Placid�que ibi demum morte quievit.�Virg.


There calm at length he breathed his soul away.


�O most delightful hour by man
Experienced here below,
The hour that terminates his span,
His folly and his woe!


�Worlds should not bribe me back to tread
Again life�s dreary waste,
To see again my day o�erspread
With all the gloomy past.


�My home henceforth is in the skies,
Earth, seas, and sun, adieu!
All heaven unfolded to my eyes,
I have no sight for you.�


So spake Aspasio, firm possess�d
Of faith�s supporting rod,
Then breathed his soul into its rest,
The bosom of his God.


He was a man among the few
Sincere on virtue�s side;
And all his strength from Scripture drew,
To hourly use applied.


That rule he prized, by that he fear�d,
He hated, hoped, and loved;
Nor ever frown�d, or sad appear�d,
But when his heart had roved.


For he was frail as thou or I,
And evil felt within;
But when he felt it, heaved a sigh,
And loathed the thought of sin.


Such lived Aspasio; and at last
Call�d up from earth to heaven,
The gulf of death triumphant pass�d,
By gales of blessing driven.


His joys be mine, each reader cries,
When my last hour arrives:
They shall be yours, my verse replies,
Such only be your lives.
