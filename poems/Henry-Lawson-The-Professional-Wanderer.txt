When you�ve knocked about the country, been away from home for years;
When the past, by distance softened, nearly fills your eyes with tears, 
You are haunted oft, wherever or however you may roam,
By a fancy that you ought to go and see the folks at home.
You forget the family quarrels, little things that used to jar, 
And you think of how they�ll worry, how they wonder where you are;
You will think you served them badly, and your own part you�ll condemn,
And it strikes you that you�ll surely be a novelty to them,
For your voice has somewhat altered, and your face has somewhat changed, 
And your views of men and matters over wider fields have ranged.
Then it�s time to save your money, or to watch it (how it goes!);
Then it�s time to get a �Gladstone� and a decent suit of clothes;
Then it�s time to practise daily with a hair-brush and a comb,
Till you drop in unexpected on the folks and friends at home.
When you�ve been at home for some time, and the novelty�s worn off,
And old chums no longer court you, and your friends begin to scoff;
When �the girls� no longer kiss you, crying �Jack! how you have changed!�
When you�re stale to your relations, and their manner seems estranged ;
When the old domestic quarrels, round the table thrice a day,
Make it too much like the old times, make you wish you�d stayed away,
When, in short, you�ve spent your money in the fulness of your heart,
And your clothes are getting shabby . . . Then it�s high time to depart.
