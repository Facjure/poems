 (Foo-chow.)


 From the bright and blinding sunshine,
From the whirling locust's song,
 Into the dark and narrow fissures
Of the streets I am borne along.

 Here and there dusky-beaming
A sun-shaft broadens and drops
 On the brown bare crowd slow-passing
The crowd of the open shops.

 We move on over the bridges
With their straight-hewn blocks of stone.
 And their quaint grey animal figures,
And the booths the hucksters own.

 Behind a linen awning
Sits an ancient wight half-dead,
 And a little dear of a girl is
Examining - his head.

 On a bended bamboo shouldered,
Bearing a block of stone,
 Two worn-out coolies half-naked
Utter their grunting groan.

 Children, almond-eyed beauties,
Impossibly mangy curs,
 Take part in the motley stream of
Insouciant passengers.

 This is the dream, the vision
That comes to me and greets - 
 The vision of Retribution
In the labyrinthine streets!
