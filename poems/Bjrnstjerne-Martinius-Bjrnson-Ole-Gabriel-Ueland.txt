(See Note 46)

Of long toil 't is a matter
 Through many a silent age,
Before such power can shatter
 Time-hallowed custom's cage.
The soul-fruit of the peasant,
 Though seldom seed was sown,
It is our honor present, - 
 Our future sure foreknown.

The fjords that earnest waited
 'Mid mountain-snows around
His childhood's thoughts created
 And depth of life profound.
The highlands' sun that played there
 On fjord and mountain snow
So wide a vision made there
 As one could wish to know.

When he to Ting repairing
 Would plead the peasant's right,
Each word a beam was bearing.
 To make our young day bright.
It came like ancient story
 Or long-lost song's refrain;
What crowned our past with glory
 It made our present gain.

Though in his boat a seaman,
 A farmer in his field,
Ne'er finer thoughts did freeman
 In royal council wield.
His years bear witness ready
 That we shall yet achieve
Our people's self-rule steady,
 He taught us to believe.

When weary, worn, and aged,
 His faith was ever strong;
The people's war he wag�d
 For victory erelong.
Beneath the banner dying,
 He would not yet give o'er,
And him Valkyries flying
 Home to Valhalla bore.

From wintry night and bitter
 He was with stately tread
In Saga's hall a-glitter
 Before the high-sear led.
Old heroes proud or merry
 Rising to greet him went,
But first of all King Sverre,
 From whom was his descent.
