 As homeward by the evening star
I pass along the plain,
I see the taper's light afar,
Shine through our cottage pane.

 My brothers and my sisters dear,
The child upon the knee,
Spring when my hastening steps they hear,
And smile to welcome me.

 But when the fire is growing dim,
And mother's labours cease,
I fold my hands, repeat my hymn,
And lay me down in peace.
