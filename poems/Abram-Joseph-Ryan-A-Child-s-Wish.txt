Before an Altar



I wish I were the little key
 That locks Love's Captive in,
And lets Him out to go and free
 A sinful heart from sin.

I wish I were the little bell
 That tinkles for the Host,
When God comes down each day to dwell
 With hearts He loves the most.

I wish I were the chalice fair,
 That holds the Blood of Love,
When every flash lights holy prayer
 Upon its way above.

I wish I were the little flower
 So near the Host's sweet face,
Or like the light that half an hour
 Burns on the shrine of grace.

I wish I were the altar where,
 As on His mother's breast,
Christ nestles, like a child, fore'er
 In Eucharistic rest.

But, oh! my God, I wish the most
 That my poor heart may be
A home all holy for each Host
 That comes in love to me.
