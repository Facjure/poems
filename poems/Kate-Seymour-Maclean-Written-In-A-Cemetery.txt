Stay yet awhile, oh flowers!--oh wandering grasses,
And creeping ferns, and climbing, clinging vines;--
Bend down and cover with lush odorous masses
My darling's couch, where he in sleep reclines.

Stay yet awhile;--let not the chill October
Plant spires of glinting frost about his bed;
Nor shower her faded leaves, so brown and sober,
Among the tuberoses above his head.

I would have all things fair, and sweet, and tender,--
The daisy's pearl, the cowslip's shield of snow,
And fragrant hyacinths in purple splendour,
About my darling's grassy couch to grow.

Oh birds!--small pilgrims of the summer weather,
Come hither, for my darling loved ye well;--
Here floats the thistle down for you to gather,
And bearded grasses ripen in the dell.

Here pipe, and plume your wings, and chirp and flutter,
And swing, light-poised upon the pendant bough;--
Fondly I deem he hears the calls ye utter,
And stirs in his light sleep to answer you.

Oh wind!--that blows through hours of nights and lonely,
Oh rain!--that sobs against my window pane,--
Ye beat upon my heart, which beats but only
To clasp and shelter my lost lamb again.

Peace--peace, my soul:--I know that in another
And brighter land my darling walks and waits,
Where we shall surely meet and clasp each other,
Beyond the threshold of the shining gates.
