---

The mind, with its own eyes and ears,
 May for these others have no care;
No matter where this body is,
 The mind is free to go elsewhere.
My mind can be a sailor, when
 This body's still confined to land;
And turn these mortals into trees,
 That walk in Fleet Street or the Strand.

So, when I'm passing Charing Cross,
 Where porters work both night and day,
I ofttimes hear sweet Malpas Brook,
 That flows thrice fifty miles away.
And when I'm passing near St Paul's,
 I see, beyond the dome and crowd,
Twm Barlum, that green pap in Gwent,
 With its dark nipple in a cloud.
