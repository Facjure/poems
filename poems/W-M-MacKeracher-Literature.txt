Here is a banquet-table of delights,
 A sumptuous feast of true ambrosial food;
Here is a journey among goodly sights,
 In choice society or solitude;
Here is a treasury of gems and gold -
 Of purest gold and gems of brightest sheen;
Here is a landscape gloriously unroll'd,
 Of heights sublime and pleasant vales between.

Here is the realm of Thought, diverse and wide,
 To Genius and her sovereign sons assign'd;
The universal church, o'er which preside
 The heaven-anointed hierarchy of mind
And spirit; the imperishable pride
 And testament and promise of mankind.
