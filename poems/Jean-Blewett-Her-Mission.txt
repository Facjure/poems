title: Her Mission.
---

She is so winsome and so wise
 She sways me at her will,
And oft the question will arise,
 What mission does she fill?
O then I say with pride untold,
 And love beyond degree,
This woman with the heart of gold,
 She just keeps house for me - 
For me,
 She just keeps house for me!

A full content dwells on her face,
 She's quite in love with life,
And for a title wears with grace
 The sweet old-fashioned "wife."
Our children climb upon her knee,
 And nestle on her breast,
And ah! her mission seems to me
 The grandest and the best.

O then I say with pride untold,
 And love beyond degree,
This woman with the heart of gold,
 She just keeps house for me - 
For me,
 She just keeps house for me!
