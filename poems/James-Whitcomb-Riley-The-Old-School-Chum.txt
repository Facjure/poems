 He puts the poem by, to say
 His eyes are not themselves to-day!

 A sudden glamour o'er his sight -
 A something vague, indefinite -

 An oft-recurring blur that blinds
 The printed meaning of the lines,

 And leaves the mind all dusk and dim
 In swimming darkness - strange to him!

 It is not childishness, I guess, -
 Yet something of the tenderness

 That used to wet his lashes when
 A boy seems troubling him again; -

 The old emotion, sweet and wild,
 That drove him truant when a child,

 That he might hide the tears that fell
 Above the lesson - "Little Nell."

 And so it is he puts aside
 The poem he has vainly tried

 To follow; and, as one who sighs
 In failure, through a poor disguise

 Of smiles, he dries his tears, to say
 His eyes are not themselves to-day.
