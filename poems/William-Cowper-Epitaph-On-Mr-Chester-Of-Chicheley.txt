title: Epitaph On Mr. Chester, Of Chicheley.

Tears flow, and cease not, where the good man lies,
Till all who knew him follow to the skies.
Tears therefore fall where Chester�s ashes sleep;
Him wife, friends, brothers, children, servants weep�
And justly�few shall ever him transcend
As husband, parent, brother, master, friend.
