I hear a twittering of birds,
 And now they burst in song.
How sweet, although it wants the words!
 It shall not want them long,
For I will set some to the note
Which bubbles from the thrush's throat.

O jewelled night, that reign'st on high,
 Where is thy crescent moon?
Thy stars have faded from the sky,
 The sun is coming soon.
The summer night is passed away,
Sing welcome to the summer day.
