[R.B.]


 Whilst little Paul, convalescing, was staying
 Close indoors, and his boisterous classmates paying

Him visits, with fresh school-notes and surprises, - 
 With nettling pride they sprung the word "Athletic,"
 With much advice and urgings sympathetic
Anent "Athletic exercises." Wise as
 Lad might look, quoth Paul: "I've pondered o'er that
 'Athletic,' but I mean to take, before that,
Downstairic and outdooric exercises."
