Poltergeist activity
 - the sun winding like a staircase
onto the pavement,
rickety afternoon
shooting back thru
shawls of the city.

Tippy-toe. Curtains
ajar, a face at the cross-roads looking,
looking for all the world as
pavement stones,
greasy &amp; black, a thin
oiled compliment to
Mrs. Blight registered
at Old Inn Road.
