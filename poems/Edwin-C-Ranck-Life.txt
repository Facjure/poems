 The list is long, the stories read the same;
Strong mortal man is but a flesh-hued toy;
 Some have their ending in a life of shame;
Others drink deeply from the glass of joy;
 Some see the cup dashed dripping from their lip
Or drinking, find the wine has turned to gall,
 While others taste the sweets they fain would sip
And then Death comes--the sequel to it all.
