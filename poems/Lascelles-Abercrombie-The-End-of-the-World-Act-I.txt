ACT I

Scene: 
A public-house kitchen. HUFF the Farmer and SOLLERS the Wainwright talking; another man, a stranger, sitting silent.

Huff
 Ay, you may think we're well off -

Sollers
Now for croaks
 Old toad! who's trodden on you now? - Go on;
 But if you can, croak us a new tune.

Huff
Ay
 You think you're well off - and don't grab my words
 Before they're spoken - but some folks, I've heard,
 Pity us, living quiet in the valley.

Sollers
 Well, I suppose 'tis their affair.

Huff
Is it?
 But what I mean to say, - if they think small
 Of us that live in the valley, mayn't it show
 That we aren't all so happy as we think?

[MERRICK the smith comes in.]

Merrick
 Quick, cider! I believe I've swallowd a coal.

Sollers
 Good evening. True, the heat's a wonder tonight.[Smith draws himself cider.]

Huff
 Haven't you brought your flute? We've all got room
 For music in our minds to-night, I'll swear.
 Working all day in the sun do seem to push
 The thought out of your brain.

Sollers
O, 'tis the sun
 Had trodden on you? That's what makes you croak?
 Ay, whistle him somewhat: put a tune in his brain;
 He'll else croak us out of pleasure with drinking.

Merrick
 'Tis quenching, I believe. - A tune? Too hot?
 You want a fiddler.

Huff
Nay, I want your flute.
 I like a piping sound, not scraping o' guts.

Merrick
 This is no weather for a man to play
 Flutes or music at all that asks him spend
 His breath and spittle: you want both yourself
 These oven days. Wait till a fiddler comes.

Huff
 Who ever comes down here?

Sellers 
There's someone come.
 [Pointing with his pipe to the stranger.]

Merrick
 Good evening, mister. Are you a man for tunes?

Stranger
 And if I was I'ld give you none to-night.

Merrick
 Well, no offence: there's no offence, I hope,
 In taking a dummy for a tuneful man.
 Is it for can't or won't you are?

Stranger
 You wouldn't if you carried in your mind
 What I've been carrying all day.

Sollers
What's that?

Stranger
 You wait; you'll know about it soon; O yes,
 Soon enough it will find you and and rouse you.

Huff
 Now ain't that just the way we go down here?
 Here in the valley we're like dogs in a yard,
 Chained to our kennels and wall'd in all round,
 And not a sound of the world jumps over our hills.
 And when there comes a passenger among us,
 One who has heard what's stirring out beyond,
 'Tis a grutchy mumchance fellow in the dismals!

Stranger
 News, it it, you want? I could give you news! -
 I wonder, did you ever hate to feel
 The earth so fine and splendid?

Huff
Oh, you're one
 Has stood in the brunt of the world's wickedness,
 Like me? But listen, and I'll give you a tale
 Of wicked things done in this little valley,
 Done against me, will surely make you think
 The Devil here fetcht up his masterpiece.

Sollers
 Ah, but it's hot enough without you talking
 Your old hell fire about that pair of sinners.
 Leave them alone and drink.

Huff 
I'll smell them grilling
 One of these days.

Merrick
But there'll be nought to drink
 When that begins! Best keep your skin full now.

Stranger
 What do I care for wickedness? Let those
 Who've played with dirt, and thought the game was bold,
 Make much of it while they can: there's a big thing
 Coming down to us, ay, well on its road,
 Will make their ploys seem mighty piddling sport.

Huff
 This is a fool; or else it's what I think, -
 The world now breeds such crowd that they've no crombie room
 For well-grown sins: they hatch 'em small as flies.
 But you stay here, out of the world awhile,
 Here where a man's mind, and a woman's mind,
 Can fling out large in wickedness: you'll see
 Something monstrous here, something dreadful.

Strainger
 I've seen enough of that. Though it was only
 Fancying made me see it, it was enough;
 I've seen the folk of the world yelling aghast,
 Scurrying to hide themselves. I want nought else
 Monstrous and dreadful. -

Merrick
What had roused 'em so?
 Some house fire?

Huff 
A huzzy flogged to death
 For her hard-faced adultery?

Stranger [too intent to hear them]
Oh to think of it!
 Talk, do, chatter some nonsense, else I'll think:
 And then I'm feeling like a grub that crawls
 All abroad in a dusty road; and high
 Above me, and shaking the ground beneath me, come
 Wheels of a thundering wain, right where I'm plodding.

Sollers 
Queer thinking, that.

Stranger
And here's a queerer thing.
 I have a sort of lust in me, pushing me still
 Into that terrible way of thinking, like
 Black men in India lie them down and long
 To feel their holy wagon crack their spines.

Merrick
 Do you mean beetles? I've driven over scores,
 They sprawling on their backs, or standing mazed.
 I never knew they liked it.

Sollers
He means frogs.
 I know what's in his mind. When I was young
 My mother would catch us frogs and set them down,
 Lapt in a screw of paper, in the ruts,
 And carts going by would quash 'em; and I'ld laugh,
 And yet be thinking, ' Suppose it was myself
 Twisted stiff in huge paper, and wheels
 Bit as the wall of a barn treading me flat! '

Huff
 I know what's in his mind: just madness it is.
 He's lookt too hard at his fellows in the world;
 Sight of their monstrous hearts, like devils in cages,
 Has jolted all the gearing of his wits.
 It needs a tough brain, ay, a brain like mine,
 To pore on ugly sin and not go mad.

Stranger
 Madness! You're not far out. - I came up here
 To be alone and quiet in my thoughts
 Alone in my own dreadful mind. The path,
 Of red sand trodden hard, went up between
 High hedges overgrown of hawthorn blowing
 White as clouds; ay, it seemed burrowed through
 A white sweet-smelling cloud, - I walking there
 Small as a hare that runs its tunnelled drove
 Thro' the close heather. And beside my feet
 Blue greygles drifted gleaming over the grass;
 And up I climbed to sunlight green in birches,
 And the path turned to daisies among grass
 With bonfires of the broom beside, like flame
 Of burning straw; and I lookt into your valley.
 I could scarce look.
 Anger was smarting in my eyes like grit.
 O the fine earth and fine all for nothing!
 Mazed I walkt, seeing and smelling and hearing:
 The meadow lands all shining fearfully gold, -
 Cruel as fire the sight of them toucht my mind;
 Breathing was all a honey taste of clover
 And bean flowers: I would have rather had it
 Carrion, or the stink of smouldering brimstone.
 And larks aloft, the happy piping fools,
 And squealing swifts that slid on hissing wings,
 And yellowhammers playing spry in hedges:
 I never noted them before; but now -
 Yes, I was mad, and crying mad, to see
 The earth so fine, fine all for nothing!

Sollers [spits]
 Pst! yellowhammers! He talks gentry talk.
 That's worse than being mad.

Stranger
 I tell you, you'll be feeling them to-morn
 And hating them to be so wonderful.

Merrick
 Let's have some sense. Where do you live?

Stranger
Nowhere.
 I'm always travelling.

Huff 
Why, what's your trade?

Stranger 
A dowser.

Huff 
You're the man for me!

Stranger
Not I.

Huff
 Ho, this is better than a fiddler now!
 One of those fellows who have nerves so clever
 That they can feel the waters of underground
 Tingling in their fingers?
 You find me a spring in my high grazing-field,
 I'll give you what I save in trundling water.

Stranger
 I find you water now! - No, but I'll find you
 Fire and fear and unbelievable death.

[VINE the Publician comes in]

Vine
 Are ye all served? Ay, seems so; what's your score?

Merrick
Two ciders.

Huff
Three.

Sollers 
And two for me.

Vine [to Dowser] 
And you?

Dowser 
Naught. I was waiting on you.

Vine
Will you drink?

Dowser
 Ay! Drink! what else is left for a man to do
 Who knows what I know?

Vine
Good. What is't you know?
 You tell it out and set my trade a-buzzing.

Sollers
 He's queer. Give him his mug and ease his tongue.

Vine
 I had to swill the pigs: else I'd been here;
 But we've the old fashion in this house; you draw,
 I keep the score. Well, what's the worry on you?

Sollers
Oh he's in love.

Dowser
You fleering grinning louts,
 I'll give it you now; now have it in your faces!

Sollers
Crimini, he's going to fight!

Dowser
 You try and fight with the thing that's on my side!

Merrick
A ranter!

Huff
A boozy one then.

Dowser 
Open yon door;
 'Tis dark enough by now. Open it, you.

Vine
 Hold on. Have you got something fierce outside?

Merrick
A Russian bear?

Sollers 
Dowsers can play strange games.

Huff
No tricks!

Dowser 
This is a trick to rouse the world.

[He opens the door.]

 Look out! Between the elms! There's my fierce thing.

Merrick
 He means the star with the tail like a feather of fire.

Sollers.
Comet, it's called.

Huff
Do you mean the comet, mister?

Dowser
What do you think of it?

Huff 
Pretty enough.
 But I saw a man loose off a rocket once;
 It made more stir and flare of itself; though yon
 Does better at steady burning.

Dowser 
Stir and flare!
 You'll soon forget your rocket.

Merrick 
Tell you what
 I thought last night, now, going home. Says I,
 'Tis just like the look of a tadpole: if I saw
 A tadpole silver as a dace that swam
 Upside-down towards me through black water,
 I'ld see the plain spit of that star and his tail.

Sollers
 And how does your thought go?

Dowser 
It's what I know! -
 A tadpole and a rocket! - My dear God,
 And I can still laugh out! - What do you think
 Your tadpole's made of? What lets your rocket fling
 Those streaming sparks across the half of night,
 Splashing the burning spray of its haste among
 The quiet business of the other stars?
 Ay, that's a fiery jet it leaves behind
 In such enormous drift! What sort of fire
 Is spouted so, spouted and never quenching? -
 There is no name for that star's fire: it is
 The fire that was before the world was made,
 The fire that all the things we live among
 Remember being; and whitest fire we know
 Is its poor copy in their dreaming trance!

Huff
 That would be hell fire.

Dowser
Ay, if you like, hell fire,
 Hell fire flying through the night! 'Twould be
 A thing to blink about, a blast of it
 Swept in your face, eh? and a thing to set
 The whole stuff of the earth smoking rarely?
 Which of you said ' the heat's a wonder to-night' ?
 You have not done with marvelling. There'll come
 A night when all your clothes are a pickle of sweat,
 And, for all that, the sweat on your salty skin
 Shall dry and crack, in the breathing of wind
 That's like a draught come through an open'd furnace.
 The leafage of the trees shall brown and faint,
 All sappy growth turning to brittle rubbish
 As the near heat of the star strokes the green earth;
 And time shall brush the fields as visibly
 As a rough hand brushes against the nap
 Of gleaming cloth - killing the season's colour,
 Each hour charged with the wasting of a year;
 And sailors panting on their warping ecks
 Will watch the sea steam like broth about them.
 You'll know what I know then! - That towering star
 Hangs like a fiery buzzard in the night
 Intent over our earth - Ay, now his journey
 Points straight as a plummet's drop, down to us!

Huff
Why, that's the end of the world!

Dowser
You've said it now.

Sollers
What, soon? In a day or two?

Merrick 
You can't mean that!

Vine
 End of the World! Well now, I never thought
 To hear the news of that. If you've the truth
 In what you say, likely this is an evening
 That we'll be talking over often and often.
 'How was it, Sollers?' I'll say; ' or you, Merrick,
 Do you mind clearly how he lookt? ' - And then -
 ' " End of the world " he said, and drank - like that,
 Solemn! ' - And right he was: he had it all
 As sure as I have when my sow's to farrow.

Dowser
 Are you making a joke of me? Keep your mind
 For tippling while you can.

Vine
Was that a joke?
 I'm always bad at seeing 'em, even my own.

Dowser
 A fool's! 'Twill cheer you when the earth blows up
 Like as it were all gunpowder.

Vine
You mean
 The star will butt his burning head against us?
 'Twill knock the world to flinders, I suppose?

Dowser
 Ay, or with that wild, monstrous tail of his
 Smash down upon the air, and make it bounce
 Like water under the flukes of a harpooned whale,
 And thrash it to a poisonous fire; and we
 And all the life of the world drowned in blazing!

Vine
 'Twill be a handsone sight. If my old wife
 Were with me now! This would have suited her.
 'I do like things to happen!' she would say;
 Never shindy enough for her; and now
 She's gone, and can't be seeing this!

Dowser 
You poor fool.
 How will it be a sight to you, when your eyes
 Are scorcht to little cinders in your head?

Vine
 Whether or no, there must be folks outside
 Willing to know of this. I'll scatter your news.

[He goes. A short pause: then SOLLERS breaks out.]

Sollers
 No, no; it woudn't do for me at all;
 Nor for you neither, Merrick? End of the World?
 Bogy! A parson's tale or a bairn's!

Merrick
That's it.
 Your trade's a gift, easy as playing tunes.
 But Sollers here and I, we've had to drill
 Sinew and muscle into their hard lesson,
 Until they work in timber and flowing iron
 As kindly as I pick up my pint: your work
 Grows in your nature, like plain speech in a child,
 But we have learnt to think in a foreign tongue;
 And something must come out of all our skill!
 We shan't go sliding down as glib as you
 Into notions of the End of the World.

Sollers
 Give me a tree, you may say, and give me steel,
 And I'll put forth my shapely mind; I'll make,
 Out of my head like telling a well-known tale,
 A wain that goes as comely on the roads
 As a ship sailing, the lines of it true as gospel.
 Have I learnt that all for nothing? - O no!
 End of the World? It wouldn't do at all.
 No more making of wains, after I've spent
 My time in getting the right skill in my hands?

Dowser
 Ay, you begin to feel it now, I think;
 But you complain like boys for a game spoilt:
 Shaping your carts, forging your iron! But Life,
 Life, the mother who lets her children play
 So seriously busy, trade and craft, -
 Life with her skill of a million years' perfection
 To make her heart's delighted glorying
 Of sunlight, and of clouds about the moon,
 Spring lighting her daffodils, and corn
 Ripening gold to ruddy, and giant seas,
 And mountains sitting in their purple clothes -
 O life I am thinking of, life the wonder,
 All blotcht out by a brutal thrust of fire
 Like a midge that clumsy thumb squashes and smears.

Huff
 Let me but see the show beginning, though!
 You'ld mind me then! O I would like you all
 To watch how I should figure, when the star
 Brandishes over the whole air its flame
 Of thundering fire; and naught but yellow rubbish
 Parcht on the perishing ground, and there are tongues
 Chapt with thirst, glad to lap stinking ponds,
 And pale glaring faces spying about
 On the earth withering, terror the only speech!
 Look for me then, and see me stand alone
 Easy and pleasant in the midst of it all.
 Did you not make your merry scoff of me?
 Was it your talk, that when you shameless pair
 Threw their wantoning in my face like dirt,
 I had no heart against them but to grumble?
 You would be saying that, I know! But now,
 Now I believe it's time for you to see
 My patient heart at last taking its wages.

Sollers
 Pull up, man! Screw the brake on your running tongue,
 Else it will rattle you down the tumbling way
 This fellow's gone.

Merrick
And one man's enough
 With brain quagged axle-deep in crazy mire.
 We won't have you beside him in his puddles,
 And calling out with him on the End of the World
 To heave you out with a vengeance.

Huff
What you want!
 Have I not borne enough to make me know
 I must be righted sometime? - And what else
 Would break the hardy sin in them, which lets
 Their souls parade so daring and so tall
 Under God's hate and mine? What else could pay
 For all my wrong but a blow of blazing anger
 Striking down to shiver the earth, and change
 Their strutting wickedness to horror and crying?

Merrick
 Be quiet, Huff! If you mean to believe
 This dowser's stuff, and join in his bedlam,
 By God, you'll have to reckon with my fist.

[SHALE comes in. HUFF glares at him speechless, but with wrath evidently working.]

Shale
 Where's the joker? You, is it? Here's hot news
 You've brought us; all the valley's hissing aloud,
 And makes as much of you falling into it
 As a pail of water would of a glowing coal.

Sollers
 Don't you start burbling too, Shale.

Shale
That's the word!
 Burbling, simmering, ay, and bumpy-boiling :
 All the women are mobbed together close
 Under the witan-trees, and their full minds
 Boil like so many pans slung on a fire.
 Why starlings trooping in a copse in fall
 Could make no scandal like it.

Merrick
What is it, man?

Shale
 End of the World! The flying star! End of the World!

Sollers
They don't believe it though?

Shale
 What? the whole place
 Has gone just randy over it!

Merrick
Hold your noise!

Sollers
I shall be daft if this goes on.

Shale
Ay, so?
 The End of the World's been here? You look as though
 You'd startled lately. And there's the virtuous man!
 How would End of the World suit our good Huff,
 Our old crab-verjuice Huff?

HUFF [seizing the DOWSER and bring him up in front of Shale]
Look at him there!
 This is the man I told of when you
 Were talking small of sin. You made it out,
 Did you, a fool's mere nasty game, like dogs
 That snuggle in muck, and grin and roll themselves
 With snorting pleasure? Ah, but you are wrong.
 'Tis something that goes thrusting dreadfully
 Its wilful bravery of evil against
 The worth and right of goodness in the world:
 Ay, do you see how his face still brags at me?
 And long it has been, the time he's had to walk
 Lording about me with his wickedness.
 Do you know what he dared? I had a wife,
 A flighty pretty linnet-headed girl,
 But mine: he practised on her with his eyes;
 He knew of luring glances, and she went
 After his calling lust: and all since then
 They've lived together, fleering in my face,
 Pleased in sight of the windows of my house
 With doing wrong, and making my disgrace.
 O but wait here with me; wait till your news
 Is not to be mistaken, for the way
 The earth buckles and singes like hot boards:
 You'll surely see how dreadful sin can be
 Then, when you mark these two running about,
 With raging fear for what they did against me
 Buzzing close to their souls, stinging their hearts,
 And they like scampering beasts when clegs are fierce,
 Or flinging themselves low as the ground to writhe,
 Their arms hugging their desperate heads. And then
 You'll see what 'tis to be an upright man,
 Who keeps a patient anger for his wrongs
 Thinking of judgment coming - you will see that
 When you mark how my looks hunt these wretches,
 And smile upon their groans and posturing anguish.
 O watch how calm I'll be, when the blazing air
 Judges their wickedness; you watch me then
 Looking delighted, like a nobleman
 Who sees his horse winning an easy race.

Merrick
 You fool, Huff, you believe it now!

Huff
You fool,
 Merrick, how should I not believe a thing
 That calls aloud on my mind and spirit, and they
 Answer to it like starving conquering soldiers
 Told to break out and loot?

Shale
You vile old wasp!

Sollers
 We've talkt enough: let's all go home and sleep;
 There might be a fiend in the air about us, one
 Who pours his will into our minds to see
 How we can frighten one another.
Huff
A fiend!
 Shale will soon have the flapping wings of a fiend,
 And flaming wings, beating about his head.
 Ther'll be no air for Shale, very soon now,
 But the breathing of a fiend: the star's coming!
 The star that breathes a horrible fury of fire
 Like glaring fog into the empty night;
 And in the gust of its wrath the world will soon
 Shrivel and spin like paper in a furnace.
 I knew they both would have to pay me at last
 With sight of their damned souls for all my wrong!

Shale
Somebody stop his gab.

Merrick [seizing the DOWSER and shaking him]
 Is it the truth we're in the way of the star?

A crowd of men and women burst in and shout confusedly.
 1. Look out for the star!
2. 'Tis moving, moving.
 3. Grows as you stare at it.
4. Bigger than ever.
 1. Down it comes with a diving pounce,
 As though it had lookt for us and at last found us.
 2. O so near and coming so quick!
 3. And how the buring hairs of its tail
 Do seem surely to quiver for speed.
 4. We saw its great tail gwitch behind it.
 'Tis come so near, so gleaming near.
 1. The tail is wagging!
2. Come out and see!
 3. The star is wagging its tail and eyeing us -
 4. Like a cat huncht to leap on a bird.

Merrick
 Out of my way and let me see for myself.

[They all begin to hustle out: HUFF speaks in midst of the turmoil.]

Huff
 Ay, now begins the just man's reward;
 And hatred of the evil thing
 Now is to be satisfied.
 Wrong ventured out against me and braved:
 And I'll be glad to see all breathing pleasure
 Burn as foolishly to naught
 As a moth in candle flame,
 If I but have my will to watch over those
 Who injured me bawling hoarse heartless fear.

[They are all gone but HUFF, SHALE and the DOWSER.]

Shale
 As for you, let you and the women make
 Your howling scare of this; I'll stand and laugh.
 But if it truly were the End of the World,
 I'ld be the man to face it out, not you:
 I who have let life go delighted through me,
 Not you, who've sulkt away your chance of life
 In mumping about being paid for goodness.

[Going.]

Huff [after him]
 You wait, you wait!

[He follows the rest. ]

Dowser [alone] 
Naught but a plague of flies!
 I cannot do with noises, and light fools
 Terrified round me; I must go out and think
 Where there is quiet and no one near. O, think!
 Life that has done such wonders with its thinking,
 And never daunted in imagining;
 That has put on the sun and the shining night,
 The flowering of the earth and tides of the sea,
 And irresistible rage of fate itself,
 All these as garments for its spirit's journey -
 O now this life, in the brute chance of things,
 Murder'd, uselessly murder'd! And naught else
 For ever but senseless rounds of hurrying motion
 That cannot glory in itself. O no!
 I will not think of that; I'll blind my brain
 With fancying the splendours of destruction;
 When like a burr in the star's fiery mane
 The crackling earth is caught and rusht along,
 The forests on the mountains blazing so,
 That from the rocks of ore beneath them come
 White-hot rivers of smelted metal pouring
 Across the plains to roar into the sea. . . .

The curtain is lowered for a few moments only.
