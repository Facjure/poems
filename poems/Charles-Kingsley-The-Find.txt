 Yon sound's neither sheep-bell nor bark,
 They're running - they're running, Go hark!
 The sport may be lost by a moment's delay;
 So whip up the puppies and scurry away.
Dash down through the cover by dingle and dell,
There's a gate at the bottom - I know it full well;
And they're running - they're running,
 Go hark!

 They're running - they're running, Go hark!
 One fence and we're out of the park;
 Sit down in your saddles and race at the brook,
 Then smash at the bullfinch; no time for a look;
Leave cravens and skirters to dangle behind;
He's away for the moors in the teeth of the wind,
And they're running - they're running,
 Go hark!

 They're running - they're running, Go hark!
 Let them run on and run till it's dark!
 Well with them we are, and well with them we'll be,
 While there's wind in our horses and daylight to see:
Then shog along homeward, chat over the fight,
And hear in our dreams the sweet music all night
Of - They're running - they're running,
 Go hark!

Eversley, 1856.
