A little black thing among the snow:
Crying weep, weep, in notes of woe!
Where are thy father &amp; mother? say?
They are both gone up to the church to pray.

Because I was happy upon the heath.
And smilï¿½d among the winters snow:
They clothed me in the clothes of death.
And taught me to sing the notes of woe.

And because I am happy. &amp; dance &amp; sing.
They think they have done me no injury:
And are gone to praise God &amp; his Priest &amp; King,
Who made up a heaven of our misery.
