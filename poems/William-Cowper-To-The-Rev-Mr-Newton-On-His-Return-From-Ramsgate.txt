That ocean you have late survey�d,
Those rocks I too have seen;
But I, afflicted and dismay�d,
You, tranquil and serene.


You from the flood-controlling steep
Saw stretch�d before your view,
With conscious joy, the threatening deep,
No longer such to you.


To me the waves, that ceaseless broke
Upon the dangerous coast,
Hoarsely and ominously spoke
Of all my treasure lost.


Your sea of troubles you have past,
And found the peaceful shore;
I, tempest-toss�d, and wreck�d at last,
Come home to port no more.
