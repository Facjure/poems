Evening comes with moonshine and silky darkness.
The roads become weary.The narrow world widens.
Winds of opium move in and out of the field.

I feel as though my body were the whole earth.
The city lights up: thousands of street lamps sway.
Now the sky also piously enkindles its candlelight.
...Huge above everything my human face wanders -
