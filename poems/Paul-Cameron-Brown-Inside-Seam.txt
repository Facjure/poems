1

Having wilderness cracks
in emotional facades
chinks within
to let cabins in.

2
Porous wind
examining pavement,
foot-sore maybe loose
winding entrails
of our hearts
into lavatory paper;
would that it pleased
riddled trees
 - more whistling,
poked holes
across oasis tracks
wandering spaces.

3
Blistering thought,
paint flecks
chipped in the mica-afraid
heat of wan-ton passion;
(acknowledging debts to Chinese cuisine)
a wan smile
left from which
I pretend to remember all.

4
Love-smitten
to lend
the reach of your arm - 
sighs,
droop to
hips heaving
a droll verandah
(like curtain's edge
across the exhausted wall).

5
Besmirched stain,
The lavender hoop
of your belt is a winding lizard's skin
or perspiring rope
to anchor the filmy edge
of letters written,
not sent.

The breeze,
quiet wind - 
a chipmunk
with woodchips
poked into a grin.
