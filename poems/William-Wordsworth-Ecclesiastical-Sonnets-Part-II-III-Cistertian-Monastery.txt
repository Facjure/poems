 "Here Man more purely lives, less oft doth fall,
 "More promptly rises, walks with stricter heed,
 "More safely rests, dies happier, is freed
 "Earlier from cleansing fires, and gains withal
 "A brighter crown." On yon Cistertian wall
 'That' confident assurance may be read;
 And, to like shelter, from the world have fled
 Increasing multitudes. The potent call
 Doubtless shall cheat full oft the heart's desires;
 Yet, while the rugged Age on pliant knee
 Vows to rapt Fancy humble fealty,
 A gentler life spreads round the holy spires;
 Where'er they rise, the sylvan waste retires,
 And aery harvests crown the fertile lea.
