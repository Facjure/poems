ON A TREE COMMANDING A VIEW OF THE WHOLE EXTENT OF BOWOOD.

 When in thy sight another's vast domain
 Spreads its long line of woods, dost thou complain?
 Nay, rather thank the God that placed thy state
 Above the lowly, but beneath the great!
 And still His name with gratitude revere,
 Who blessed the Sabbath of thy leisure here.

ON A RURAL SEAT.

 Rest, stranger, in this decorated scene,
 That hangs its beds of flowers, its slopes so green;
 So from the walks of life the weeds remove,
 But fix thy better hopes on scenes above.

ON THE FRONT OF A HERMITAGE, NEAR A DIAL.

 To mark life's few and fleeting hours
 I placed the dial 'midst the flowers,
 Which one by one came forth and died,
 Still withering by its ancient side.
 Mortals, let the sight impart
 Its pensive moral to thy heart!

QUIETI ET MUSIS.

 Be thine Retirement's peaceful joys,
 And a life that makes no noise;
 Save when Fancy, musing long,
 Wakes her desultory song;
 Sounding to the vacant ear,
 Like the rill that murmurs near.
