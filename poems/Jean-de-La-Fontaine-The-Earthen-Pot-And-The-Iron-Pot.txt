title: The Earthen Pot And The Iron Pot.

[1]

 An iron pot proposed
 To an earthen pot a journey.
 The latter was opposed,
 Expressing the concern he
 Had felt about the danger
 Of going out a ranger.
 He thought the kitchen hearth
 The safest place on earth
 For one so very brittle.
 'For thee, who art a kettle,
 And hast a tougher skin,
 There's nought to keep thee in.'
 'I'll be thy body-guard,'
 Replied the iron pot;
 'If anything that's hard
 Should threaten thee a jot,
 Between you I will go,
 And save thee from the blow.'
 This offer him persuaded.
 The iron pot paraded
 Himself as guard and guide
 Close at his cousin's side.
 Now, in their tripod way,
 They hobble as they may;
 And eke together bolt
 At every little jolt, - 
 Which gives the crockery pain;
 But presently his comrade hits
 So hard, he dashes him to bits,
 Before he can complain.

 Take care that you associate
 With equals only, lest your fate
 Between these pots should find its mate.
