 Long hosts of sunlight, and the bright wind blows
 A tourney trumpet on the listed hill:
 Past is the splendor of the royal rose
 And duchess daffodil.

 Crowned queen of beauty, in the garden's space,
 Strong daughter of a bitter race and bold,
 A ragged beggar with a lovely face,
 Reigns the sad marigold.

 And I have sought June's butterfly for days,
 To find it, like a coreopsis bloom,
 Amber and seal, rain-murdered 'neath the blaze
 Of this sunflower's plume.

 Here basks the bee; and there, sky-voyaging wings
 Dare God's blue gulfs of heaven; the last song,
 The red-bird flings me as adieu, still rings
 Upon yon pear-tree's prong.

 No angry sunset brims with rosier red
 The bowl of heaven than the days, indeed,
 Pour in each blossom of this salvia-bed,
 Where each leaf seems to bleed.

 And where the wood-gnats dance, a tiny mist,
 Above the efforts of the weedy stream,
 The girl, October, tired of the tryst,
 Dreams a diviner dream.

 One foot just dipping the caressing wave,
 One knee at languid angle; locks that drown
 Hands nut-stained; hazel-eyed, she lies, and grave,
 Watching the leaves drift down.
