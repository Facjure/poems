title: Raptures
---

Sing for the sun your lyric, lark,
 Of twice ten thousand notes;
Sing for the moon, you nightingales,
 Whose light shall kiss your throats;
Sing, sparrows, for the soft warm rain,
 To wet your feathers through;
And when a rainbow's in the sky,
 Sing you, cuckoo - Cuckoo!

Sing for your five blue eggs, fond thrush,
 By many a leaf concealed;
You starlings, wrens, and blackbirds, sing
 In every wood and field:
While I, who fail to give my love
 Long raptures twice as fine,
Will for her beauty breathe this one -
 A sigh, that's more divine.
