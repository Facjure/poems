---

 She went along the road,
Her baby in her arms.
The night and its alarms
 Made deadlier her load.

 Her shrunken breasts were dry;
She felt the hunger bite.
She lay down in the night,
 She and the child, to die.

 But it would wail, and wail,
And wail. She crept away.
She had no word to say,
 Yet still she heard the wail.

 She took a jagged stone;
She wished it to be dead.
She beat it on the head;
 It only gave one moan.

 She has no word to say;
She sits there in the night.
The east sky glints with light,
 And it is Christmas Day!
