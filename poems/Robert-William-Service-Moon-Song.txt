 A child saw in the morning skies
 The dissipated-looking moon,
 And opened wide her big blue eyes,
 And cried: "Look, look, my lost balloon!"
 And clapped her rosy hands with glee:
 "Quick, mother! Bring it back to me."

 A poet in a lilied pond
 Espied the moon's reflected charms,
 And ravished by that beauty blonde,
 Leapt out to clasp her in his arms.
 And as he'd never learnt to swim,
 Poor fool! that was the end of him.

 A rustic glimpsed amid the trees
 The bluff moon caught as in a snare.
 "They say it do be made of cheese,"
 Said Giles, "and that a chap bides there. . . .
 That Blue Boar ale be strong, I vow - 
 The lad's a-winkin' at me now."

 Two lovers watched the new moon hold
 The old moon in her bright embrace.
 Said she: "There's mother, pale and old,
 And drawing near her resting place."
 Said he: "Be mine, and with me wed,"
 Moon-high she stared . . . she shook her head.

 A soldier saw with dying eyes
 The bleared moon like a ball of blood,
 And thought of how in other skies,
 So pearly bright on leaf and bud
 Like peace its soft white beams had lain;
 Like Peace! . . . He closed his eyes again.

 Child, lover, poet, soldier, clown,
 Ah yes, old Moon, what things you've seen!
 I marvel now, as you look down,
 How can your face be so serene?
 And tranquil still you'll make your round,
 Old Moon, when we are underground.
