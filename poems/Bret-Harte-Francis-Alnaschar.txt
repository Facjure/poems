Here�s yer toy balloons! All sizes!
Twenty cents for that. It rises
Jest as quick as that �ere, Miss,
Twice as big. Ye see it is
Some more fancy. Make it square
Fifty for �em both. That�s fair.

That�s the sixth I�ve sold since noon.
Trade�s reviving. Just as soon
As this lot�s worked off, I�ll take
Wholesale figgers. Make or break,
That�s my motto! Then I�ll buy
In some first-class lottery
One half ticket, numbered right
As I dreamed about last night.

That�ll fetch it. Don�t tell me!
When a man�s in luck, you see,
All things help him. Every chance
Hits him like an avalanche.
Here�s your toy balloons, Miss. Eh?
You won�t turn your face this way?
Mebbe you�ll be glad some day.
With that clear ten thousand prize
This �yer trade I�ll drop, and rise
Into wholesale. No! I�ll take
Stocks in Wall Street. Make or break,
That�s my motto! With my luck,
Where�s the chance of being stuck?
Call it sixty thousand, clear,
Made in Wall Street in one year.

Sixty thousand! Umph! Let�s see!
Bond and mortgage�ll do for me.
Good! That gal that passed me by
Scornful like why, mebbe I
Some day�ll hold in pawn why not?
All her father�s prop. She�ll spot
What�s my little game, and see
What I�m after�s her. He! he!

He! he! When she comes to sue
Let�s see! What�s the thing to do?
Kick her? No! There�s the perliss!
Sorter throw her off like this.
Hello! Stop! Help! Murder! Hey!
There�s my whole stock got away,
Kiting on the house-tops! Lost!
All a poor man�s fortin! Cost?
Twenty dollars! Eh! What�s this?
Fifty cents! God bless ye, Miss!
