 Fair inmate of these ivied walls, beneath
 Whose silent cloisters Ella sleeps in death,
 Let loftier bards, in rich and glowing lays,
 Thy gentleness, thy grace, thy virtue praise!
 Be mine to breathe one prayer; when all rejoice,
 One parting prayer, still mindful of that voice,
 And musing on the sacred song which stole,
 Sweet as the spell of peace, upon the soul;
 In those same scenes, where once the chapel dim
 Echoed the cloistered sisters' vesper hymn: - 
 Live long! live happy! tranquil through the strife
 And the loud stir of this tumultuous life!
Live long, live happy! and when many a day
 Hath passed in the heart's harmony away;
 When Eve's pale hand the gates of life shall close,
 And hush the landscape to its last repose;
 May sister seraphs meet with welcome song,
 And gently say, Why have you stayed so long?
