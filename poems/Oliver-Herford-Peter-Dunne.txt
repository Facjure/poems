By the Harp

"Shpeaking of Harps, sure me frind Pete
 Has got the Harp of Tara beat,"
 Said Mr. Dooley. "Div'l a thing
 That boy can't play upon won shtring.
 For all the wurrld, to hear him play
 You'd think 'twas a whole orchestray.
 Great Shtatesmen come from far and near
 And shtop their talking, just to hear
 Him harp upon the latest kinks
 In politics and social jinks.
 Niver was such a music sharp,
 I'd orter know, sure I'm the Harp."
