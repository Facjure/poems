What was it filled my youthful dreams,
In place of Greek or Latin themes,
Or beauty�s wild, bewildering beams?
Avitor!

What visions and celestial scenes
I filled with aerial machines,
Montgolfier�s and Mr. Green�s!
Avitor!

What fairy tales seemed things of course!
The roc that brought Sindbad across,
The Calendar�s own winged horse!
Avitor!

How many things I took for facts,
Icarus and his conduct lax,
And how he sealed his fate with wax!
Avitor!

The first balloons I sought to sail,
Soap-bubbles fair, but all too frail,
Or kites, but thereby hangs a tail.
Avitor!

What made me launch from attic tall
A kitten and a parasol,
And watch their bitter, frightful fall?
Avitor!

What youthful dreams of high renown
Bade me inflate the parson�s gown,
That went not up, nor yet came down?
Avitor!

My first ascent I may not tell;
Enough to know that in that well
My first high aspirations fell.
Avitor!

My other failures let me pass:
The dire explosions, and, alas!
The friends I choked with noxious gas.
Avitor!

For lo! I see perfected rise
The vision of my boyish eyes,
The messenger of upper skies.
Avitor!
