 How can I wait until you come to me?
 The once fleet mornings linger by the way,
 Their sunny smiles touched with malicious glee
 At my unrest; they seem to pause, and play
 Like truant children, while I sigh and say,
How can I wait?

 How can I wait? Of old, the rapid hours
Refused to pause or loiter with me long;
 But now they idly fill their hands with flowers,
 And make no haste, but slowly stroll among
 The summer blooms, not heeding my one song,
How can I wait?

 How can I wait? The nights alone are kind;
 They reach forth to a future day, and bring
 Sweet dreams of you to people all my mind;
 And time speeds by on light and airy wing.
 I feast upon your face, I no more sing,
How can I wait?

 How can I wait? The morning breaks the spell
 A pitying night has flung upon my soul.
 You are not near me, and I know full well
 My heart has need of patience and control;
 Before we meet, hours, days, and weeks must roll.
How can I wait?

 How can I wait? Oh, love, how can I wait
 Until the sunlight of your eyes shall shine
 Upon my world that seems so desolate?
 Until your hand-clasp warms my blood like wine;
 Until you come again, oh, love of mine,
How can I wait?
