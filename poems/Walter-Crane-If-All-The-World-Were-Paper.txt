title: If All The World Were Paper

1

If all the world were paper,
And all the sea were ink,
And all the trees were bread and cheese,
What should we do for drink?

2

If all the world were sand--O!
Oh, then what should we lack--O!
If, as they say, there were no clay,
How should we take tobacco?

3

If all our vessels ran-a,
If none but had a crack,
If Spanish apes ate all the grapes,
How should we do for sack?
