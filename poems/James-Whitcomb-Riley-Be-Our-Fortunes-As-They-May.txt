title: Be Our Fortunes As They May
---

 Be our fortunes as they may,
Touched with loss or sorrow,
 Saddest eyes that weep to-day
May be glad to-morrow.

 Yesterday the rain was here,
And the winds were blowing -
 Sky and earth and atmosphere
Brimmed and overflowing.

 But to-day the sun is out,
And the drear November
 We were then so vexed about
Now we scarce remember.

 Yesterday you lost a friend -
Bless your heart and love it! -
 For you scarce could comprehend
All the aching of it; -

 But I sing to you and say:
Let the lost friend sorrow -
 Here's another come to-day,
Others may to-morrow.
