"What's the good of going to Ridgeway,
 Cerne, or Sydling Mill,
 Or to Yell'ham Hill,
Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way
 As we used to do?
She will no more climb up there,
Or be visible anywhere
 In those haunts we knew."

But to-night, while walking weary,
 Near me seemed her shade,
 Come as 'twere to upbraid
This my mood in deeming dreary
 Scenes that used to please;
And, if she did come to me,
Still solicitous, there may be
 Good in going to these.

So, I'll care to roam to Ridgeway,
 Cerne, or Sydling Mill,
 Or to Yell'ham Hill,
Blithely bearing Casterbridge-way
 As we used to do,
Since her phasm may flit out there,
And may greet me anywhere
 In those haunts we knew.

April 1913.
