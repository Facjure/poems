O God, whose favourable eye
The sin-sick soul revives,
Holy and heavenly is the joy
Thy shining presence gives.


Not such as hypocrites suppose,
Who with a graceless heart
Taste not of thee, but drink a dose,
Prepared by Satan�s art.


Intoxicating joys are theirs,
Who, while they boast their light,
And seem to soar above the stars,
Are plunging into night.


Lull�d in a soft and fatal sleep,
They sin, and yet rejoice;
Were they indeed the Saviour�s sheep,
Would they not hear his voice?


Be mine the comforts that reclaim
The soul from Satan�s power;
That make me blush for what I am,
And hate my sin the more.


�Tis joy enough, my All in All,
At thy dear feet to lie;
Thou wilt not let me lower fall,
And none can higher fly.
