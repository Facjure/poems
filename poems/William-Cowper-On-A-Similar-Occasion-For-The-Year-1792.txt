Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,
Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum
Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari!�Virg.


Happy the mortal who has traced effects
To their first cause, cast fear beneath his feet
And death and roaring hell�s voracious fires!


Thankless for favours from on high,
Man thinks he fades too soon;
Though �tis his privilege to die,
Would he improve the boon.


But he, not wise enough to scan
His blest concerns aright,
Would gladly stretch life�s little span
To ages, if he might.


To ages in a world of pain,
To ages, where he goes
Gall�d by affliction�s heavy chain,
And hopeless of repose.


Strange fondness of the human heart,
Enamour�d of its harm!
Strange world, that costs it so much smart,
And still has power to charm!


Whence has the world her magic power?
Why deem we death a foe?
Recoil from weary life�s best hour,
And covet longer woe?


The cause is Conscience�Conscience oft
Her tale of guilt renews:
Her voice is terrible though soft,
And dread of death ensues.


Then anxious to be longer spared,
Man mourns his fleeting breath:
All evils then seem light, compared
With the approach of death.


�Tis judgment shakes him: there�s the fear
That prompts the wish to stay:
He has incurr�d a long arrear,
And must despair to pay.


Pay!�follow Christ, and all is paid;
His death your peace ensures;
Think on the grave where He was laid,
And calm descend to yours.
