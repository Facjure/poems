(See Note 1)

Yes, we love this land that towers
 Where the ocean foams;
Rugged, storm-swept, it embowers
 Many thousand homes.
Love it, love it, of you thinking,
 Father; mother dear,
And that night of saga sinking
 Dreamful to us here.

This the land that Harald guarded
 With his hero-throng,
This the land that Haakon warded,
 Hailed by Eyvind's song.
Olaf here the cross erected,
 While his blood he shed;
Sverre's word this land protected
 'Gainst the Roman dread.

Peasants whetted axes carried,
 Broke th' invader's blow;
Tordenskjold flashed forth and harried,
 Lighted home the foe.
Women oft to arms were leaping,
 Manlike in their deed;
Others' lot was naught but weeping,
 Tears that brought their meed.

Many truly were we never,
 But we did suffice,
When in times of testing ever
 Worthy was the prize.
For we would the land see burning,
 Rather than its fall;
Memory our thoughts is turning
 Down to Fredrikshald!

Harder times we bore that tried us
 Were cast off in scorn;
In that crisis was beside us
 Blue-eyed freedom born.
That gave father-strength for bearing
 Famine-need and sword,
Honor death itself outwearing,
 And it gave accord.

Far our foe his weapons flinging
 Up his visor raised;
We in wonder to him springing
 On our brother gazed.
Both by wholesome shame incited
 Southward made our way;
Brothers three, in heart united,
 We shall stand for aye!

Men of Norway, high or lowly,
 Give to God the praise!
He our land's Defender Holy
 In its darkest days!
All our fathers here have striven
 And our mothers wept,
Hath the Lord His guidance given,
 So our right we kept.

Yes, we love this land that towers
 Where the ocean foams;
Rugged, storm-swept, it embowers
 Many thousand homes.
As our fathers' conflict gave it
 Vict'ry at the end,
Also we, when time shall crave it,
 Will its peace defend.
