Little honey baby, shet yo' eyes up tight; - 
 (Shadow-man is comin' from de moon!) - 
You's as sweet as roses if dey is so pink an white;
 (Shadow-man '11 get here mighty soon.)

Little honey baby, keep yo' footses still! - 
 (Rocky-bye, oh, rocky, rocky-bye!)
Hush yo' now, an listen to dat lonesome whippo'-will;
 Don't yo' fix yo' lip an start to cry.

Little honey baby, stop dat winkin' quick!;
 (Hear de hoot-owl in de cotton-wood!)
Yess - I sees yo' eyes adoin' dat dere triflin' trick - 
 (He gets chillun if dey isn't good.)

Little honey baby, what yo' think yo' see? - 
 (Sister keep on climbin' to de sky - )
Dat's a June bug - it aint got no stinger, lak a bee - 
 (Reach de glory city by an by.)

Little honey baby, what yo' skeery at? - 
 (Go down, Moses - down to Phar-e-oh,) - 
No - dat isn't nuffin but a furry fly-round bat; - 
 (Say, he'd betta let dose people go.)

Little honey baby, yo' is all ma own, - 
 Deed yo' is. - Yes, - dat's a fia-fly; - 
If I didn't hab yo' - reckon I'd be all alone;
 (Rocky-bye - oh, rocky, rocky-bye.)

Little honey baby, shet yo' eyes up tight; - 
 (Shadow man is comin' from de moon,)
You's as sweet as roses, if dey is so pink and white;
 (Shadow-man '11 get here mighty soon.)


 The lines in brackets are supposed to be sung or chanted.
 The Southern "Mammy" seldom sang a song through, but interladed it with comments. - V.S.
