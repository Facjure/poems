Would you believe in Presences Unseen - 
 In life beyond this earthly life?
BE STILL:Be stiller yet; and listen.Set the screen
 Of silence at the portal of your will.
Relax, and let the world go by unheard.
And seal your lips with some all-sacred word.

Breathe 'God,' in any tongue - it means the same;
 LOVE ABSOLUTE:Think, feel, absorb the thought;
Shut out all else; until a subtle flame
 (A spark from God's creative centre caught)
Shall permeate your being, and shall glow,
Increasing in its splendour, till, YOU KNOW.

Not in a moment, or an hour, or day
 The knowledge comes; the power is far too great,
To win in any desultory way.
 No soul is worthy till it learns to wait.
Day after day be patient, then, oh, soul;
Month after month - till, lo! the goal! the goal!
