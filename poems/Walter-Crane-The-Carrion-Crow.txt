1

A carrion crow sat on an oak,
Derry, derry, derry, decco;
A carrion crow sat on an oak,
Watching a tailor shaping his cloak.
Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,
Derry, derry, derry, decco.

2 

"O wife, bring me my old bent bow,"
Derry, derry, derry, decco;
"O wife, bring me my old bent bow,
"That I may shoot yon carrion crow."
Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,
Derry, derry, derry, decco.

3 

The tailor shot, and he missed his mark,
Derry, derry, derry, decco;
The tailor shot, and he missed his mark,
And shot his old sow right through the heart
Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,
Derry, derry, derry, decco.

4 

"O wife, bring brandy in a spoon,"
Derry, derry, derry, decco;
"O wife, bring brandy in a spoon,
"For our old sow is in a swoon."
Heigh-ho! the carrion crow,
Derry, derry, derry, decco.
