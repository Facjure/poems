title: If This Great World Of Joy And Pain
---

 If this great world of joy and pain
 Revolve in one sure track;
 If freedom, set, will rise again,
 And virtue, flown, come back;
 Woe to the purblind crew who fill
 The heart with each day's care;
 Nor gain, from past or future, skill
 To bear, and to forbear!
