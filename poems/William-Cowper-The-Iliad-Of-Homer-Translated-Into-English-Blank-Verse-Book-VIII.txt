 Argument Of The Eighth Book.


Jove calls a council, in which he forbids all interference of the Gods between the Greeks and Trojans. He repairs to Ida, where, having consulted the scales of destiny, he directs his lightning against the Grecians. Nestor is endangered by the death of one of his horses. Diomede delivers him. In the chariot of Diomede they both hasten to engage Hector, whose charioteer is slain by Diomede. Jupiter again interposes by his thunders, and the whole Grecian host, discomfited, is obliged to seek refuge within the rampart. Diomede, with others, at sight of a favorable omen sent from Jove in answer to Agamemnon's prayer, sallies. Teucer performs great exploits, but is disabled by Hector. Juno and Pallas set forth from Olympus in aid of the Grecians, but are stopped by Jupiter, who reascends from Ida, and in heaven foretells the distresses which await the Grecians.

Hector takes measures for the security of Troy during the night, and prepares his host for an assault to be made on the Grecian camp in the morning.



 The saffron-mantled morning[1] now was spread
 O'er all the nations, when the Thunderer Jove
 On the deep-fork'd Olympian topmost height
 Convened the Gods in council, amid whom
 He spake himself; they all attentive heard.
 Gods! Goddesses! Inhabitants of heaven!
 Attend; I make my secret purpose known.
 Let neither God nor Goddess interpose
 My counsel to rescind, but with one heart
 Approve it, that it reach, at once, its end.
 Whom I shall mark soever from the rest
 Withdrawn, that he may Greeks or Trojans aid,
 Disgrace shall find him; shamefully chastised
 He shall return to the Olympian heights,
 Or I will hurl him deep into the gulfs
 Of gloomy Tartarus, where Hell shuts fast
 Her iron gates, and spreads her brazen floor,
 As far below the shades, as earth from heaven.
 There shall he learn how far I pass in might
 All others; which if ye incline to doubt,
 Now prove me. Let ye down the golden chain[2]
 From heaven, and at its nether links pull all,
 Both Goddesses and Gods. But me your King,
 Supreme in wisdom, ye shall never draw
 To earth from heaven, toil adverse as ye may.
 Yet I, when once I shall be pleased to pull,
 The earth itself, itself the sea, and you
 Will lift with ease together, and will wind
 The chain around the spiry summit sharp
 Of the Olympian, that all things upheaved
 Shall hang in the mid heaven. So far do I,
 Compared with all who live, transcend them all.
 He ended, and the Gods long time amazed
 Sat silent, for with awful tone he spake:
 But at the last Pallas blue-eyed began.
 Father! Saturnian Jove! of Kings supreme!
 We know thy force resistless; but our hearts
 Feel not the less, when we behold the Greeks
 Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot.
 If thou command, we, doubtless, will abstain
 From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks
 Suggesting still, as may in part effect
 Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all.
 To whom with smiles answer'd cloud-gatherer Jove.
 Fear not, my child! stern as mine accent was,
 I forced a frown--no more. For in mine heart
 Nought feel I but benevolence to thee.
 He said, and to his chariot join'd his steeds
 Swift, brazen-hoof'd, and mailed with wavy gold;
 He put on golden raiment, his bright scourge
 Of gold receiving rose into his seat,
 And lash'd his steeds; they not unwilling flew
 Midway the earth between and starry heaven.
 To spring-fed Ida, mother of wild beasts,
 He came, where stands in Gargarus[3] his shrine
 Breathing fresh incense! there the Sire of all
 Arriving, loosed his coursers, and around
 Involving them in gather'd clouds opaque,
 Sat on the mountain's head, in his own might
 Exulting, with the towers of Ilium all
 Beneath his eye, and the whole fleet of Greece.
 In all their tents, meantime, Achaia's sons
 Took short refreshment, and for fight prepared.
 On the other side, though fewer, yet constrain'd
 By strong necessity, throughout all Troy,
 In the defence of children and wives
 Ardent, the Trojans panted for the field.
 Wide flew the city gates: forth rush'd to war
 Horsemen and foot, and tumult wild arose.
 They met, they clash'd; loud was the din of spears
 And bucklers on their bosoms brazen-mail'd
 Encountering, shields in opposition from
 Met bossy shields, and tumult wild arose.[4]
 There many a shout and many a dying groan
 Were heard, the slayer and the maim'd aloud
 Clamoring, and the earth was drench'd with blood.
 'Till sacred morn[5] had brighten'd into noon,
 The vollied weapons on both sides their task
 Perform'd effectual, and the people fell.
 But when the sun had climb'd the middle skies,
 The Sire of all then took his golden scales;[6]
 Doom against doom he weigh'd, the eternal fates
 In counterpoise, of Trojans and of Greeks.
 He rais'd the beam; low sank the heavier lot
 Of the Achaians; the Achaian doom
 Subsided, and the Trojan struck the skies.
 Then roar'd the thunders from the summit hurl'd
 of Ida, and his vivid lightnings flew
 Into Achaia's host. They at the sight
 Astonish'd stood; fear whiten'd every cheek.[7]
 Idomeneus dared not himself abide
 That shock, nor Agamemnon stood, nor stood
 The heroes Ajax, ministers of Mars.
 Gerenian Nestor, guardian of the Greeks,
 Alone fled not, nor he by choice remain'd,
 But by his steed retarded, which the mate
 Of beauteous Helen, Paris, with a shaft
 Had stricken where the forelock grows, a part
 Of all most mortal. Tortured by the wound
 Erect he rose, the arrow in his brain,
 And writhing furious, scared his fellow-steeds.
 Meantime, while, strenuous, with his falchion's edge
 The hoary warrior stood slashing the reins,
 Through multitudes of fierce pursuers borne
 On rapid wheels, the dauntless charioteer
 Approach'd him, Hector. Then, past hope, had died
 The ancient King, but Diomede discern'd
 His peril imminent, and with a voice
 Like thunder, called Ulysses to his aid.
 Laertes' noble son, for wiles renown'd!
 Art thou too fugitive, and turn'st thy back
 Like the base multitude? Ah! fear a lance
 Implanted ignominious in thy spine.
 Stop--Nestor dies. Fell Hector is at hand.
 So shouted Diomede, whose summons loud,
 Ulysses yet heard not, but, passing, flew
 With headlong haste to the Achaian fleet.
 Then, Diomede, unaided as he was,
 Rush'd ardent to the vanward, and before
 The steeds of the Neleian sovereign old
 Standing, in accents wing'd, him thus address'd.
 Old Chief! these youthful warriors are too brisk
 For thee, press'd also by encroaching age,
 Thy servant too is feeble, and thy steeds
 Are tardy. Mount my chariot. Thou shalt see
 With what rapidity the steeds of Troy,
 Pursuing or retreating, scour the field.
 I took them from that terror of his foes,
 �neas. Thine to our attendants leave,
 While these against the warlike powers of Troy
 We push direct; that Hector's self may know
 If my spear rage not furious as his own.
 He said, nor the Gerenian Chief refused.
 Thenceforth their servants, Sthenelus and good
 Eurymedon, took charge of Nestor's steeds,
 And they the chariot of Tydides both
 Ascended; Nestor seized the reins, plied well
 The scourge, and soon they met. Tydides hurl'd
 At Hector first, while rapid he advanced;
 But missing Hector, wounded in the breast
 Eniopeus his charioteer, the son
 Of brave Theb�us, managing the steeds.
 He fell; his fiery coursers at the sound
 Startled, recoil'd, and where he fell he died.
 Deep sorrow for his charioteer o'erwhelm'd
 The mind of Hector; yet, although he mourn'd
 He left him, and another sought as brave.
 Nor wanted long his steeds a charioteer,
 For finding soon the son of Iphitus,
 Bold Archeptolemus, he bade him mount
 His chariot, and the reins gave to his hand.
 Then deeds of bloodiest note should have ensued,
 Penn'd had the Trojans been, as lambs, in Troy,

 But for quick succor of the sire of all.
 Thundering, he downward hurled his candent bolt
 To the horse-feet of Diomede; dire fumed
 The flaming sulphur, and both horses drove
 Under the axle, belly to the ground.
 Forth flew the splendid reins from Nestor's hand,
 And thus to Diomede, appall'd, he spake.
 Back to the fleet, Tydides! Can'st not see
 That Jove ordains not, now, the victory thine?
 The son of Saturn glorifies to-day
 This Trojan, and, if such his will, can make
 The morrow ours; but vain it is to thwart
 The mind of Jove, for he is Lord of all.
 To him the valiant Diomede replied.
 Thou hast well said, old warrior! but the pang
 That wrings my soul, is this. The public ear
 In Ilium shall from Hector's lips be told--
 I drove Tydides--fearing me he fled.
 So shall he vaunt, and may the earth her jaws
 That moment opening swallow me alive!
 Him answer'd the Gerenian warrior old.
 What saith the son of Tydeus, glorious Chief?
 Should Hector so traduce thee as to call
 Thee base and timid, neither Trojan him
 Nor Dardan would believe, nor yet the wives
 Of numerous shielded warriors brave of Troy,
 Widow'd by thy unconquerable arm.
 So saying, he through the fugitives his steeds
 Turn'd swift to flight. Then Hector and his host
 With clamor infinite their darts wo-wing'd
 Shower'd after them, and Hector, mighty Chief
 Majestic, from afar, thus call'd aloud.
 Tydides! thee the Dana� swift-horsed
 Were wont to grace with a superior seat,
 The mess of honor, and the brimming cup,
 But now will mock thee. Thou art woman now.
 Go, timorous girl! Thou never shalt behold
 Me flying, climb our battlements, or lead
 Our women captive. I will slay thee first.
 He ceased. Then Diomede in dread suspense
 Thrice purposed, turning, to withstand the foe,
 And thrice in thunder from the mountain-top
 Jove gave the signal of success to Troy.
 When Hector thus the Trojans hail'd aloud.
 Trojans and Lycians, and close-warring sons
 Of Dardanus, oh summon all your might,
 Now, now be men! I know that from his heart
 Saturnian Jove glory and bright success
 For me prepares, but havoc for the Greeks.
 Fools! they shall find this wall which they have raised
 Too weak to check my course, a feeble guard
 Contemptible; such also is the trench;
 My steeds shall slight it with an easy leap.
 But when ye see me in their fleet arrived,
 Remember fire. Then bring me flaming brands
 That I may burn their galleys and themselves
 Slaughter beside them, struggling in the smoke.[8]
 He spake, and thus encouraged next his steeds.
 Xanthus! Podargus! and ye generous pair
 �thon and glossy Lampus! now requite
 Mine, and the bounty of Andromache,
 Far-famed E�tion's daughter; she your bowl
 With corn fresh-flavor'd and with wine full oft
 Hath mingled, your refreshment seeking first
 Ere mine, who have a youthful husband's claim.[9]
 Now follow! now be swift; that we may seize
 The shield of Nestor, bruited to the skies
 As golden all, trappings and disk alike.
 Now from the shoulders of the equestrian Chief
 Tydides tear we off his splendid mail,
 The work of Vulcan.[10] May we take but these,
 I have good hope that, ere this night be spent,
 The Greeks shall climb their galleys and away.
 So vaunted he, but Juno with disdain
 His proud boast heard, and shuddering in her throne,
 Rock'd the Olympian; turning then toward
 The Ocean's mighty sovereign, thus she spake.
 Alas! earth-shaking sovereign of the waves,
 Feel'st thou no pity of the perishing Greeks?
 Yet Greece, in Helice, with gifts nor few
 Nor sordid, and in �g�, honors thee,
 Whom therefore thou shouldst prosper. Would we all
 Who favor Greece associate to repulse
 The Trojans, and to check loud-thundering Jove,
 On Ida seated he might lour alone.
 To whom the Sovereign, Shaker of the Shores,
 Indignant. Juno! rash in speech! what word
 Hath 'scaped thy lips? never, with my consent,
 Shall we, the powers subordinate, in arms
 With Jove contend. He far excels us all.
 So they. Meantime, the trench and wall between,[11]
 The narrow interval with steeds was fill'd
 Close throng'd and shielded warriors. There immew'd
 By Priameian Hector, fierce as Mars,
 They stood, for Hector had the help of Jove.
 And now with blazing fire their gallant barks
 He had consumed, but Juno moved the mind
 Of Agamemnon, vigilant himself,
 To exhortation of Achaia's host.
 Through camp and fleet the monarch took his way,
 And, his wide robe imperial in his hand,
 High on Ulysses' huge black galley stood,
 The central ship conspicuous; thence his voice
 Might reach the most remote of all the line
 At each extreme, where Ajax had his tent
 Pitch'd, and Achilles, fearless of surprise.
 Thence, with loud voice, the Grecians thus he hail'd.
 Oh shame to Greece! Warriors in show alone!
 Where is your boasted prowess? Ye profess'd
 Vain-glorious erst in Lemnos, while ye fed
 Plenteously on the flesh of beeves full-grown,
 And crown'd your beakers high, that ye would face
 Each man a hundred Trojans in the field--
 Ay, twice a hundred--yet are all too few
 To face one Hector now; nor doubt I aught
 But he shall soon fire the whole fleet of Greece.
 Jove! Father! what great sovereign ever felt
 Thy frowns as I? Whom hast thou shamed as me?
 Yet I neglected not, through all the course
 Of our disasterous voyage (in the hope
 That we should vanquish Troy) thy sacred rites,
 But where I found thine altar, piled it high
 With fat and flesh of bulls, on every shore.
 But oh, vouchsafe to us, that we at least
 Ourselves, deliver'd, may escape the sword,
 Nor let their foes thus tread the Grecians down!
 He said. The eternal father pitying saw
 His tears, and for the monarch's sake preserved
 The people. Instant, surest of all signs,
 He sent his eagle; in his pounces strong
 A fawn he bore, fruit of the nimble hind,
 Which fast beside the beauteous altar raised
 To Panomph�an[12] Jove sudden he dropp'd.[13]
 They, conscious, soon, that sent from Jove he came,
 More ardent sprang to fight. Then none of all
 Those numerous Chiefs could boast that he outstripp'd
 Tydides, urging forth beyond the foss
 His rapid steeds, and rushing to the war.
 He, foremost far, a Trojan slew, the son
 Of Phradmon, Agel�us; as he turn'd
 His steeds to flight, him turning with his spear
 Through back and bosom Diomede transpierced.
 And with loud clangor of his arms he fell.
 Then, royal Agamemnon pass'd the trench
 And Menelaus; either Ajax, then,
 Clad with fresh prowess both; them follow'd, next,
 Idomeneus, with his heroic friend
 In battle dread as homicidal Mars,
 Meriones; Ev�mon's son renown'd
 Succeeded, bold Eurypylus; and ninth
 Teucer, wide-straining his impatient bow.
 He under covert fought of the broad shield
 Of Telamonian Ajax; Ajax high
 Upraised his shield; the hero from beneath
 Took aim, and whom his arrow struck, he fell;
 Then close as to his mother's side a child
 For safety creeps, Teucer to Ajax' side
 Retired, and Ajax shielded him again.
 Whom then slew Teucer first, illustrious Chief?
 Orsilochus, and Ophelestes, first,
 And Ormenus he slew, then D�tor died,
 Chromius and Lycophontes brave in fight
 With Amopaon Poly�mon's son,
 And Melanippus. These, together heap'd,
 All fell by Teucer on the plain of Troy.
 The Trojan ranks thinn'd by his mighty bow
 The King of armies Agamemnon saw
 Well-pleased, and him approaching, thus began.
 Brave Telamonian Teucer, oh, my friend,
 Thus shoot, that light may visit once again
 The Dana�, and Telamon rejoice!
 Thee Telamon within his own abode
 Rear'd although spurious; mount him, in return,
 Although remote, on glory's heights again.
 I tell thee, and the effect shall follow sure,
 Let but the Thunderer and Minerva grant
 The pillage of fair Ilium to the Greeks,
 And I will give to thy victorious hand,
 After my own, the noblest recompense,
 A tripod or a chariot with its steeds,
 Or some fair captive to partake thy bed.
 To whom the generous Teucer thus replied.
 Atrides! glorious monarch! wherefore me
 Exhortest thou to battle? who myself
 Glow with sufficient ardor, and such strength
 As heaven affords me spare not to employ.
 Since first we drove them back, with watchful eye
 Their warriors I have mark'd; eight shafts my bow
 Hath sent long-barb'd, and every shaft, well-aim'd.
 The body of some Trojan youth robust
 Hath pierced, but still you ravening wolf escapes.
 He said, and from the nerve another shaft
 Impatient sent at Hector; but it flew
 Devious, and brave Gorgythion struck instead.
 Him beautiful Castianira, brought
 By Priam from �syma, nymph of form
 Celestial, to the King of Ilium bore.
 As in the garden, with the weight surcharged
 Of its own fruit, and drench'd by vernal rains
 The poppy falls oblique, so he his head
 Hung languid, by his helmet's weight depress'd.[14]
 Then Teucer yet an arrow from the nerve
 Dispatch'd at Hector, with impatience fired
 To pierce him; but again his weapon err'd
 Turn'd by Apollo, and the bosom struck
 Of Archeptolemus, his rapid steeds
 To battle urging, Hector's charioteer.
 He fell, his fiery coursers at the sound
 Recoil'd, and lifeless where he fell he lay.
 Deep sorrow for his charioteer the mind
 O'erwhelm'd of Hector, yet he left the slain,
 And seeing his own brother nigh at hand,
 Cebriones, him summon'd to the reins,
 Who with alacrity that charge received.
 Then Hector, leaping with a dreadful shout
 From his resplendent chariot, grasp'd a stone,
 And rush'd on Teucer, vengeance in his heart.
 Teucer had newly fitted to the nerve
 An arrow keen selected from the rest,
 And warlike Hector, while he stood the cord
 Retracting, smote him with that rugged rock
 Just where the key-bone interposed divides
 The neck and bosom, a most mortal part.
 It snapp'd the bow-string, and with numbing force
 Struck dead his hand; low on his knees he dropp'd,
 And from his opening grasp let fall the bow.
 Then not unmindful of a brother fallen
 Was Ajax, but, advancing rapid, stalk'd
 Around him, and his broad shield interposed,
 Till brave Alaster and Mecisteus, son
 Of Echius, friends of Teucer, from the earth
 Upraised and bore him groaning to the fleet.
 And now again fresh force Olympian Jove
 Gave to the Trojans; right toward the foss
 They drove the Greeks, while Hector in the van
 Advanced, death menacing in every look.
 As some fleet hound close-threatening flank or haunch
 Of boar or lion, oft as he his head
 Turns flying, marks him with a steadfast eye,
 So Hector chased the Grecians, slaying still
 The hindmost of the scatter'd multitude.
 But when, at length, both piles and hollow foss
 They had surmounted, and no few had fallen
 By Trojan hands, within their fleet they stood
 Imprison'd, calling each to each, and prayer
 With lifted hands, loud offering to the Gods.
 With Gorgon looks, meantime, and eyes of Mars,
 Hector impetuous his mane-tossing steeds
 From side to side before the rampart drove,
 When white-arm'd Juno pitying the Greeks,
 In accents wing'd her speech to Pallas turn'd.
 Alas, Jove's daughter! shall not we at least
 In this extremity of their distress
 Care for the Grecians by the fatal force
 Of this one Chief destroy'd? I can endure
 The rage of Priame�an Hector now
 No longer; such dire mischiefs he hath wrought.
 Whom answer'd thus Pallas, c�rulean-eyed.
 --And Hector had himself long since his life
 Resign'd and rage together, by the Greeks
 Slain under Ilium's walls, but Jove, my sire,
 Mad counsels executing and perverse,
 Me counterworks in all that I attempt,
 Nor aught remembers how I saved ofttimes
 His son enjoin'd full many a task severe
 By King Eurystheus; to the Gods he wept,
 And me Jove sent in haste to his relief.
 But had I then foreseen what now I know,
 When through the adamantine gates he pass'd
 To bind the dog of hell, by the deep floods
 Hemm'd in of Styx, he had return'd no more.
 But Thetis wins him now; her will prevails,
 And mine he hates; for she hath kiss'd his knees
 And grasp'd his beard, and him in prayer implored
 That he would honor her heroic son
 Achilles, city-waster prince renown'd.
 'Tis well--the day shall come when Jove again
 Shall call me darling, and his blue-eyed maid
 As heretofore;--but thou thy steeds prepare,
 While I, my father's mansion entering, arm
 For battle. I would learn by trial sure,
 If Hector, Priam's offspring famed in fight
 (Ourselves appearing in the walks of war)
 Will greet us gladly. Doubtless at the fleet
 Some Trojan also, shall to dogs resign
 His flesh for food, and to the fowls of heaven.
 So counsell'd Pallas, nor the daughter dread
 Of mighty Saturn, Juno, disapproved,
 But busily and with dispatch prepared
 The trappings of her coursers golden-rein'd.
 Meantime, Minerva progeny of Jove,
 On the adamantine floor of his abode
 Let fall profuse her variegated robe,
 Labor of her own hands. She first put on
 The corslet of the cloud-assembler God,
 Then arm'd her for the field of wo, complete.
 Mounting the fiery chariot, next she seized
 Her ponderous spear, huge, irresistible,
 With which Jove's awful daughter levels ranks
 Of heroes against whom her anger burns.
 Juno with lifted lash urged on the steeds.
 At their approach, spontaneous roar'd the wide-
 Unfolding gates of heaven; the heavenly gates
 Kept by the watchful Hours, to whom the charge
 Of the Olympian summit appertains,
 And of the boundless ether, back to roll,
 And to replace the cloudy barrier dense.
 Spurr'd through the portal flew the rapid steeds:
 Which when the Eternal Father from the heights
 Of Ida saw, kindling with instant ire
 To golden-pinion'd Iris thus he spake.
 Haste, Iris, turn them thither whence they came;
 Me let them not encounter; honor small
 To them, to me, should from that strife accrue.
 Tell them, and the effect shall sure ensue,
 That I will smite their steeds, and they shall halt
 Disabled; break their chariot, dash themselves
 Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface
 The wounds by my avenging bolts impress'd.
 So shall my blue-eyed daughter learn to dread
 A father's anger; but for the offence
 Of Juno, I resent it less; for she
 Clashes[15] with all my counsels from of old.
 He ended; Iris with a tempest's speed
 From the Id�an summit soar'd at once
 To the Olympian; at the open gates
 Exterior of the mountain many-valed
 She stayed them, and her coming thus declared.
 Whither, and for what cause? What rage is this?
 Ye may not aid the Grecians; Jove forbids;
 The son of Saturn threatens, if ye force
 His wrath by perseverance into act,
 That he will smite your steeds, and they shall halt
 Disabled; break your chariot, dash yourselves
 Headlong, and ten whole years shall not efface
 The wounds by his avenging bolts impress'd.
 So shall his blue-eyed daughter learn to dread
 A father's anger; but for the offence
 Of Juno, he resents it less; for she
 Clashes with all his counsels from of old.
 But thou, Minerva, if thou dare indeed
 Lift thy vast spear against the breast of Jove,
 Incorrigible art and dead to shame.
 So saying, the rapid Iris disappear'd,
 And thus her speech to Pallas Juno turn'd.
 Ah Pallas, progeny of Jove! henceforth
 No longer, in the cause of mortal men,
 Contend we against Jove. Perish or live
 Grecians or Trojans as he wills; let him
 Dispose the order of his own concerns,
 And judge between them, as of right he may.
 So saying, she turn'd the coursers; them the Hours
 Released, and to ambrosial mangers bound,
 Then thrust their chariot to the luminous wall.
 They, mingling with the Gods, on golden thrones
 Dejected sat, and Jove from Ida borne
 Reach'd the Olympian heights, seat of the Gods.
 His steeds the glorious King of Ocean loosed,
 And thrust the chariot, with its veil o'erspread.
 Into its station at the altar's side.
 Then sat the Thunderer on his throne of gold
 Himself, and the huge mountain shook. Meantime
 Juno and Pallas, seated both apart,
 Spake not or question'd him. Their mute reserve
 He noticed, conscious of the cause, and said.
 Juno and Pallas, wherefore sit ye sad?
 Not through fatigue by glorious fight incurr'd
 And slaughter of the Trojans whom ye hate.
 Mark now the difference. Not the Gods combined
 Should have constrain'd me back, till all my force,
 Superior as it is, had fail'd, and all
 My fortitude. But ye, ere ye beheld
 The wonders of the field, trembling retired.
 And ye did well--Hear what had else befallen.
 My bolts had found you both, and ye had reach'd,
 In your own chariot borne, the Olympian height,
 Seat of the blest Immortals, never more.
 He ended; Juno and Minerva heard
 Low murmuring deep disgust, and side by side
 Devising sat calamity to Troy.
 Minerva, through displeasure against Jove,
 Nought utter'd, for her bosom boil'd with rage;
 But Juno check'd not hers, who thus replied.
 What word hath pass'd thy lips, Jove most severe?
 We know thy force resistless; yet our hearts
 Feel not the less when we behold the Greeks
 Exhausting all the sorrows of their lot.
 If thou command, we doubtless will abstain
 From battle, yet such counsel to the Greeks
 Suggesting still, as may in part effect
 Their safety, lest thy wrath consume them all.
 Then answer, thus, cloud-gatherer Jove return'd.
 Look forth, imperial Juno, if thou wilt,
 To-morrow at the blush of earliest dawn,
 And thou shalt see Saturn's almighty son
 The Argive host destroying far and wide.
 For Hector's fury shall admit no pause
 Till he have roused Achilles, in that day
 When at the ships, in perilous straits, the hosts
 Shall wage fierce battle for Patroclus slain.
 Such is the voice of fate. But, as for thee--
 Withdraw thou to the confines of the abyss
 Where Saturn and I�petus retired,
 Exclusion sad endure from balmy airs
 And from the light of morn, hell-girt around,
 I will not call thee thence. No. Should thy rage
 Transport thee thither, there thou may'st abide,
 There sullen nurse thy disregarded spleen
 Obstinate as thou art, and void of shame.
 He ended; to whom Juno nought replied.
 And now the radiant Sun in Ocean sank,
 Drawing night after him o'er all the earth;
 Night, undesired by Troy, but to the Greeks
 Thrice welcome for its interposing gloom.
 Then Hector on the river's brink fast by
 The Grecian fleet, where space he found unstrew'd
 With carcases convened the Chiefs of Troy.
 They, there dismounting, listen'd to the words
 Of Hector Jove-beloved; he grasp'd a spear
 In length eleven cubits, bright its head
 Of brass, and color'd with a ring of gold.
 He lean'd on it, and ardent thus began.
 Trojans, Dardanians, and allies of Troy!
 I hoped, this evening (every ship consumed,
 And all the Grecians slain) to have return'd
 To wind-swept Ilium. But the shades of night
 Have intervened, and to the night they owe,
 In chief, their whole fleet's safety and their own.
 Now, therefore, as the night enjoins, all take
 Needful refreshment. Your high-mettled steeds
 Release, lay food before them, and in haste
 Drive hither from the city fatted sheep
 And oxen; bring ye from your houses bread,
 Make speedy purchase of heart-cheering wine,
 And gather fuel plenteous; that all night,
 E'en till Aurora, daughter of the morn
 Shall look abroad, we may with many fires
 Illume the skies; lest even in the night,
 Launching, they mount the billows and escape.
 Beware that they depart not unannoy'd,
 But, as he leaps on board, give each a wound
 With shaft or spear, which he shall nurse at home.
 So shall the nations fear us, and shall vex
 With ruthless war Troy's gallant sons no more.
 Next, let the heralds, ministers of Jove,
 Loud notice issue that the boys well-grown,
 And ancients silver-hair'd on the high towers
 Built by the Gods, keep watch; on every hearth
 In Troy, let those of the inferior sex
 Make sprightly blaze, and place ye there a guard
 Sufficient, lest in absence of the troops
 An ambush enter, and surprise the town.
 Act thus, ye dauntless Trojans; the advice
 Is wholesome, and shall serve the present need,
 And so much for the night; ye shall be told
 The business of the morn when morn appears.
 It is my prayer to Jove and to all heaven
 (Not without hope) that I may hence expel
 These dogs, whom Ilium's unpropitious fates
 Have wafted hither in their sable barks.
 But we will also watch this night, ourselves,
 And, arming with the dawn, will at their ships
 Give them brisk onset. Then shall it appear
 If Diomede the brave shall me compel
 Back to our walls, or I, his arms blood-stain'd,
 Torn from his breathless body, bear away.
 To-morrow, if he dare but to abide
 My lance, he shall not want occasion meet
 For show of valor. But much more I judge
 That the next rising sun shall see him slain
 With no few friends around him. Would to heaven!
 I were as sure to 'scape the blight of age
 And share their honors with the Gods above,
 As comes the morrow fraught with wo to Greece.
 So Hector, whom his host with loud acclaim
 All praised. Then each his sweating steeds released,
 And rein'd them safely at his chariot-side.
 And now from Troy provision large they brought,
 Oxen, and sheep, with store of wine and bread,
 And fuel much was gather'd. [16]Next the Gods
 With sacrifice they sought, and from the plain
 Upwafted by the winds the smoke aspired
 Savoury, but unacceptable to those
 Above; such hatred in their hearts they bore
 To Priam, to the people of the brave
 Spear-practised Priam, and to sacred Troy.
 Big with great purposes and proud, they sat,
 Not disarray'd, but in fair form disposed
 Of even ranks, and watch'd their numerous fires,
 As when around the clear bright moon, the stars
 Shine in full splendor, and the winds are hush'd,
 The groves, the mountain-tops, the headland-heights
 Stand all apparent, not a vapor streaks
 The boundless blue, but ether open'd wide
 All glitters, and the shepherd's heart is cheer'd;[17]
 So numerous seem'd those fires the bank between
 Of Xanthus, blazing, and the fleet of Greece,
 In prospect all of Troy; a thousand fires,
 Each watch'd by fifty warriors seated near.
 The steeds beside the chariots stood, their corn
 Chewing, and waiting till the golden-throned
 Aurora should restore the light of day.
