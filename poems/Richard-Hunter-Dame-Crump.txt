Some dolls are ev'ry bit as good
As little girls and boys;
They never pout or shake themselves,
And never make a noise.

But other dollies make mistakes;
Won't do as they are told;
Won't stand upright, or shut their eyes,
However much you scold!

And then's the time for old Dame Crump
To enter with her stick,
And make them mind their p's and q's;
'Tis well if they are quick!
