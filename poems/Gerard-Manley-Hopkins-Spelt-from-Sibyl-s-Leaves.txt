Earnest, earthless, equal, attuneable, | vaulty, voluminous, . . stupendous
Evening strains to be t�me's v�st, | womb-of-all, home-of-all, hearse-of-all night.
Her fond yellow hornlight wound to the west, | her wild hollow hoarlight hung to the height
Waste; her earliest stars, earl-stars, | st�rs principal, overbend us,
F�re-f�aturing heaven. For earth | her being has unbound, her dapple is at an end, as- tray or aswarm, all throughther, in throngs; | self �n self steep�d and pashed - q�ite
Disremembering, d�smembering | �ll now. Heart, you round me right
With: �ur �vening is over us; �ur night | wh�lms, wh�lms, �nd will end us.
Only the beak-leaved boughs dragonish | damask the tool-smooth bleak light; black,
Ever so black on it. �ur tale, �ur oracle! | L�t life, w�ned, ah l�t life wind
Off h�r once sk�ined stained v�ined var�ety | upon, �ll on tw� spools; p�rt, pen, p�ck
Now her �ll in tw� flocks, tw� folds - black, white; | right, wrong; reckon but, reck but, mind
But th�se two; w�re of a w�rld where b�t these | tw� tell, each off the �ther; of a rack
Where, selfwrung, selfstrung, sheathe- and shelterless, | th�ughts aga�nst thoughts �n groans gr�nd.
