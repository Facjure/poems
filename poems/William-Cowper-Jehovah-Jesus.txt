My song shall bless the Lord of all,
My praise shall climb to his abode;
Thee, Saviour, by that name I call,
The great Supreme, the mighty God.


Without beginning or decline,
Object of faith, and not of sense;
Eternal ages saw him shine,
He shines eternal ages hence.


As much, when in the manger laid,
Almighty ruler of the sky,
As when the six days� works he made
Fill�d all the morning stars with joy.


Of all the crowns Jehovah bears,
Salvation is his dearest claim;
That gracious sound well pleased he hears,
And owns Emmanuel for his name.


A cheerful confidence I feel,
My well-placed hopes with joy I see;
My bosom glows with heavenly zeal,
To worship him who died for me.


As man, he pities my complaint,
His power and truth are all divine;
He will not fail, he cannot faint,
Salvation�s sure, and must be mine.
