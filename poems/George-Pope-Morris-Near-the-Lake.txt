title: Near the Lake.

Near the lake where drooped the willow,
Long time ago!--
Where the rock threw back the billow
Brighter than snow--
Dwelt a maid, beloved and cherished
By high and low;
But with autumn's leaf she perished,
Long time ago!

Rock and tree and flowing water,
Long time ago!--
Bee and bird and blossom taught her
Love's spell to know!
While to my fond words she listened,
Murmuring low,
Tenderly her dove-eyes glistened,
Long time ago!

Mingled were our hearts for ever,
Long time ago!
Can I now forget her?--Never!
No--lost one--no!
To her grave these tears are given,
Ever to flow:
She's the star I missed from heaven,
Long time ago!
