title: H. M. S. "Dreadnought."
---

Titanic craft of many thousand tons,
 A smaller Britain free to come and go,
Relying on thy ten terrific guns
 To daunt afar the most presumptuous foe;
Thick-panoplied with plates of hardened steel,
 Equipped with all the engin'ry of death,
Unrivalled swiftness in thy massive keel,
 Annihilation latent in thy breath.

"Dreadnought" thy name. And yet, for all thy size
 And strength, the ocean might engulf thy prow,
Or the swift red torpedo of the skies,
 The lightning, blast thy boast-emblazoned brow;
Thou hast thy use, but Britain's sons were wise
 To put their trust in better things than thou.
