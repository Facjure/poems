title: If Wealth Is Gone
---

If wealth is gone then something is gone!

Quick, make up thy mind,

And fresh wealth find.
If honour is gone then much is gone!

Seek glory to find,

And people then will alter their mind.
If courage is gone then all is gone!
'Twere better that thou hadst never been born.
