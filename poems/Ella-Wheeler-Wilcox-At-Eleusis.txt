 I, at Eleusis, saw the finest sight,
 When early morning's banners were unfurled.
 From high Olympus, gazing on the world,
 The ancient gods once saw it with delight.
 Sad Demeter had in a single night
 Removed her sombre garments! and mine eyes
 Beheld a 'broidered mantle in pale dyes
 Thrown o'er her throbbing bosom. Sweet and clear
 There fell the sound of music on mine ear.
 And from the South came Hermes, he whose lyre
 One time appeased the great Apollo's ire.
 The rescued maid, Persephone, by the hand
 He led to waiting Demeter, and cheer
 And light and beauty once more blessed the land.
