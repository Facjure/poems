Here you see the ruins of a former Olympic star. 
Once he had a real nose, mind you, a chin, forehead, ears, and eyes (lids and all),
And then he went pro. 

He scrambles everything, 
Even his share of his fatherâ€™s estate. 
For his kid brother showed up
(a spitting image of the former champ)
and the pug
(who looked like an outsider now)
was quietly but sternly ushered away. 

A Natural Sundial
By Traianus (The Emperor Trajan)

If you point your big nose sunward
And open your gaping mouth, 
All who pass by
Will know the time of day.
