A. What are you upset about?
B. I’m in love. 
A. With who?
B. A virgin.
A. Is she good looking? 
B. Drop dead gorgeous. 
A. Where did you meet her? 
B. At a dinner party. We were sitting on the same couch. 
A. You think you’ll get in?
B. Yes, yes, my friend, but I don’t wish to broadcast it. Actually I want it to be nice and discreet. 
A. You mean you want to avoid marriage?
B. My friend, I found out she isn’t worth a dime. 
A. You know this already. You are not in love, dear friend. You are lying. How can your heart be madly in love when it calculates so well?
