Priapus poems:

Religious ladies, please don't look:
Shield you eyes from shameless verses.
They don't give a damn; they head right
For it. In the know, these ladies. 
They took look on cocks with pleasure. 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just don't get caught. I won't exact a tax
In cudgel blows nor slash you with my axe:
My foot long pole will leave you so well cleft
Your asshole won't have any wrinkles left. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Girl, watch your cunt; boy, keep your ass from grief.
Another threat awaits the bearded thief. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My cock's great size results in one delight:
I've never fucked a girl who wasn't tight. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If boy, or man, or woman steals I hump
(in converse order) pussy, head, and rump.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bailiff of a fertile garden plot
Appointed this my designated spot.
You'll pay the price, thief, even if you squeal,
"For just one fucking cabbage?" "That's the deal."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I could simply die, Priapus, 
From the shame of talking dirty, 
But when you expose your naked
Balls to me (you shameless godhead),
Cock and cunt are standard usage. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Scythed god whose part is greater than the whole,
which way, Priapus, if the spring's my goal?"
"Right through the vineyard. If you steal a grape, 
you'll need that spring to get your mouth in shape."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You'll get fucked, thief, for the first time.
If you're caught again, you suck me. 
Should you try a third incursion,
Just to suffer both together, 
You'll give fuck and suck in sequence. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whatever it is, I shouldn't hesitate
Since I'm cocksure enough to tell you straight. 
I want your ass, you want to pluck my fruit;
If I get what I want, you'll get your loot. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't assume each threat is uttered
As a joke or witticism.
Every thief I catch will three and 
Four times serve me with a blow job. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That that part of me is dripping 
For which I am called Priapus
Isn't due to dew or frost.
No, it drips spontaneously 
When I think of kinky wenches. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't pretend I didn't warn you:
In a thief and out a faggot.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You who avoid my manhood
Modestly avert your glances:
Oh, come on -- you're scare to look, but
In your guts you know you want it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your mouth's all set for fig fruit
And you're set to grab a handful, 
Look at me, thief, and consider
How you'll leave my cock beshitted. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
