Sappho
Standing by my bed
in house shoes
dawn that very
moment woke me
Sappho
I asked myself
what, Sappho, can
you give to one
who has everything, 
like God? 
Sappho
Though they are
just breath, words
which I command
are immortal 
Sappho
This afternoon
girls ripe to marry
wove flower -- 
heads into necklaces
Sappho
It's no use,
mother dear, I 
can't finish my
chores
	 Blame God
perfect as he is
He has almost 
killed me with
love for a boy 
Sappho
Twilight's first star
is the most
stunning
of all stars
Sappho
Without warning
As a whirlwind
Swoops on an oak
An idea shakes my heart
Sappho
If you will come
I will put out
new pillows for
you to rest on 
Sappho
I was so happy
Believe me, I 
Prayed that that
Night might be
Doubled for us
Sappho
She was dressed well:
Her feet were hidden
Under embroidered 
Sandal straps -- fine
Handwork from Asia. 
Sappho
Afraid of losing you
I ran trembling
Like a little girl
After her mother
Sappho
It is clear now:
Neither honey nor
The honeybee is
To be mine again
Sappho
Day in, day out
I hunger and 
I struggle
Sappho
You will say
See, I have come 
Back to the soft
Arms I turned from
In the old days
Sappho
Tell me
Out of all
Mankind, whom
Do you love
Better than 
You love me?
Sappho 
I said, Sappho
Enough! Why
Try to change 
Another's heart?
Sappho
You may forget but
Let me tell you
This: someone in
Some future time
Will think of us
Sappho
Last night
I dreamed that
You and I had
Words: God
Sappho 
Many times
I've wished I 
Had luck like that
Sappho
That was different
My girlhood then
Was in full bloom
And you -- 
Sappho

This way, that way
I don't know
What to do: I 
Am of two minds
Sappho 
I ask you, sir, to
Stand face to face
With me as a friend
Would: show me the
Favor of your eyes
Sappho
Sappho, when some asshole
Explodes rage
In your breast
Hold back 
Your tongue!
Sappho 
Experience shows us
Wealth unchaperoned 
By Virtue is never
A harmless neighbor 
Sappho 
We know this much
Death is an evil;
We have the gods'
Word for it; they too
Would die if death
Were a good thing
Sappho 
You remind me
Of a very gentle
Little girl I once
Watched picking flowers
Sappho
God bless you
May you sleep then
On some tender
Girlfriend's breast
Sappho
Must I remind you, my daughter,
That sounds of grief 
Are unbecoming in
A poet's household?
And they are not
Suitable in ours?
