Archilocus

The fox knows many tricks, the hedgehog only one. 
One good one. 
Archilocus 
I never gave a shit what men thought
That way I enjoyed myself
Archilocus

I don't envy God' power
Who wants to be king?
Archilocus 
I'm some kind of unknown master of
I really don't know or care
Archilocus
Her breasts and her dark hair
Were perfume, and even an old man would love her. 
Archilocus

One great thing I know:
How to stick evil up the ass
Of a man who's done it to me




Archilocus
Don't rejoice if you win
Don't grieve if you lose
From now on believe nothing except nothing
Let nothing astonish you
Even if horses graze on the sea
And dolphins munch on grass
And the loud sea itself by a farmer who loves hills
Is loved more than those hills



Archilocus
I lopped off a soldier's genitals
I lifted a cricket by the wing








Archilocus
Curly-haired idiot, I gobble some bread:
My shield can't be found anyplace,
Not one dear friend is left to walk with.
Archilocus 

As the fig tree on its rock feeds many crows, 
So this simple girl sleeps with strangers. 
Archilocus
And to fall upon her heaving belly, 
And thrust your groin into her groin, 
Your thighs between her thighs. 
Archilocus
 
Feeble now are the muscles in my mushroom. 
Archilocus
His penis is swollen 
Like a donkey 
Taking his fill of barley.
Archilocus
Enormous was the gold he amassed
From many years of work, 
But all
Fell into the luscious arms
Of a gold digging whore. 
Archilocus
I don't like a general 
Who towers over the troops,
Lordly with perfect haircuts
And trimmed mustaches. 
Give me a stumpy soldier
Glaringly bowlegged
Yet rock solid on his feet
And in his heart a giant. 
Archilocus
I want to bone you
Just as when I am thirsty I want to drink. 
Archilocus

How can I like the way she makes love?
Give me sweet figs before sour wild pears. 
Archilocus
A life of doing nothing is good for old men, 
Especially if they are simple in their ways, 
Or stupid, or inane in their endless blabber
As old men tend to be. 
Archilocus
Broad earth, now you entomb two of my friends
Who were two tall columns of this island. 










































Archilocus
Lady, you are much too old 
To rub yourself with perfume. 























Down
By Archilocus translated By Stephen Berg
Wait. Listen. Don't move.
There's a girl working in your house
Who's so beautiful, so alive
Anyone would want her. 
We should sit down
Some night over wine and I'll tell you
How often I've seen in my mind
The tight silky hair of her cunt
Glistening beneath the moon
And wanted to ease my tongue in.
Remember that great saying -- 
Love gives men things other than the pure face of God to enjoy? 
I confess
Once, months ago, 
I took her into the fields -- it was spring: shaggy
Tall red flowers bobbed in the grass everywhere. 
I helped her down and slid my hands under her neck
And pillowed her with my wool cloak.
She sat up for a second, afraid 
But I kissed her nipples gently, with such tenderness
How could I stop myself
From dropping between her thighs. 
She quieted and let me touch her everywhere, 
Her firm skin shone, sweating with lust, 
I licked her throat, armpits, feet, navel, knees, 
And in her for the first time came
The moment my wild cock
Sank halfway in -- 
To her thick, blond, flowery bush.
