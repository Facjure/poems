Hercules and the Cart Driver
By Aesop 

His cart stuck in mud, a cart driver prayed 
to Hercules to come and aid.
"Up!" says the God, "you lazy dog
and lift the axle from the bog;
do you think the Gods have nothing to do
but listen to such dumbasses as you?"













































The Wolf and the Shepard's Boy
By Aesop

A shepherd's wanker son
Scared his neighbor's with exclamation;
"The wolf! the wolf!" And when they came,
Their labor lost made his game.
At last, when the wolf was there,
His real cries they did not hear;
He and his flock a prey were made,
And for his lies he dearly paid.
Those who are known to talk shit,When they speak truth, are not trusted.
