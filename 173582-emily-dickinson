title: Emily Dickinson

The distance that the dead have gone
  Does not at first appear;
Their coming back seems possible
  For many an ardent year.
And then, that we have followed them
  We more than half suspect,
So intimate have we become
  With their dear retrospect.


















Emily Dickinson on Death

Death is like the insect
  Menacing the tree,
Competent to kill it,
  But decoyed may be.
Bait it with the balsam,
  Seek it with the knife,
Baffle, if it cost you
  Everything in life.
Then, if it have burrowed
  Out of reach of skill,
Ring the tree and leave it, —
 'T is the vermin's will.















Emily Dickinson
Each that we lose takes part of us;
  A crescent still abides,
Which like the moon, some turbid night,
  Is summoned by the tides.
